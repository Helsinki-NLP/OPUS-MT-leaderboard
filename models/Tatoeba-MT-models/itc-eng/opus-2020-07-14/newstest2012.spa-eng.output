Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the exclusion of the Minister, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes at the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of a disadvantageous agreement with Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet firm, the appeal court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former prime minister was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
For approval, 226 votes were required.
Libya’s Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no more war.
It's up to define who the winner is.
As is already customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it's about dilucidating whether it's moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has brought into force the traditional law, the sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off their hands.
Women can already forget to be emancipated and the apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, made up of warriors tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters accept the help of unfaithful dogs gratefully.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, NATO attacks did not lead them to an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When they seek winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
Following recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the premises do not pose a problem to expel the "crosses"
But without occupation will the oil tankers get made with Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that it is not, but it may be that the West can finally presume to protect human rights.
As long as the sharia followers don't cross us.
Starts a new era of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe go into the search for investors
A statistical torbell has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquatrimestral period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer only set in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, in Germany has improved more than expected (an increase of 0.3% rather than expected 0.1%), although in France a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the interquatrimestral period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to ČSU, the trend towards gradual deceleration in the growth of economic development is consistent.
The results are even worse than analysts' forecasts.
Main events:
Meanwhile, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but four-monthly has stagnated.
In the third trimester, the German economy, according to the previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen internationally at 5.2%.
The interest of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation also begins to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the Czech bonds at 10 years of age remain at 4%, although the situation in the area is worsening.
In Germany, voices are raised saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs are classified for the Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a bonus of 200 million.
The soccer team is doing the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant Porter Petr Jiraček, victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, stood out fantastically against the attacks of the local team, so that the European Championship will not be missed.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a detailed report.
There was almost excitement in the first half and a good luck dose in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiraček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its pass at the European Championship.
Due to the very Czech defence, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured parties were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who allowed two major occasions to pass.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the quote of the Cup of Europe, so the National Football Archives will reach a gratification of approximately 200 million crowns.
A good offensive game has been played since the first few minutes.
Both teams worked just to keep the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, patadones to the other defence field, just what the Czech defense knew to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for your country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying on Tuesday at noon in front of the facilities and then crowned death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahán human shields around the nuclear technology center where they work with uranium.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend your country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, noted that Iran, according to all indications, is struggling to achieve nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students prayed at noon at the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the central of Isfahan, but also the facilities of Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: don't breakfast and dinner stuffed
Over one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity at 5%.
Obesity children come in most families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current research.
The importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference, is again demonstrated.
At the table, obese children, for example, feed on embites at least twice as often as children in families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence".
In overweight families, there is no habit of practicing sports, which applies to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and attended the same nearly 900 basic education children from all over Chechnya.
It was already the second edition of the program "The obesity of is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th course.
A proper diet and sufficient exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of children with overweight and even obesity.
"Only half of the children polled have responded that they have five daily meals according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, lunch, lunch, lunch and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with lunch
Experts warn that, in a healthy development, details are important, as well, they also tell, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In Chechnya, however, only 23 per cent of school families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one breakfasts alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of the homes there was nothing breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that the families of obese children are more often consumed with fried potatoes.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily sweet refreshments (70%).
Generally, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed are sports, but among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12-15 years, from a healthy diet point of view, are far from ideal."
Among its favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of sweet refreshments is particularly alarming," the final report of the study states.
As the main food the palm is taken pasta and follows it closely with the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who filled out the questionnaire after the end of the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", in many cases an important change was made in favour of the principles of healthy food," points out the results of the study.
It draws attention, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal and current water.
Children would also more often choose beef and fish for main food in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour products.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, support professionals
In the introductory article, How the stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals in the industry, how to dress up problematic characters and also a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer final reviews, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is no longer a pin.
We've studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there's no man) about how to dress the woman who doesn't have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the great majority.
Someone is cuellicorto, someone has a stylized figure without proper curves and someone suffers overweight.
The stylist must know to optically soften wide shoulders, stretch a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given some tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the kind of Jennifer López, of huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress it too challengingly
If, for example, the difference between waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants are not adapted, it is worth getting stitched at least one piece of extra fabric to measure.
They will certainly not repent, because the clothing that feels perfect is unattainable.
With a tailor-made skirt you will feel a lot better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to dress with folds, ornaments, embroidery or flags.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I'm glad I have all week to order all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid that with the task assigned, I have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom two clothingmakers must be designed: one for the day and one for the night.
The current aspect, the fashion style that suits the person in question, must be taken into account.
I've been "dressed" at Miranda Kerr, maybe the acquaintance of Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently fattened about 100 kilos (please consider exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
Dresses have to cut them off from magazines or search the Internet and print them, then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The designer, therefore, did not view only physically, but also takes care, for example, of the product pages in the magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, pockets, shelters, etc.).
Of all this, the designer and designer Mario Kameník spoke to us.
But all this is already left for Sunday.
The designer must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all kinds of bodies.
The fashion designer Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to take part in this.
And a good designer knows how to work with the same dress in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed classic with cowboys and shirts, but also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it was actually a dress.
Or it's enough to pick it up and climb the neck to get a completely different image.
"Play with it," he urged us.
What I value most is the following advice: "In order to start working, you need to first know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
Finally, it becomes clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out that we find different results in fashion magazines.
That's without talking about parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes on the reservation you want to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the pictures the clothing works in combination with other clothes, they are all different to those used in reality.
All of this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style they only suppose, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the Marquetin have made her a world star.
In Chechia, for the time being, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of the stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they give us a very different size than their real (minor) size.
Then it's just dripping and finding out if the heart magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/sweet, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to focus on fashion, but he has to understand the outfit.
During your work, especially you should communicate with the people you've seen, so it's essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss himself, he defends his views.
"When a director hires you to classify him as a dresser and completes him with beautiful clothes, you can't pick up and throw out everything that was there and say, "Hey what a horror."
"Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend so someone can put them in," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything must fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and all the necessary tools are there.
They are objects like scissors, scissors, chitapeluses, or impermissibles. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special front straps, if it was larger (the pins and other types of glues are not allowed, because they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
To avoid passive listening and putting something into practice, we have learned to wear the soles of our shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the study, on a flat surface, the ground could be damaged and much more the exterior could be damaged.
And we only covered and covered.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't accidentally damage them.
So you had to be very good at it.
Mario has given me joy by praising my work without reservation.
The truth is, I don't get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of all that we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedicating myself to professional stylism is not a rose path, but it gives me exactly what people say.
At Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A trip, in principle neglected, is complicated because of a series of improper neglects of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but this was of no use if, in fact, nothing was intended to be done extraordinary.
The new delivery, to which the title is added The Run, aroused great expectations already before its premiere.
I promised that I would give new air to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, as shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being a genre of action again without more.
We were also curious about how the scenes would stay, where the main character comes down from the car and walks by his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results don't vary much in terms of what we expected.
There are races that can be made for acceptable, but in the total cost, points are lost due to absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
It is not really possible to call mistakes, but rather the incomprehensible decontracing of the programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist Jack has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
This suggests that each race takes place in a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In that way, one does not have or remotely the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to the sight, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
So it's nothing from the other world.
But walking through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, the races vary from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you encounter a sandstorm that reduces visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you need to be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance to a number of required rivals (the normal in a classic race), then try to earn time (the classic timed duel) and then wait for a duel against a single opponent.
In the middle of all this, sometimes the police, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
There are interactive animations when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite fewer landscapes in the game of what could be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not get upset and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that makes the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the tracks of previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can search somewhere else.
But a career designed with a lot of action is quite suitable for this driving style, although we can find something better among competition games.
So far, everything's in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
Of games of this kind you can't expect to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very adjusted advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled piruettes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The recipes are scheduled in such a way that when you suffer from an accident or get out of the track, the game will return you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five recipes are available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something isn't right, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, neither reseteo helps, only helps him learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, one must enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Sometimes you'll find yourself in some "civile" vehicle site always with the same configuration, even if you're the first, fifth, or you're five minutes before or after.
This makes it anger especially in situations, when you see that two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you get there, you have to turn around or stop.
It's just like when you get there, because it's programmed that the "surprise" will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
During your departure you will arrive at places where, regardless of the time, you will always advance the same opponent on the same site.
Moreover, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming in front of you, so at first you can make the car butterfly.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspension and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you are probably disappointed immediately.
And it's a shame, because even though the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often not possible to follow the detail what happens or where.
And it really does the same, if merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive clues or classification in the race so that it doesn't break the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the races.
You have to be aware of gas stationers next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough of what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, for strong American cars for straight highways and for super-deportive exotics for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, i.e., there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both the challenges and the stories.
At the top level, the driver is opened up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an Autolog feature is connected online, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race is made in history.
With the car you get to the metro tunnel (pass), where you run in the dark through the tracks (pass).
The Velocimeter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (passe) and, suddenly, at the back comes the convoy of the metro and takes you forward without more.
In the writing we will probably have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors actually take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most nice cases, sometimes even superb.
What a pity that, at the most tense times, the quality of the image is reduced and, at times, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is good and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each one of his father and mother", but it may be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game were to avoid absolutely foolish mistakes, we would have trouble asserting that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
Fun is secure, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of some airport reflectors.

The EU Ambassador, Vice-nová:
The Czechs have a reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I wasn't expecting a war without a barracks."
"It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles", so the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová began with conviction his conference at the Faculty of Law.
How not to take its slogan "clear and openly about Europe", which he said already at the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU organ and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers from the Faculty of Law of the United States of Carolina.
Vice-nová also put the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first is criticism, which, if it is an insult, a gray official, able to take on any role, but I must say that he has left everyone confused, because he assumes his roles to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them, and who has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of Foreign Policy and Security is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union towards States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our Olomouc cheese.
Vice-nová has also taken up the agenda, followed and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Chechia.
Czech representation in the EU has for the moment many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good noise", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget must be approved, caused by the current economic situation, which is much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which ones less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreigners or hives that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that the cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels, the cucumbers that are curved or round, the bananas of various sizes, or that no one is going to ban the Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU's environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to European institutions.
Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
He also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
It is the fault of many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and I am approached by a Slovak, a Frenchman by my side says to me, 'What, have you already left, those of the Visegrad Group?', and you see it doesn't make him any grace."
In the future, the EU, according to Vice-Nová, is awaiting new tough new budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real about the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only the countries you want and those who don't, who stay out are cooperating."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe at both speeds," Vice-nová is expected.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Chechia and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that clearly defined IBM's strategy, the closest one would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, has already been 100 years since its foundation.
The foundation of this long-lasting character put it the first head of the signature, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already coined the slogan that many problems in the world have solutions if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised business culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fearing the changes around.
That has enabled us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century," said the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano during his birthday.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees such as the manager of Ba in Chequia (the employees of IBM were the first U.S. workers to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in the relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company was able to discover talent (as one of the first world companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without any problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, so Palmisano will replace it in the coming year a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has already worked for thirty years at IBM, where she has been the head of sales, marketing and strategies.
During the last few years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual encounters, the rain of online ideas, from which countless future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that there are ideas, for almost half a million people are working at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained an institution concept rather than a technological enterprise," says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology," notes George Colony of consultant Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world in the last hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the largest number of patents for all American technological companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Their inventions include the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill this year $220 billion. This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or PCjr IBM computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be anchored emotionally in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its foundations on other platforms (and also, if it does not work, abandons them).
And this is the difference of competition, Microsoft, which basically maintains and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is devoted mainly to services, of which approximately one fifth are programmes and another fifth of equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the supplier's share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets of a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time the modern global financial crisis was manifested.
IBM acts according to the premises of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
So far, it seems, the IBM company has been able to deal with the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the net profit of the company has not ceased to increase.
IBM's currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to space flights
The IBM (International Business Machines) company was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name was Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM is already adopted in 1924 - it was originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis that gave rise to the birth of IBM comes from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "fix clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the business man Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory advice.
Flint set the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas remain the firm basis for corporate culture and identity).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business equipment, from meat cutters and cheese to register boxes.
During the first four years of Watson’s management, the billing doubled to $9 million and the company’s huge expansion on the continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost 40 years after taking up the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide the flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the standard of computers of that time, came to the market with the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer complete advice and high value added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for these last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet."
Its objective is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances, for example, with regard to transport and city administration have been improved.
For the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform, which allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia then, the first country that had it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. There is also a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still had the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and have established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but not like my partner anymore," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová hosted Bartošové in her house during the summer, she couldn't even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved for 30 days after the singer and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina was resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even fired him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife is staying with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife wouldn't wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will."
"But here I would live not as my dear old drunken man who was wrong, but as a man to whom I am bound," Rychtářová said and added that he had already taken away his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph doesn't care if his wife shut the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife set this up as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the house, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talked to each other normally, only we didn't share a bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová finds a new love, he would not object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care where she's going or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Josef concludes.
Women's worst vices: Do they also concern you?
If I ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that can boil blood on men?
Go shopping
Do you blame your average orange that depends on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one trapitum a week?
Do you like to buy often on the shelves?
Then in your case you can say that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should pacify their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to walk without more in the clothes stores, look for clothes well adjusted and then try them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women going shopping is a pastime, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner that you better wait in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to thin for at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like it?"
Don't you hear those phrases?
Is it?
Then she's one of those women obsessed by her appearance.
It is not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing your partner complain all the time about his physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more frequent complaints, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning in the first place
It's like an infinite tiovivo.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, rub the floor, remove the powder, rub the bath and all that for at least two times a week.
Does your partner reproach you for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children who have soiled a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that so hard to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", it proves to be aware that nothing should be overstated and that order and cleaning should certainly not be of primary concern in the family.
This harmless desire for cleansing could threaten your family relationships and well-being.
Make disagreeable comments
"The used underpants are left with the dirty clothes."
"You want to put those used socks on tomorrow, too."
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If you make these cometories to your couple more times a day, you know that you can get it out of your boxes.
Of course. You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnias and chismes
Some women are also accused of slander, gossip, but also of the offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how, and why.
At best every one of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless chasm.
With the hand in the heart, this is the property of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are funny women of those who are not controlled, who love to gossip and do so often, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female team.
Jágr and Voraček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
The hockey front Jaromír Jágr took part on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assistances that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in the Carolina court and put the Czech players back on the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the play of the 39-year-old star, and took one more step and was declared a better player of the party.
Two attendances were awarded to the party and Jágr's partner Jakub Voraček.
After the meeting, Jágr said to the overseas journalists that Giroux had preached a great night.
"Before the party told him I'd make triplet."
"I was presenting it."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance he gave Giroux a goal, following the first stretch of the Flyers.
A while later, the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trail.
Voraček was made with the record behind the Hurrican gates and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, which scored.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part the Flyers had already dominated.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr, he set the third goal, after his shot crashed through the fourth of Wayne Simmonds's storeroom.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player on the field, but he's definitely among the best three," Jágr put his center.
"I'd never have seen it happen that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very satisfied with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years at NHL, my colleagues were playing for me, and that now produces results," says Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again from Dwyer, from penalti, to a goal away.
Matt Read allowed no further complications, although they ended up outnumbered by two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He took the record off, I took speed, and Read went away to the farthest part."
"I tried to tie him to the record and I'm glad I got it," Voraček said the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has been at the head of the East Conference.
The Czech defender of the Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second third, he retired for an injury at the top of the body.
Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defence experience, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec was not able to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were new."
"Finally, but against that you can't do anything, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"So much to rotate the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And so we left blank," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
The doorman Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over the Tampa Bay.
Jets goals were marked by five players who ended a series of defeats that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on vacation to the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime declined to the west and the journeys of the Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Czecheslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually not even by the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West in those times, but one was supposed to put on the tail with a sleeping bag and spend all night, or have "well-known" in the agency.
Still not all of it was won.
The so-called "change promise" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable agent", which so could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak coin was not a convertible currency and, without guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs spent their vacation in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way to travel the Czechs has suffered a genuine revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was not going to spend vacations in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, which we are no longer aware of today, the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989, could not travel freely, because it was part of the Yugoslavia then.
In the early 1990s visa waiver was imposed to travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, causing a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, were not seen crowds of excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris Czech groups were sleeping in parks in tents, since our incomes at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of the cheques of that time was to take with you food (conservations, embutted, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the conversion of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy free Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it average wages, which led to an increase in travel demand around 1997.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began regularly from 1997 to prepare trips using charter flight connections, which brought down the prices of travel compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 90th century, the Czechs already traveled visa-free to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Chequia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have become faraway and hot countries. This winter will fly directly from Chequia to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States eliminated visas for Czech tourists, which led to our country being among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent on travel abroad more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head, including expenses at the place of stay.
Called Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up dead again.
For almost five months now, Czech football has been without president and Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) is likely to be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, agreement has not yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you cannot even vote to choose between the three candidates.
Interested in chairing Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June, not without calling on his colleagues to find a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hašek era, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evidenced on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národnídm), located in the Prague district of Smichov, because the talks had been blocked and not only about the method of election.
No consensus was reached or who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that moment on and because of this only point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, that representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer throw out the Executive Committee which, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically did not resolve anything.
Opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: How do we proceed in the third round to avoid the dead spot?
"The dispute revolves around whether to agree with the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, the third round will win the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will apply.
The Moravia Region is ready to reach a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The bohemia part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have at least two-thirds majority.
"This would, however, remove the meaning from the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of bicameral system," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which the best thing would not be to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Tomaš Paclík is, surprisingly, also agreed, although the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be better suited to Pelta.
"I would like it to be voted on to the maximum in accordance with the statutes."
"In order not to invent any nonsense about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," says Victoria Plzen's owner, who first applied as a candidate and directed his observations mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be pacified with the party of our national team today at the European Championship.
"Football will once again be a protagonist, and so it will be more cooperative," says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"This is not about the conflict between bohemians and moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"However, I hope the common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There's not much time left for all sides to agree.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team is complete?
The special aircraft, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, including vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could finally be held at ministerial level, which, as they count, will take place this Wednesday.
To Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, he would very much like to incorporate the parties divided into the country's most powerful sports organization in order to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sport (ČSTV) which will try to provide a new leadership to Czech sport following the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the chief of the football players in Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate who satisfied all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not appear as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not run as a candidate for the elections."
"But to this day no one has been able to find such a person," said Paclík for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, in the event of winning, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too involved with football events.
"I've already spoken to some people I might take into account."
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that at this moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What is supposed to be most annoying to Paclík at this time is the relationship of Pelta with the President of Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the General Assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case you win, the current status will be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With Berbra's support, an ambitious business man, football will make even less profit," Paclík said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a phone call during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring to Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will the UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paclík, who also took some caution his previous statement that "he would sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta became president."
In the event of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík could arise cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Similarly, the other candidate, Rajchl, has been supported by Paclyk before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as chief of the representation."
"but not as the manager of an association."
"I also don't put my noses where I don't feel able," Paclík added, who in September gave much attention to supporting the suspension of the Committee of arbitrators chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He turned to his management capabilities for private companies, since last summer he was also the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the triumph in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies against the President of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he exerted pressure on political leaders to spend more money on lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be dedicated."
"If you increase taxes on gambling, as the political parties announce, you would support your arguments, but, frankly, you have to tell us where this money is going to stop," he points out.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be "not a supporter".
Pelta is also associated with Jablnek and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the point of hypocritically yielding my actions of the Pilsen Club to another person and then coming back there after a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end with the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if elected, it would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would ultimately serve to resolve future electoral settlement disputes.
The representative of Jablnek is optimistic about the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Prior to the elections that were not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fund-raising.
He decided to take part in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could help him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels have been dealing with football for a long time and expect to meet this Thursday to the new President."
"They feel the time has come for someone to manage the partnership," the man thinks who is primarily associated with the Club of Jablonice, but who worked on the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned during the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought were adopted in the June General Assembly."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a sign to win the delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer in case this fails."
"It is a question of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Also, in theory, try not to mess with your opponents.
In the past he had warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his legal training, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not let puppets with his head.
"It's been more than a year in the world of football, and it's already achieved some successes."
"His attacks but they were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt about their true character," said his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the highest.
The latter should be a football promotion showcase.
"Assym, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I'd immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there's enough money for the whole football," ČTK told the 46-year-old candidate two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as chairman of football would not entail any personal changes to the staff.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," she said, referring to Strahov, where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are foretold at the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel to Nymburk in vain this Thursday.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly succeed in overcoming it.
"Football needs credibility, which will be recovered only if it finally has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in its career as representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, FAČR would start working eagerly.
If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected in the fourth General Assembly as the new President of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be disappointed.
Rajchl promises that if he was elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, raising more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself to football completely."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or the training of high-performance young footballers."
"With this I don't mean to say that I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can devote himself to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of these segments, move forward with great momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered not to present itself again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me that I must not give up, because then others would also be defeated."
"It's about having faith not to give up like this, no more," he said.
As they say, he is also motivated to continue the work he has already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, a large part of the work that I don't want is now lost."
"There are processes that have begun and that will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he expressed concern that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before the Hašek era.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be a privilege for a few chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not for the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to play a football for everyone, because that's the only way they'll feel good for everyone and not just for the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that the president would only be bohemian.
"Although some people try to assert otherwise, I have in mind to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech and another Moravian, whose winners would go to the first division."
"It would not be given the current situation in which we have only three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although the presidential election was won by Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl does not stop believing in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel strongly supported by the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include the saving of tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his part of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "unqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In case it is elected, it will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and it would not significantly change the staff's staffing on the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Blue Jump
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible optical, sumptuous bathrooms in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can live their wonderful blue, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their legs tired in bubble baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missing in his luggage, a bathrobe.
Behind the water, he looked at the artistic dome on the top, swam toward the marble angels, who waited for him at the edge of the pool and amazed himself at the modernist indoor pool, carefully restored.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectonic historian Meder explored over 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic baths of the bathroom in the Black Forest, the "constructions of concrete" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe" for 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the culture of the bathroom.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that the fans of the bathroom have to conform to blue tiles and chlorine heath, while the amateurs to run can breathe the fascinating smell of the fir forests or listen to the cheerful threesomes of the birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why the pools must always be so ugly," says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The roofing in the pool and the ethereal sauna oils. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because they handle all the senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "In place of floor, in the bathrooms there is a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically folded: the high vaults, the coloured tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on architecture and art history in the historical oasis of well-being, but, above all, it is eager to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding examples in his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medical baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath, water with nitrates is found in a unique karst cavity (cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a few thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts eyes on the ceiling pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, from the outdoor pool of a bathroom in St.Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like an ovni that just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam up in the winter, while at the bottom the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the scent with chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulphur, in the Arpád baths in Békssaba, Hungary, the gas oil plague is so strong that people think they have reached a health bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legamo stick to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered pools and sunbathings in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, he found himself with a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the stunning windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the weeds grow between the tiles.
The decline was in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; not only can neo-Romanic elements of times be discovered from their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall of the Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its stunning modernization in 1995, the Palacio Termal is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," says Meder.
In a palace like this, immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Renouncing the Deutsche Bank to your business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to verify the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the consortium chief wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to one study, that 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study was based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that global raw material bags bets raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer defender is directed in particular to Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, bets on raw materials were designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that the players have decommissioned the offers and demands, and draw profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "we deserve to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The growing betting at food prices shows in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks currently harm public well-being."
Ackermann is the largest banker, especially in the obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money at stake for food price bets," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of hungry people or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
The Ackermann inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the consortium head wants to offer a perfect image just a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different than not planned in the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation can perfect your image.
And he needs to just care about possible losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would annul investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were betted.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all the investments that come from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would discourage a bank so well-known, 49 percent would seek, after reflection, cancel, and change to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The Pavilion Transferred
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights and a happy ending, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and collapsed.
Now it's reopened as a house of exhibitions.
Modern postgerra architecture passionately, the clear shapes, crystal halls, brave curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
To date, construction is considered to be a contemporary milestone of architecture.
He made the architect so well-known that he also built the Austrian pavilion in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building flattened in Munich, it became internationally known.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions rose after the universal exhibition at Schweizer Garten next to the southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was inaugurated inside.
The building was suitable but lacking the suitable spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, no good environment.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is declining more and more.
Today, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "House 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Belvedere Museum, which belongs to the house, was inaugurated with the first exhibition, a lucky blow in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belgian gallery since 2007, made a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a professor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic skater on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, Guggenheim Museum and founder director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, carried out reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba from the homonymous foundation should be exhibited, there should be a café and a library and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he significantly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, extended it and awarded it the contest, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Vienna Technical University and the pavilion was for him a "great and important place", in which he considered "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew about the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his change of use generously and easily.
In the current reforms there are great problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the glass façade was changed, a glass fiber-enforced insulating glass crystal was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or replaced and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old shades falling and protected from oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly the way it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and would also like the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and warns of a rough soil in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
That of the flag "who came from Brussels" has been difficult, said recently Krischanitz, a typical "caseless appearance in the history of the city".
An architecture like this is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awaken the proper consciousness."
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been a completely new and planned "central station neighborhood", with houses and offices, located next to Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another blow of luck: House 21 could get a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, negotiates with the city over a neighbouring place in Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that rises to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid the fault of the trains in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the losses and delays of the trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a journalistic report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments up to 2005 of a total of about EUR 300 million.
For this, the availability of vehicles and the rail network must be improved with extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the roads and from the Andeans.
The aim is to clean the snow and ice pads for operation and 90 percent of the needles required for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of accidents and delays in the trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of travellers, as, inter alia, he lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in delivering high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of the high-speed trains frequently at the workshop, after a high-speed train had broken an axle at the central station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millionaire fines in the United States
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the United States acquires the giant in the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in an agreement to put an end to the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
The NCAUA financial market regulator criminalizes many large banks inducing credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
These securities lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to the courts," said a spokesman for the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which made a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, President of NCAUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in the event of bankruptcy to protect customer investments.
NCUA is attempting to reinstate the losses of millions originating.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also called for accounts to other large banks and in summer had filed complaints against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial entities.
In September 2008, at the high point of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results occurred a few years ago, it is currently blowing a complicated wind for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have set up countless processes to receive compensation or to punish shortcomings.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of claims.
Reproachs the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. State Mortgage Agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has an FHFA demand, which is worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires that the Frankfurt Institute respond to "substantial losses", without appointing an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The Guru of Finance, Buffett, invests forcefully in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always said not to invest in computer companies or information technology since the long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM's commercial report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He had to understand long before IBM offers about all services and searches computer systems for other business information technology departments.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive information technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett currently unveiled at the CNBC economics station that has acquired shares of IBM worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has raised one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the engagement until now.
He praised the leadership that addressed the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative information technology services such as the operation of calculation centres.
The old 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said he was just investing in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 1960s and, with wise investments, extended it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life - style is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense to earn money has given him the nickname of "Omaha's Oracle."
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM shares in stock went up one percent.
"The Blue Giant", as IBM is known, has a stock exchange value of over 220 billion dollars and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that relives again.
The murders of eight small, trick and Greek entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a background from the far right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, he has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin a ghost that was believed to be dead long ago, since the fire-shaped attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that xenophobia exists in Germany.
The ultra-rightist network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Do the bloody ideology relive again?", entitled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" notes on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightist pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, on the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a lookout at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn event of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, as a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary", says the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Have X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
"Start smelling bad," says the title of the Ahmet Külahci column.
He noted that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the German web forums of Turkish origin, police behavior and subsequent success in the search are very critically discussed.
The authors are amazed that the German authorities have not sought suspects in the ultra-right circle long before.
Some are less rhetorical about the drastic media: "From here on, it is lost, immigrants are left with only self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The inner peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the penalty to the entire network," says Selen.
This means that, if the inner peace of Germany is at risk, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in the German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past mistakes
Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire-shaped attack by Solingen, he sent a telegram of sympathy to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what contributed to the taxes of the Turks in Germany.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his tax.
The current information from the Turkish media shows how profound it has been since the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time we need frank words.
The Zurich lake scandal bank
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost broke into the financial crisis, and since then it has slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now she's running a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After its spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, it was known in July that it would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the administrative council of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, commends Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired strength and lets down friendly observations about its future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm glad to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and failed EUR 1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, director general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the USB administrative board has since been considered equally touched, and everyone has asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber has been advised to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the Administrative Council in May, not early in 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, an economic and counsellor and has had a certain period of adaptation necessary.
Suddenly he is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved that he deserves the title "the biggest bank of the European scandal" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset administrator, and on the other, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the old man so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the manager of discreet and solid Swiss property, but also handy, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the major banks of the world.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later banker in Zurich for many years, explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one asks: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very badly on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, director general, who until then was regarded as a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was set up in high-risk losses and had to depreciate billions.
To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, that some had looked with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the Administrative Council, in 2006 at the second best paid administrative council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic UBS values for many billions, the Helvetica Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bonus, making it the bank's co-ownership.
All Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, bank expert.
The first catastrophe joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS captivated a fiscal conflict with America and demonstrated willingness to deliver the data of wealthy customers, who may have cheated taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves an amount of $780 billion, the reimbursement of unjustified profits of these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less that it had helped in tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in competition by rich customers: the discretionary aureola.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the chairman of the board and the chairman of the administrative board.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through erroneous speculation and in the administration of goods by aiding tax fraud.
And just when I was again feeling a little calmer, just when it was thought that the UBS was going back to get it, this unsolicited operator's story happens, an individual operator failed 1.7 billion euros before the bank realized that something was going wrong.
And it was revealed, of course, that this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"In the case of Adobe, risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers have long been present, came to be the guardians of the greatest goods in the world: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break to the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich does not fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main seat on the Bahnhofstraße street in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to the Lake Zurich, framed by snowcapped summits of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry such as Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses as Sprüngli would confess.
The Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, passing through the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS by means of a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank there is a large sign to indicate "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the great Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, in the end he does, like all the Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both major banks.
The UBS has become too large, and it believes, especially in the investment bank, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, gave up its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the large Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the greatest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("UBS crash" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the large bank of the bankruptcy.
How do you do?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so you see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too large for the small Swiss, and continues to grow.
For this reason, the two different precursor banks of the UBS were complementary: a rich but sleepy bank with the centre of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could drive a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that managed to open up steps from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel became Wuffli's.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: Desatino arrived before the case.
The employees of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of directors, at which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: To get off the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well for him.
In foreign exchange and share trading, it was at the highest.
However, the company advisors in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed income", there is enormous compensation for large banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these voids, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost its existence.
As growth cravings, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine to hold American mortgage credits and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, as other banks have been looking for the descent for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, bank expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The posts in the UBS became projectable seats and are currently unsafe.
Currently, the leader of a large bank has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, focus on the administration of goods, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get so far (yet).
But the investment bank must be greatly reduced, it is clear at the moment.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only 51-year-old Italian suicide was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank split surprisingly from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he was imposed: He must direct the business of the UBS on a permanent basis, the bank of Zurich communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the middle of the 1990s.
Delete 3,500 posts.
But this isn't enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to earn money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is sure to ask at the moment.
So far he just says he'll first find a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart Graces Expand in Cities
In many places fats are considered "problem birds": these very intelligent animals from cities are not expelled for a long time, experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly, the graces have been part of the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors for the perch and the noise of the animals are accumulated.
Although no means has appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
Graces no longer leave the cities, experts say at the first symposium on fats in Leer, East Frisia.
There experts from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to migration of certain protected fats; chemical applications in agriculture clearly end up with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing building and falling trees that house them make life difficult for birds.
The Graces are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westfalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, the negative press headlines jumped a controversial project to kill the district fats in mass.
Critics have qualified the hunting of animals by trapping birds and killing with sticks as especially brutal.
"Arousing them and evading them in a normal way is not achieved," said Werner Klöver, Leer's urbanist and landscaper.
Shooting with water to the nests or throwing the trees is usually unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert of Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals deviate, the great colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Running them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, residences of elders or colleges.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, opinion Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
It is possible to combine sensitive residential animals with baits to re-indulge elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against the purpose of treating animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can handle a peak on the face with aploma."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit about the fats of Ascheberger, where signs report on the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms of the noise of the birds: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the graces not only take advantage of the resources to access little shale, but also manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at Cambridge University checked in four degrees until the intelligence of birds arrives.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform in order to reach a moth larvae.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning fats had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a shell larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the peak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube shooter.
Three of the four Graces got it in the first attempt.
Portugal in Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo

After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself on the ground (36.).

After the break, the European Vice-Champion in 2004 clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended up with the last doubt in the 81st minute with the goal of Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion is ranked the fifth consecutive time for the Eurocopa.

Massacre at personal level
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story about the First World War, "starts with a long dramatic person of the kind who can make one fall to his feet.
Here are some action tips: gently start this page and convert it to your bookmark pages.
He will come to know these people very well in Mr Englund's novel story, and this dramatic person will function as his GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments in which, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who grants the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you have written here is a rare book, which rightly describes as "an anti-history work".
It contains some remarkable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains, as "a book about how it happened." It deals with "feelings, impressions, experiences and mood states."
"The beauty and the pain of battle " combines the experiences in war times of more or less 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from colleges and botanists to escalators, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative drivers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, will become mad or die.
Their lives blink here as votive candles lit in a church; some new ones add to the mixture while others turn out.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only the funeral of trenches on the western front.
"The beauty and the pain of battle" moves expertly through other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hives; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that stinks to the cordata.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, do you stay or run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Fair of facts," observes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumbf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
Their stories have been obtained in most of their previously published memories, letters and other material.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and settling them with what there is.
About telling the story of a German collegegirl says: "Successors, everywhere.
"Next coffee, fake aluminium, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He keeps talking about the next food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed in meat fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There is, observed, "837 permitted substitutes for meat in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savageism and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are designed for and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that this barniz means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that cushioned and tattooed hanger."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once you resign yourself to the thought of sacrifice, you would like to think it might happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, he is horribly like "to a convicted person being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the cattle of the young century: The eloquent mass murderer and ideologically convinced with good-made clothes that executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseeable ways; there is both noble and heroic behavior.
Mr Englund spoke of the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to avoid service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of gonococcal pus, which the soldiers buy and soak their genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate will rub off on their eyes, which often leads to a blindness for life."
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way in which the war has "destined exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like No novelty on Erich Maria Remarque's front, rather than full stories.
The volume of Mr Englund joins an unconventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings that I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come from his book, pulled from between your fingers that page of dramatic personae, and burned it with a bracelet.
After a false step before, a planned assault a minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying riot helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others who were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence emphasized how the operation was posing challenges for the police department.
Recent weeks of events could not be repeated, such as the spraying of pepper spray on demonstrators, violating the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas".
That is why the police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of demonstrators revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had been prepared to see how occupations had been developed in other cities.
A major disaster was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking toward Zuccotti.
Agents increased so-called disorder training - counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter the Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels in the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but they gave up when hundreds of demonstrators appeared before long after they heard about the plans.
The operation of Tuesday involved officers from several police units, including special forces throughout the district - dozens of mobile agents that usually used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when there were the least number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with focus and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan bridge, before leaving.
The lights and prerecorded messages from loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue cutter, many protesters just picked up their things and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving time to the protesters to collect their belongings.
Other agent teams were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the Chief Spokesperson of the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been brutally treated by the agents.
Mr. Browne said the mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense maroon of personal effects of demonstrators, including luggage and bags of paper and plastic stuffed clothes, teams of the Department of Cleanliness followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of demonstrators took positions near the camp kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp lay between them by their arms.
And two people chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service officers were called to cut the candles.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The takeoff operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were by "change of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives in the department, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he wasn't running operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents was waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between the streets of Liberty and Cedar, if they had to come in.
They got up barricaded on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park.
At some point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the north perimeter.
One of the most noisy action of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., in the south of Pine Street, a protestant jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from the wheels of a police van.
At a certain point, a piece of contrachapment flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The support workers' union will sue the city for dismissals
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools that care for poor students.
The demand is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, from the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Sixty-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the city's worst-paid people lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund from working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At a hearing in the City Council last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said that dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council countered saying that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the school support staff would be dismissed.
Municipal District officials 37 said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the claim, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The demand will include Mr. Walcott and the City's Education Department as accused, and has eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all black or Latin women, as well as most of the workers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the City’s Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as they had been chronically undersubsidised.
It is noted that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and a few dismissals at schools at Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school participants lost their jobs at the 23rd District in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired at Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The budget of the 36 district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that the principals of secondary schools may have been deceived by language in a memorandum that authorizes the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excessive" to describe the action, although "excessive" more often describes the act of transferring a school payroll teacher to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were dismissed," says the complaint draft, "and not only in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that eventually Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muamar the Gadafi to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "validity".
"This resolution is to honor the braves of Libya, when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a two-party statement of support for its democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties were fighting each other and with the White House on drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the camera also rejected a measure that would have cut the funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress sufficiently upset as to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not as angry as actually to reap the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs " congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "he praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their partners in the coalition who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it divide the legislators as the June Bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the main Republican of the committee.
The spokesman of Place said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Chapter, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the whole assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not in the absence of attempts.
Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budget balance only in the House, and another punching that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially new Republicans who seek to refine their curricula - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that Congress members can perform, while representative José E. Serrano (Democrat by New York) wants to remove the limit of two mandates for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment that prohibits homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits burning flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as members have been when proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than they were in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly presented more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Giffords talks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot at him in a constituent act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat by Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with the Broadway melody "The sun will come out tomorrow" and said he wanted more than he wanted back to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords was struggling to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, passing from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the House to issue his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, he killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "It's good enough."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special program, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A story of courage and hope".
The special program analyzed Giffords' recovery from the 8 January shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband cheers her up.
Months later, you see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach you how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A frenzy of lips.
And then his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords delivered another word - "ally", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcasted by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: You see Congressman singing along with therapists songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who has been on therapy for two hours every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords an article in the newspaper about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is arrested in a Missouri prison and is being heavily medicated while waiting for trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"I swear, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, "'Gabby, you haven't been defeated," said Kelly.
"You've only been beaten.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back with more force than ever."
Troops make me feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and sailors broke into their positions around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Major State, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They showed them as a kind of orphaned child," wrote the officer in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an American public often distant, sometimes adorative.
The troops are praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public is acting more and more as if the uniformed ones were to be punished.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and soon left for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the audience they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the conversations on regret are held in silence and in private between veterans of war.
After their two children returned from fighting with the Marine Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people besides the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be a "wrong and violent veteran below the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level job of the government in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly whether he would be able to endure under pressure from a demanding Washington job immediately after his fight tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to cope with negative impressions," Cancian reminded his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
Achievements in the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that is unfamiliar with the military and sees little direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praises of politicians and the public are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The Army Faces Growing Pressure to End Rape · Global Voices
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their supposed passivity in the face of rape.
Otherwise, hundreds of plaintiffs are being organized for the next one.
The first soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a colleague.
It was October 2008, and he went back to his barracks at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who wore a 12-bit beer package.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It sounded like an alarm signal," says Lyman.
However, the Texas native left aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
Within a few minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him behind, pulling her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and old military personnel eagerly await a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the demand they have brought against the ex-secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the generalized violation of the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claim that they were sexually raped or assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed in investigating, prosecuting, or providing adequate justice after alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going to get the Army's biggest plan, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from top to bottom," she says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Their strategy: Instead of accumulating all applicants in this case, putting all eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defence, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or old soldiers by the injuries suffered by the armed forces.
The federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by staff in active service by a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called Doctrina Feres.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiff's military service," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely make clear the front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers' teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: 150 women soldiers have died between those two wars and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are in progress, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a demand against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of "personal disorder" assigned to victims of rape in order to lift them from the service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing him of discriminatory practices in the way in which it handles claims of benefits for persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the attacks are remarkably underreported , and by the Pentagon ' s own estimates, which account for approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the army were in trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his violation 11 times different from a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended an audience before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared themselves a personal witness on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work--I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatry unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my command officer, ""That was not his trial, that was my trial."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released from the service under less and less honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his suitors continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as the responsibility.
And he adds, "Probabilities are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the audience doesn't go its way, Burke, lawyer of the plaintiffs, will put the queue on his other hundreds of suitors for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform occurs," she says.
"Or until we die, what happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having killed in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time that preceded his attack on his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to get on Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a report recently published on European digital populism by the British Centre of Studies DEMOS.
The personal information link on Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way sellers have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans from right-wing groups across Europe and then they gave them advertisements, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving on Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's an entirely new way to do an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry with immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content pieces per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating an increase in research, boosting the number of academic jobs with the name of the site on the title up to nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study the people you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to poll people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go through the party, and they would never allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook eliminates all that--you go to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that university students who spoke about her rubber exploits on Facebook had a significantly greater risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counsellors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishes too many state updates with his drunks.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinking" to its own population for data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and an index of National Happiness (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders long ago claim that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to store your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their off-line data, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining his profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, on a 2006 study that conducted with the public walls of students' Facebook.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even off-line, there's no guarantee that an investigation issue is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information on the profile of a user and the messages of the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do out of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a pen and pen are still the best research tools no one can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to the real people," she says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of the social is still happening offline."
"Friend and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes its first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Temple Knights," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, as it received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I do not declare myself guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "I didn't want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he is locked under the key.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor to the Norwegian station NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a blue dress and tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at the journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be advised that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't seem like it," said a relative of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seemed."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, are shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans could find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently rediscovered, which has been dusted up as the advancement of a number of special projections in the largest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the commercial processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a designer, dreamer and self-recognizable hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a young man from the flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (The Triumph of the Nerds) on the dawns of the personal computer, and sat with Jobs for more than an hour for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively in his new NeXT computer company, awaiting popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs died that a full copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This file material, slightly reedited, is Steve Jobs' base: The 68-minute missed interview, which arrives at the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate deep interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points during the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism goes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to Cringely's questions, pushing him to move faster towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see doing good and bad, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs' career, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the dreamer eager at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always wondered, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way you do it."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes their efforts to simplify Apple's accounting in detail.
Unfounded by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made with a good copper eye, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that the commercial costs could be determined in detail.
On the Pope's joke:
Jobs tells the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack effectively the phone company and make free long distance calls.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describes how he and Wozniak tried the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were engaging things around the world a half a dozen times and shouting through the public phone and going back a minute later to the public phone at the door next door," Jobs says with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think there never existed Apple without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to talk to the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the U.S. diplomat, the two burst into carcasses just before the Pope himself was awakened to go to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, in the spare parts hunt to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the telephone guide and made a call to him.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and what good they were dealing with their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a little cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with him.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and lose time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improvising innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of base cards, he asked a customer if he could mount the entire equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they shouted that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I crashed and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before it led Apple's rebirth, Jobs propheticly predicted how many industry leaders would stumble into their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"You say you work in IBM or Xerox, so you do better photocopiers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so these kinds of people who end up leading companies and product managers are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position may be caused by people who do not have the notion of good products versus bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the big idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't make the electrons, the glass makes them, the robots make them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - all fit together...
At the end, everything is reduced to taste - it is lowered to try to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What made Macintosh big was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met in private to consider the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were engaged in a dinner sponsored by the signature of lawyers who would expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study carefully the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a demand made by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care approved by Congress last year, a law that had been a cry of war for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit the application and, in fact, a 5-and-a-half-hour historical argument is expected for March, and the outcome will probably further disturb the 2012 presidential career that will be in full swing at the time the court's decision becomes known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be discarded will probably be Paul Clement, who served as a U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush's government.
Clement's Bar Association, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated to the defence of conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were not, they could be said to fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge can attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, an honored guest, or be included in the program of such an event. "
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was sufficient to alarm ethical activists in the government.
"This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who appeal to the court by the same rules as apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Common case).
"The judges were gifted in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in fund-raising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticisms that say they mix the court's activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as to be impartial now.
Kagan has given no indication that he is going to do it.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
The Emirates airline asks for 50 double-pass aircraft Boeing 777, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than a billion dollars.
It is rarely news when a company obtains an order of 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. planes and the selling price for the 50 planes amounts to a record of 18 billion dollars.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing from future aircraft orders.
In a study on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that for the next 20 years the airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest order of the story for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 double-passed Boing 777 jets.
The successful request came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total selling price to 26 billion dollars, announced Boeing at the Dubai Air Show 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which assumes a fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," said the analyst at Morningstar Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to the airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - it is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
That is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, said Dihora.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The request of the Emirates solidifies Boeing's leadership in the market for wide-ranging rocket planes and helps keep track of his competitor Airbus SAS' attempt to invade his domain with the passenger plane A350.
Boeing's victory at the air fair took place four months after Airbus said he was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped his PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo, in the governor's contest.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her candidacy to Michoacán's governor during the elections of the violent state, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of the crime organized throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, it is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview one day after the Sunday vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they took over the polls, set up barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favour of the PRI.
PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the setting up of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have exceeded Calderón by little, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate from his brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the position of governor, remained third, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates abandoned local nominations for fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as the Michoacán elections appear, a victory will help drive the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, towards next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director-general of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two largest growth economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic block either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observing Europe's difficulties in a "impartial" way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
Over the last few days, Italy's debt costs have been dangerously fired and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased the fears that it can push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to join in helping the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater bargaining power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital revenues.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when facing their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor of Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the two billion people in India, of which up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not turn out well," he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain the many well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in poorly managed jobs, and generating losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens with "important chain effects" throughout Asia.
The forecast of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 percent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces the "risks at the bottom" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that the vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant outflows of capital from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defence cuts
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, warmed the Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a financial in-chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to Afghanistan's battlefields, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already dictating the $450 billion of reductions over the next decade, but now fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that can be imminent if Congress is not able to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "security", would give rise to 23 percent of global reductions and a high on many new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible to execute - three-quarters of a boat or a building cannot be purchased - and seriously harm further modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to withdraw many of our civil servants unintentionally and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would break the faith with those who keep our army and seriously damage good disposition."
The cuts over time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"Although the funding for wartime in offshore contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war would be adversely affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of the war-supporting contract."
"The payroll staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defence.
"The result of a kidnapping in the Department of Defence would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly opposed to this draconian action," Senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result with which one can live, and certainly it is not one that we should impose upon ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of United States national security, and should not be allowed to happen."
If Panetta's letter and recent senators' warnings increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, despite having come to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morals, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries."
"In fact, he invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions " generates significant operational risks: delay in the time of response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed worldwide; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defence projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the wet.
Detaining the development and additional F35 tests could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say that it is the next vital step in improving and addressing potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses of lying to the other.
The administrators of Pennsylvania State University have been accused of perjury for allegedly concealing reports that said a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolás Sarkozy was "picked up" with an open microphone telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Liar has destroyed race and convulsed countries.
The congressman for New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the ridiculous with his disbelievings quickly rebutted by irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with infringements in the financing of the campaign related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who would live it will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton's hearted by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps are widely spread in school and university exams.
There have been cases where teachers have given the answers of the examinations to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the contrary are sending the message that lying and deception are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies," is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge would be based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades in prestigious universities that carried out research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been repeated.
The liars do look into the eyes.
They don't always stutter, blouse, rub or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are hard to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can reach the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I spent several years exploring scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigate through our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions and knowingly how others perceive them.
We know from the research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented minds", while women say more "oriented towards others" lies -- usually to protect the feelings of someone -- that married people less often lie to their couples than people who are not married (but the lies they often say are "enormous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty when you lie to him.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the habitual behavior of the subject.
This is called creating a basic line.
Helps provide reference points to measure later changes.
Watch the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristic.
I'd better know if someone usually beats his foot all the time to avoid making unfair accusations when he sees his feet beating in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive, verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Consider these groups of behavior as alarm signals, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their history, can point their feet towards the door, tilt towards a exit, change their posture significantly or exhibit a "post-interview mishaps" -- that exaggerated breath of relief and change of posture once all difficult questions have ended.
The interviewers often falsely show that the interview has ended just to seek that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson laid his paw to the bottom and used the past time as he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, throwing a search of her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a distant language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a hard question in its entirety.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... until I... to understand."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid being victimized by the swindler artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted after the threat of U.S. delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- pissing the unions, while pacifying environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says that it is willing to redirect the project to re-direct it.
TransCanada said on Monday night that the planned pipeline will move out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's director, Alex Pourbax, says that the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the Department of State that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes were studied that would avoid the areas of Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater.
"This is a real path of progress," said Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may separate any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and expressed his full support for them.
The pipeline, 1,700 kilometres from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, would extend.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to the refineries in Texas.
For that, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to the plan are suspending legislation to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's general inspector had ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada's member of the lobby, Paul Elliot, who was campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A family in New York claims that the diva of disco music, Patti LaBelle, acted like a madman in the lobby of his Manhattan building, landing his little daughter to the point of puking out of fear.
"Lady Marmalade's "Lady Marmalade" diatric scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, so much that he suffered "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "he increased his fear of strangers," says his family at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10th last year when Tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" "I said, "Yes," and I went to pick her up," he said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman that she was angry.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J in loud voice...
He had a bottle of water and began to throw the water out of the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle boasted about the mother -- who was still subject to Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surroundings and removed from a car waiting for her, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so loud that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return the calls to comment on what had happened.
The claim seeks unspecified damage, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and the family plans to give all the money he can get to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is directed to a kindergarten teacher who takes an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated for change, which generated high expectations for progress in the economy, but given the start-of-the-year climate adversity, there is no growth, but there is a deterioration in the main economic development indicators.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the potential of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction in overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of ice-cream damage issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage occurred in 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main crops were vegetables, corn and garbanzo.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since, as from January to March 55 thousand 053 signaloenses were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Economicly Active Population, the rate for the second quarter became 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in number of people cast over 74 thousand unemployed signals, an increase over the first six months of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Smaller liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been taken since public policy.
"What is being seen is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market for the effects of a resource restriction by the legislation adopted at the Congress to combat money laundering, already for people who grab dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Organisation
López Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in increasing unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because they already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labour market signoense is aggravated by considering the high level of informality prevailing among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in the state is working without being paid as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour divides is low wages, the entity has the lowest pay in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of signage workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI Contraction
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011, the largest decrease in Direct Foreign Investment over the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June of the State FDI amounted to $630,697, representing a fall of 87.74 per cent over the $5 million 143,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17 thousand 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from third-party enterprises.
The debt
In view of the economic contraction scenario, the State Government in July requested the state congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, even if investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities would be intended to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for a total of 2 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business sector representatives, the first year of government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National House of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really poor, we must work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, failed to align everyone's effort and above all the good progress already synchronized from this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as early-year ice-creams stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including ice creams, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn back fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and so at the end of the year we are closing far below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriahte, president of the Mexican Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he stated that the state is required to engage in productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefine, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be done
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that best addresses the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been trying to achieve good results in various areas, there are some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of driving public policy.
"There are elements that allow to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I believe that the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
They're condemning him for 8 kgs of marijuana.
Five years in prison and 100 days in fines was sentenced to a neighbor of Navolato for the possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted drug addict is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of marijuana possession for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80th post, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The Narcomenudist circulated in a pick up truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and in the copilot seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was made available to the Second District Judge and the sentenced person continues to be in the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
It must contribute for works
The social works envisaged in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or seriously delayed due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk of failure to meet the Government of the State's contributions to which it has a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes is nearly 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the work, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of these programmes is in force.
"It's almost 12 million that touches them and despite the fact that the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they've had to give us a part," he said, "we've started the works and they're very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State failed to meet their respective contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a claim to cover the more than 7 million that did not contribute to the State administration on that occasion.
"We had already gone through the previous sex because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state had left behind," he said.
Despite the State authorities ' commitment to the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to speed up efforts to ensure their respective percentages as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that touches them and despite the fact that the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth."
Corte valid "analogical flag" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional disputes between the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree advancing the so-called "analogical flag" from 2021 to 2015, not bringing together the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court would decide on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this is in force.
The draft judgement, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a statutory power reserved for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the proceedings, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The plenary decided also to dismiss the request put forward by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the President said he did not match the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure the measures for the preparation of the public administration through general rules.
"I do not think that if I did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," he recalled, "the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the federal executive, who has by constitutional mandate, the head of the State.
The substitution of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, and it translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
To postpone the change, I held, would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "to cover economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of State economic leadership, to include a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the authority of the state executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the executive, by issuing the contested decree, which somehow invades the competences of Congress, is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the legislature, ensured.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote-by-vote" account in Michoacán
According to the PEP data the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is just 27 percent, even without counting the votes for 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" count is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data cast by the Pre-Trial Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is just 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that, just a few days ago, just November 9, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As you will recall, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, whenever the State Congress passed the reforms shortly before the legal deadline was completed so that they could enter into force in the current electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication within the time limits set out in the State Official Journal Act, arguing that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state representative "invalided and illegal" to constitutional reforms, even if he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "voting by vote", Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that by the approval of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of the EMI it will be possible to make partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be held on the assumption that: the results of the records do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and calculation in the case of the box or not open to the President thereof; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations in the records.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all ballot boxes may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate who wins the election concerned and who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that postulated the second one of the candidates identified.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the ordinary budget it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is a express request by the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case the electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be noted that in this situation there is the choice of Morelia, where according to the PRIP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.
His last will
Its ashes will be scattered at the Zapalinamé saw, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during the Mondays there were recognitions and a requiem mass.
According to his family, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes were scattered at the Zapalinamé saw.

Felipe Bacio Cortés went very young from the city of Saltillo to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said it was even dizzy in the truck; however, he always tried to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "only in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his family, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: piloting an aircraft.
They give you the last goodbye.

Locate three abandoned corpses on Cadeyta NL's farm
Hours before the finding, the military authority presented to the media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed with bullets in different parts of the body and with the shooting of grace, in an abandoned estate of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finding took place at 1.5 km from the Cadereyta road to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that in the fifth, whose barda is beige color with coffee, was the open gate in pairs.
Looking inwards, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately notified the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals was a yellow dress with a dark mezclilla trousers, without shoes; next to him was another with a white swinger player.
A few meters away was the body of another individual with a red player and blue mezclilla pants.
The three of them were in their mouths.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three persons would have been killed elsewhere, as no shells were found on the site.
Legends are found in the fifth barde, which are directed from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
Captured to 11 in Cadereyta
The National Defence Secretariat introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated primarily in the municipality of Caderyta and those who were associated with kidnappings, homicides, "halcone" and clandestine burials.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of the economic disaster and has put the whole eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected that a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats will be present, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "marco is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the beaten confidence in Italy.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of the Italian patronage Confindustria, said to the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi PDL party, to whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are meant to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the right centre party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocrat majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could result in a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure to warn that a failure in Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started his consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups on Monday, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He'll end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister would succeed.
Redeploying Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process bound by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties is complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The rock of the Spaniards is superior to that of the tics
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten outnumber the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of the 22 calls arrived at the 50 meetings.
A great contrast to that of Costa Rica, if compared to the 22 convened by both countries for today's friendship, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While World and Europe’s champions, number one of FIFA’s monthly rankings, account for a wide record of Class A interselections, the Tricolor only has the defender Michael Umaña as the only one that has the 50 international games.
That figure was reached on Friday in the party against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Great League of England maintain an intense activity year-round in league championships and domestic cup, and high-level shocks in European cups such as Champions League.
The above is added to the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated Eurocopa and the World Cup.
On the contrary, footballers have a limited international rock in an area, such as the Concaaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection is of the archer Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the register of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play before the Tricolor today and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, the Barcelona brain wheel, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the week before by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ariet, Raúl González with 102.
Nearly the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the Tico side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five were over 30 matches: Kelor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albil (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, show Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't close at 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
The historical gorge of Spain is David Villa, with 50 diamonds, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz recorded more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two-year journey tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday, at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band ensures that for them it will also become the dream of playing in the country.
This was assured by the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The grouping is located in the South American wing of its two-decade working tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, beginning at 7:30 p.m., next to the angelic band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, it's a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're gonna be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of band devotion, fans live intensively the days before.
What do they tell their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thanks for having waited so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Can you add that a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We play a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we knew, through people who love surfing.
In view of the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have they planned for their presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and different repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this due to?
I think it's partly because we have nine disks and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have had time to not touch, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting to people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've done?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us can imagine that we would be on a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years it seemed like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are thrilled that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunt?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it's a little unusual.
Every now and then, there's a band in a city, but it's a lot more strange when five or ten bands come out at the same time as one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on her tour, so we are lucky to be friends with them all yet and honor us being part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange that a band like yours will remain united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word of fame has not been simple; yet, thanks to your success, they have been able to do whatever they want.
How do you find a balance sheet?
As we have grown up, it has been easier to find a balance sheet.
We make sure you don't be too busy because it's easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and the people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brought it, without getting encapsulated for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We went on a band for almost three years and never posted a record until after Andy died (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because it would last so long and most importantly we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics always change live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are their influences?
They're so many.
Among the first ones that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunt relevant despite being no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the result of this change?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that might look lighter, but there's also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs though they might sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched me, I cried when I listened to them and they were deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated by the loss of muscle strength in his legs, reported his head doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during her government (1990-2000), suffers from several injuries, including a cancer in the tongue for which she has been operated four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the television channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he did not want it because he knew it innocent.
It was operated four times from cancer to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms that have been combined with other pathologies such as severe erosion gastritis, pancreas cyst, renal calculations, arterial hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Police Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people by a squad of annihilation of the army that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican couple, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proprietary for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations", according to the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the France incident that arose when French deputy Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call to consult his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing since November the G20, a group composed of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the creation of tax exchange agreements in order to exit the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ' grey list ' , formed by countries that did not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004, a Free Trade Treaty (CTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustache fountain passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tireless, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never so far had done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which reaches stores all over the world this month, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS laptop, which allows you to play in three dimensions without wearing glasses.
"Mario is the character that has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support," since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "single" to bind the less skilled users.
Once exceeded, the most experts will be able to make a "second turn" at the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, which was not produced since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo is playing the saga's followers and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, consisting of the fact that the moustache fountain will have to use mined platforms of danger in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom gives way to Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he led to the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy for the washing of US$70 million.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the country in the north, which called for Portillo to judge it there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was guided by the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of judgment had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office "he did not put his hands on" in judicial resolutions and gave proceedings to all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The act by Colom represents an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to prosecute the ex-commissioner from 2000 to 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once it has dissolved its legal situation in Guatemala and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the Q120 million gap in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process before extradition, but the Public Prosecutor appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into marginality of untrained boys
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support institution is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation over this quarter of the century.
This adds to the hundreds of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make a balance in an event held in the old Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, no work, problems of dogradation or in a situation of falling into marginality.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated on a large number of managers of institutions and institutions who have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former socialist education adviser, Ernest Maragall, and the extended mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Richard Gomà.
The current advisor to Welfare Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director-general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also went to the great Fabra and Coats room.
But he said that Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the current one is, too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president set up Trinijove as an example to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Unspoiled an okuda farm where macro-feestas were made
The invaders had taken 11 of the 13 floors of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm on noon yesterday without resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare of the neighbors of the 51st Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday's noon voluntarily the property they were illegally occupying, and where they organized macro-fiestes that desperate the neighborhood, in judicial order and without need of police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from being repeated.
"From now on there will be access control," said the administrator.
The okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the crowds' parties, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for the lodgers.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped 80%.
The owner of the disco points out that the invaders of the farm made him unfair, as they sold the cups to three euros, while at the disco they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had to respond to neighborhood complaints by noise, while, as he pointed out, the nuisances did not provoke the customers of the club, but the inhabitants of the okupada house and, above all, the participants to the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbours of the area.
The manager of the disco explained that the disturbances were so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago he "forgives him" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks she had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group at the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week to "displace the building immediately to end the problems of coexistence and civilism that produce the neighbours, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant in the occupied building, but over the last few months the okupas had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some of them there have been thefts.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and to be powerful against the incivisism that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the Moss took away a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police headed to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested at the moment.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the opportunity of calling beyond controversy about fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 1980s, in full apoge of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional pastries of Collserola.
The brochure defines the mountain as the large park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was once again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (mar).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalis in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these were until, in September, the town council convened a megacompetition composed of 16 contests for so many other access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, no doubt.
Or that or someone wants to put doors to the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational twist and for what it implies of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring subject to which to shake hands when two members of this old caste of elect are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact stands, precisely, for one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and university professors think they have introduced themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modól and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coast front "it becomes necessary" to debate on "the mountain front", whenever Ildefons Cerdà's speech, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It can be from the basis that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect for whom the title "gates of Collserola" closes a "lexic trap": not to think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where to act".
Modern, such as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal of "intellectual net" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "intimate that is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and which had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
"Limiting something is already setting the next step," that is, your overstep.
"There is a need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [with reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can give rise to real disasters."
More concerned with the question, Modól is of the view that, by simplifying, the veritable valleys of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographical question.
Model recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "should not fall into a broken bag", although he appreciates the opportunity that the town hall offers to his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile is the one that must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all achievable", points) that have had to be created: "The architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest there is a global view of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional contests have been convened -dice - in the sense mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the door next door.
In his view, the town hall should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonah Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal takeover of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process followed by alleged blackmails
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the Casino Red's legal officer granted him forgiveness to the District Second Criminal Judge, who continues a blackmailing process against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack at the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay for an economic fee so that the town hall would allow the underground operation of the betting house.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the papaya mayor and on 2 September was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Officer 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arranigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
This place remained for 49 days after it was issued a second order of root after the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had desecrated crimes of cohesiveness and organized crime.
On 19 October he was allegedly taken to the Cadereyta prison for blackmailing with one and a half million pesos to the owners of the Casino Red; however, he remained only a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October he was ordered to arrest the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that almost two months of investigations were found sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of the latter.
This Monday, the legal takeover of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, went to Judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the mayor; so in the next few hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Officer, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the associates of the gambling house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the 197/2011 file, the legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and, subsequently, no claim may be filed concerning the process followed; in addition, no compensation will be required for damage or punishment.
After the hearing of the legal officer of the betting house, the immediate freedom of Larrazababal Breton was ordered about 15:50.
The Secretary of the Judge, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
He will also notify him of the order of immediate liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysius Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident where he lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven more people.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, lost his life, and seven others, indicate that the helicopter directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysius Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were the right ones to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the aspas had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that investigations into the impact area do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search there are reports that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to carry the passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it was a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, research can last several months, even to reach a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the Helicopter of the Presidential Major State was operating at cruise speed and that this happened on a soft terrain uphill.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical normativeity, the flight was conducted under the visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must be visible during the flight and the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports at the ICMA found appropriate conditions for taking off, as the aircraft moves towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico, with layers of low-level cloudiness.
Selected paths:
Due to cloud conditions, the crew is likely to have sought a lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of parts of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and side-by-side path.
The aircraft residue scatter pattern allows the helicopter to be assumed to have been impacted on the ground in structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion detected:
On the site of the sinister remains undiscovered in the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the middle level of the sea, and the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was expected to disassemble during this tour.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a larger area than the agreed site around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact was presented in structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find gene obesity
Leads Social Security an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; is supported by NPI specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents' protocol, which will enable them to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Specialties Hospital of the National Medical Centre Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Advanced Research and Studies Centre (Cinvesav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate in the population whether or not they are entitled to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Mexico Valley, where the tests are carried out for minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Ponent Mexico State) and that since 8 October, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (East Mexico State).
Once the objective of meeting 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify in children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day, he stated that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, to implement specific food questionnaires.
You will also be asked about the physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger such diseases as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that on Saturdays all participants are applied anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and insulin and genetics (the aim is to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research is based on the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys noted that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of children, of 77 percent in obesity, and in the case of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic increase was also observed,' highlighted the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others in their genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics translates into the inability to burn the excess of energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in fat form.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the integral evaluation of children, which allows them to detect if they present any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) on the neck and forearm, which indicate the probability of metabolic and even prediabetes alterations.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it in writing to parents, who are told each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that they must make in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic sufferings: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugared beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, et cetera) with high fat and protein content and the genetics that are analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would prevent berries
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemicals Faculty, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the floor were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 basins each rain season in the Mexican Valley Metropolitan Zone, warned Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher at the UNAM's Faculty of Chemicals (FQ), who assured that if the construction and maintenance process of an asphalt floor is the right one, the berries could be reduced in quantity or even completely eliminated.
At his conference A technological opinion of the berries, dictated within the framework of the International Year of Chemicals, revealed that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to that of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believed that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north, to improve its performance and hence the formation of berries.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some high molecular weight, called asphalts, and others low molecular weight, called maltens, which together give to the floor their characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists of that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrades has a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is being modified during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, warned the expert in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve the asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, pointed, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, it allows forces to spread very well on the floor.
If it were to be modified asphalt, the chemical engineer felt it would be even better.
On the asphalt folder, abounded, a last layer called tread folder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, an sand that also bathes in asphalt.
As it is about the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the way.
As the part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the treadmill also requires the proper thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor in considering, especially water, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil is wet, the water is diffused inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a reblading of all the layers of the floor and, therefore, the formation of berries.
In the process of forming a bache, he said, the first to wear is the rolling film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of berries and, therefore, the thickness of each of the floor layers should always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, to avoid frequent formation of berries.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already found even on the market and allow easy repair of berries and without needing to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 as a princess.
Once again the Cauca Valley is left with the wishes of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform to being in the winning podium, shining the silver crown and band that believe her as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic lady rose with the crown and the cetro, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of the legion of Vallecacan women who have been near the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1981), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcías Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcia Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people ask is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Lady Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that got queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess is that she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that marked you and why? made by Martin Murillo Gómez of the Literary Cart Leamos.
When interrogating the Vallecacano, he replied:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think the book that marked me as a childhood is "The beginning", it's a pretty deep book.
Today I read "Crimen and Punishment" is a book of universal literature that we all must read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood."
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and second by not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books you quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony, she showed herself to feel calm and happy with the result "The universe is wise to pass what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little bit, "The beginning" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle burned favoritism.
A Bogotano journalist insinuated that, by being the preferred, the ovative and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (the Oster gastronomy net, the vote of the public for the best craftsmanship suit, and Queen Mother), "that woke up the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted in his first performance in bathing costume on the Hilton beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although it was safe in both of them, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum that representatives of Magdalena and the Atlantic did prove.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "As at home" program of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "sees that the candidate who wins most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen".
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very skirmish with the press, and there it was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Competition of Beauty.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their parents.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before entering the Competition are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of its defects in the back and the fibrosis observed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury precisely chose her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The preparation of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth to me was not very notorious, dropped points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos believes that the mistake of the valcaucacana was the surgical interventions that were performed.
"Surgeries are fine, but Valle was not able to do them.
His body was never his strong and here he was charged."
For this award, which for the first time delivered the National Competition of Beauty, after the parade in bathing suit appeared a cruel vaticin that was accomplished last night, because it was said that this was the place that Raymundo gave Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina has since begun a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international struggles for the designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her nagging pass through Cartagena, was denied the crown.
So was the work of the caleño that identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went to history like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th, a lophoscopist of Cali's ITC went to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the chief of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", through his fingerprinting.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the ITC section, that week played the "availability" shift to Eliasar González, a man from Port Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the start of his career, González worked in municipalities of the Chocó, where he often had to enter the jungle for more than five days to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, palms of the hands and feet.
The operating week against Alfonso Cano alias Elizar warned him to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
Friday night he left for the Caucasus on a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected of the man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to carry the decactillary card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was naked, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Elias compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.
His eye failed him: he was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man coming from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was the chief of the Farcs.
Searching for the trace
For a dictator of the Sijín de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliasar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactioscopy is an accurate science, without margin of error, which can become a key to the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of bodies, lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the people captured.
When captured, many delinquents present false ballots or have no papers.
We take the fingerprint print and look it up in the database.
The investigator reported that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, for in that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a strong box full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to take out a fingerprint, but in that case we could get the trace of all the hand and identify the criminal, who had participated in different thefts," she recalled.
Traces may also rule out or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
Recently they found a dead man, with liquor bottles around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, in fact, a trace in the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
An ITC dictiloscopicist explained that in the objects "the traces are taken out with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Register.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said ITC expert.
He made it clear that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches becomes trace.
However, if it can be used, if the respective quota is made.
"Indignants" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part took care of the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupa Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday in an attempt to enter, under the protection of a court order, the Manhattan Square from where they were evicted in the morning and trying to occupy another park of the Great Manzana.
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignant" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a more northern park in the city, where there have been new detentions.
"Our idea is that, if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the square, we're going to install ourselves somewhere else and we'll continue the legal battle to go back to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the "indignified" response to the eviction of his camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to stop some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured Ephesus that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people who had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been moved to support the members of the movement and who has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square, which is a private property building, remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday, where the legality of the evacuation of this morning should be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who had been displaced so far carried and distributed copies of that order and even handed them over to the agents guarding the plaza, which caused "a few small clashes," said Bray, who denounced that some officers had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from leaving the Occupa Wall Street members or applying "laws that were published after the start of the occupation or from prohibiting demonstrators from entering the park again with shops or other properties they used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, because of that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the protesters, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to reinstall themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The director personally defended the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people" because "some businesses had been threatened" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that in the Bloomberg background he is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the movement spokesman, who accused the mayor of "disrespecting freedom of expression".
The officials of "Occupa Wall Street" also indicated that they plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months of the protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television Christmas
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", married to "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television Christmas.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadian prominent, will appear on the television program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appears along with his then-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" battery, Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known comic of Indian origin that recently acted as the presentationer in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appeared as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas has Canadian singer Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and is not unusual to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ended the fall spiral that started in March.
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that has taken place in a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that Japan has suffered since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo accounted for material losses in $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have diminished.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to pass page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at an annualized rate.
The registered in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the resumption of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by seism and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decline of 0.9% in capital expenditures from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted climbs.
However, the real reversive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use the weaknesses to grow from scratch.
Japan has, above all, awakened from the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The tin stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "values shelter" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbid forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a break in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September at the assessment of the yen.
As long as the markets continue to siege the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower the guard.
"We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And, indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member countries presented clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates inflection points in the world economy emphasized that the main powers are being curbed.
As it dropped four tenths to 100,4 points, compared to 100,8 August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, at a precipitation of eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds back the doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to be engrossed in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional Government is more imposed by Brussels' demands than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support further austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Popedimos said when opening yesterday a parliamentary debate which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new executive.
A package with 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the staff disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message leaves no doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his good visa to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still scolded by the impact of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "an unambiguous written commitment and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth stage" of 8,000 million, although there is no final date.
The Greek Madeja still has threads for a while.
Doña Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-wide preponderant place in the role of Microfinance".
The Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the question in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "existence" pointed out that it is a "tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with the horizon of 2015, and, "especially, in those who aim to reduce half the volume of people living with less than one dollar a day, with which the "poverty umbrella" is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility," said Dona Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "enhanced the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many achievements" and "many of the challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for discussion but also as the platform from which to drive "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is expected that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will leave the poverty line they are in.
The momentum in the conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneer form" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuing evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link with this project was worth yesterday the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her intervention by encouraging the present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic goodwill, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that micro-credites assume "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" developed country governments must work on solidarity criteria and not allow it to be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, the microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to people "excluding those who shut the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present to a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the solidarity spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
On the first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially, the agenda had not been included in the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider the government's policy to be too narrow with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with his speeches, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhilus Minister of Finance, clear any doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, are summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe represents peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe."
This could be expressed in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon in order to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission for universal suffrage to "make Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals for the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the European Central Bank Directive on the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce Germany's weight.
Looking forward to calming the spirit within your party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is not that he has tried to win his congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except in the past.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of ill-treatment fraud
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against disease casualties.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15, in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and to give a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the willingness to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most of them want to focus on disease casualties.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day ' s shortage on private sector workers before they can take down.
Finally, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls sick would lose four days of wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise an wave of anger, but which would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on staff a day of non-remuneration in the case of low-work (up to now, they have no shortage, compared to the three days in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority also put on the table the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuse of low labour.
"There will be a considerable increase in controls, and if someone is found to be a fraud, he will have to repay the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned by speaking at RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of low-employment fraud.
In fact, since 2002, there has been a constant follow-up to this issue and a number of political offensives have been launched that have normally produced fruit.
The French do not add up more than in the rest of Europe.
Let us pay attention, first of all, to national figures.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), in 2006 more than €237 million was paid in unemployment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, low-income subsidies accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008 and amounted to EUR 11.300 million.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54% is related to sickness benefits, which amount to €6,200 million.
Therefore, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of the Sickness Insurance, indicates that in 2010 37 per cent of disease casualties were less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to catch low by disease.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS investigators indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence of work (both for health and other reasons) in France ranged between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness casualties are not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has quite a limited scope.
The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic monitoring of disease casualties over 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 realized, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11 per cent of the cases were "adequately adapted or unjustifiable; a figure which, with a total of 1.2 million as a starting point, amounts to 132.000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who have taken a sick leave.
No doubt, a small figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to the MP of UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent tax revenue losses of between 9,000 and 15 billion euros per year, that is, more than the total cost of downs and, of course, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This was stated on Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament; he added that the hundred days that have been granted to his union Government would not suffice to achieve that goal.
"In order to make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who gave his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, since "the country's stay in the euro area is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papadémos has foreseen that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to about 9 per cent" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed on Monday his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit itself to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with Members of his party "New Democracy".
He noted that he was in agreement with the deficit and debt reduction objectives, as well as the fight against defeat, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
The European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr Olli Rehn, warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of EUR 8 billion needed without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras has answered that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
An expert committee claims that euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized
Canadians live denying death, as indicated in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they wish to die and make provision for that.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from a variety of areas, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way that assisted suicide and euthanasia are permitted, when the patient is given such an option and has been tried for the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada occupies the tenth position, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the subject of death."
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, as indicated by the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Together, the highest rate in this sense is recorded by Quebec, where 86% of the deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive subject of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that they do not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or are not criminal offences, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted with persons not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide, although clearly illegal, is practiced," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadian Supporters for Euthanasia
Let us recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, since they are of the opinion that it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66 per cent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled persons are less valuable.
As for persons who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a trial should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, as the authors of the report indicate.
Furthermore, among its recommendations, it is suggested in the Criminal Code that withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canada's health institutions, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it is considered euthanasia and is subject to the same procedures.
Other experts demonstrate reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has described as "extreme" the position of experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill people.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and who is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deschamps, who yesterday consulted a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Now, add that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which called "a demonstration for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, particularly calls into question the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus denounces a plot
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bachar El Asad spoke yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Bachar El Asad's Syria was intensified, which, with Russia's support, resists and denounces that there is a "comple" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened the sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have expressed their support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdalá II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader who asked President Bachar El Asad to "drop on power" in Syria, where 40 civilians and members of the regime forces have already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts carried out by Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with respect to which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
Following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime has been strengthened.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesman of the State Department.
In the meantime, 16 civilians have already lost their lives and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the Deraa region, in southern Syria, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in Homs's besieged city, as indicated by that NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Mualem, considered the country to be "progress towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has reacted firmly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which in his opinion constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not fail," he added, ensuring that "the plots framed against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, from the military media and observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his view, is locked in the "paranoia".
It is expected that a new extraordinary meeting of the League will be held in Rabat tomorrow to develop the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which will, in particular, involve the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detainees.
Russian Foreign Minister Serguei Lavrov has yesterday judged the Arab League ' s decision as " incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested some time on the markets to train his team and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" to recover the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today met with the unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted office, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the designated Council.
For its part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence to Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt from a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In the "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its programme, he pointed out, adding that it is "sure that the markets will be patient and will understand it."
His appointment by the President initially received market approval, but the concern was later imposed, in particular following an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should set up a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "political".
The new Government will have to function until 2013, the date of the next legislation, it considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti is committed to working, when he is in charge, taking into account the urgency and with the aim of Italy 'recovering its role' in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn has pointed out that "even with a new government, it will not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigour measures.
The Italian "chief of chiefs" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the math, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "as a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competence and his independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some EUR 200,000 million in state obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to an American NGO specializing in atomic risk on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that agency of the United Nations.
The IAEA last week expressed its "severe concern" for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since 1960, at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Oral, and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamants" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have brought him into contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Subsequently, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique but also, according to a Member State to the Agency, worked during most of his career in this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, as reported by the statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a rise of 13 per cent in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews, and an overall increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, as the FBI indicates.
"After a decline in 2009, it was worrying that these crimes and crimes had been re-increased," said the human rights organization Human Rights First, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added an organization leader, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses," he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site changed on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" tab enables you to follow the activity of other "Twittos", that is, of those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or follow you.
This allows you to know if you follow messages, if you subscribe to new accounts, if you qualify as a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, according to the AFP, Twitter's spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its unintended operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward another person's message, follow-friday to recommend following another user) making the initiates happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the major public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have debated "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me follow some elements of my Twitter stream better," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Democratic Coalition in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budgetary "gold rule" to reduce the public deficit and thereby prevent a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure far above the maximum limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay EUR 3. billion more in interest every year," said Christian Democratic Vice Chancellor Michael Spindelegger.
Austria responded to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or an equivalent law.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government approaches the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt that type of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the federal government's structural deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, while the regional States, as well as the communes, should submit balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 60 per cent as set out in the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
A strong yen
Noda threatens a new intervention of the exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the marking of change if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we check that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historical peaks that led to the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massively full dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been slowly going up since then, driven by the purchases of investors who regard it as a "refugeal value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has recosted on Tuesday less than 77 yen and the euro has descended below the 105 yen symbolic bar, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted at about 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago, since it increases the Made products in Japan and reduces the value of the revenues obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they become the national currency.
"Japan is fighting to rebuild itself" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), noted Noda, who fears that the growth of the yen root cut the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in one year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect the “economic foundations of Japan”.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), to open a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had already taken "the right measures", suggesting that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the Emission Institute increased by five billion yen (EUR 47,000 million) its purchases of Treasury Letters, bringing to the 55 billion yen (519 billion) the threshold of the funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the guys grow, the bags flaque
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis continues to affect European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of weaker countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European exchanges sink a little further in the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 hours, ACC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and in London 0.1%.
"In view of the new tensions with regard to the yields of loans from the euro area's most affected States, the world's trading markets continue to be part of their recent profits."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional runner at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market players regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look in Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a margin of small variations, so that investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized," Mitsushige Akino considers, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which is still falling on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 hours, the European currency was $1,3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after the Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that envisaged, in particular, the option that a country in difficulty would leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types are more than 6%
The credit rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of the 10-year-old Italian obligations reached 6.85 per cent, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has taken time to markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "principal work" of his Government.
Spain is at the market point of view, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in types ("spread") between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the 0.3% envisaged, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has reviewed the figure of the second quarter, with a reduction of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really concerns economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are planned at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with considering short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate for an election meeting to be a time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, there will have to be a growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case with Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or with Switzerland, which only aims to build last-generation power stations.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, by citing some examples, continue to be determined by their projects.
The United States, on the other hand, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resumed the construction of a power station interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality runs counter to such discourse.
The choice of Berlin will mean a rise in the price of electricity, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, harmful effects will be noted.
It must be taken into account in the case of Denmark.
Europe's champion in the wind sector, of which 30% of its electricity is obtained, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to wind interference; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would entail a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the wonderful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not show opposition by principle to this type of energy, as the surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 head jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs that specialize in international markets and can create non-movable jobs.
If France decided to give up nuclear power, it would entail the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of the 6 billion euros per year in French nuclear equipment and services exports.
What electrician would charge an EPR designed to run sixty years, when your manufacturer's collapse is expected?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miracle source of electricity production, as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a Security Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamenville.
Our highly professional teams are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not cause consequences either to people or to the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two unprecedented natural catastrophes, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as the previous two did.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting these phenomena.
As they study all electrical actors who want to build a power station, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation in our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from a variety of points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the statistics policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "the country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have jumped the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) proclaiming from the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waitresses".
However, economic analysis is rarely considered.
The point is that, on this subject, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by stating in 1976 that "900.000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million migrant workers", while on the left, the tone set it Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the problem of migration.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration undermines growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly low-skilled workers, with pressure to reduce their wages.
However, experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive influence on the wages and employment of the nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows represents a rise in the long-term real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches 30 years of age will make a net contribution (increased costs) of EUR 150,000 to average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that were missing "with his teeth."
These teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it is only necessary to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, during the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the crowns in Greece.
Some may have thought that, in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and as directly as possible.
We know, from Napoleon, "the Little One," that was about something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough alone and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum in this regard had a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruousness.
It must be reflected on this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now been displaced and that in many cases Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a high in the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take action, but a common exercise, of full right, quiet and continuous, from choices and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that bends the orders of markets and rating agencies, which suffer their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty regains the momentum of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investments.
The exit of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, except in order to lead us to disaster.
After having fought this Socialist and Jacques Delors proposal for a long time, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
That's it.
But thinking of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead end.
We must assume a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution motivated by interest would not be sufficient.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
Only a more democratic Europe can be achieved at the political level, a real European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let's make Europeans.
"No contact" chip cards are generalized
The world’s chip card lounge begins on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to estimates by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transportation or purchases by simply approaching the card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its contribution should continue to increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has been a long way back with regard to the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the open-source payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards this year without contact.
To get the top gear, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"There are two major French establishments that have committed themselves to spreading systematically in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the system without contact," says Gérard Nebouy, director general of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which are essential for making transactions.
"They're turning back."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones will be equipped with about 200 customers and collaborators with a fund that allows the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Corporation has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact via their mobile phone.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is increasing
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, on which it had long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the reports of intelligence services demonstrate that they are cooperating," he explained, without further details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January would have resumed the passengers.
Kidnapped at a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delors died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the wake of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study of calls indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a northern city of Nigeria, the cogna de Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, supposedly, is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It is progress, but we must certainly wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had become increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and discourses or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and of the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as a community of enlightened little interest.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), it encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing a rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect from the sharia, while its militants are engaged in the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter focus primarily on churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and the attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as it usually happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and recorded 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested alive, is killed in prison.
Since then, the sect radicalizes and abandons its northern feuds.
Christmas has claimed an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular against the police-protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of these.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became its first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover all security specialists from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Shebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican candidates to the Presidency
With regard to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidents, voters might think so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more strong statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, on China, Iran, are extended to help Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for the designation of the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "by manipulating their currency", a key theme in a America that is desperate for the migration of entire fragments of its sector into Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that "fabulous" emotions.
He asked for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who remains stagnant in the depths of the probes, remains unheard of.
As Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I go out elected, I'll stop Iran," he bragged.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed his obligations with respect to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows on his part a shameful ignorance of such themes.
Recently, she was urging against the Chinese military threat because Beijing "tried to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Tejan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, for his part, he is willing to deploy the U.S. army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also called for by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy burden on foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the plunger in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their ingenious dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of Iraq's "boys" and on its tremors in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks don't turn out to be simple.
The population judged Obama's national security balance more positively, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he disagrees with military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that it takes economic reconstruction of America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The North Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a big pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Filon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas will reach Western Europe each year through a first 1,224 km to communicate the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed at the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, that is, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, we are talking about the possibility of building a third tube by the same route.
For Gazprom, the finalization in time of this enormous work presents areas of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land flow by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening it by closing its access to the markets in Western Europe.
At the highlight of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe of energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to make its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that unites us organicly," said François Fillon during the gas pipeline opening, demonstrating to what extent the major gas sector contracts are as political as economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the Gazprom managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against ship anchorages.
It is located at the bottom of the sea, about 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines from World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, by caution," says Jens Müller, spokesman of North Stream society.
The protection measures for fauna and flora were also extremely necessary.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A monitoring platform was planned in Sweden's waters, but the project's leaders resigned from it when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be established permanently in the sea off its coasts.
"In case you find out, we'll interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, gas pipeline gas will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders find it unlikely that a flight will occur, since they have planned joints that, according to the forecasts, will be run every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by a underwater robot, carried out by a ship, carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
With the form of a pure, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full travel days at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without need of any repair.
Gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which has 51% of the stakes.
She was joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to that company, for a period of twenty-five years renewable, all the gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been brought to an end by 30% with the contributions of shareholders and by 70% with bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach EUR 7.400 million for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure they will not get over their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of expenditure.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Some valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
The total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand name.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people taste for writing.
It has an adventure air, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by the time.
However, Moleskine's notebooks with the present aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian Fashion company, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a book of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company consultant, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book is inspired by an old production technique, the soft skin (top leather), which refers to a cotton-garnished which was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, up to a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first few years has remained far away, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, as the notebook attracts both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with Moleskine's development: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists expose their own notebook.
In August he also launched a notebook with leopard tapas, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer foundations... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in the autumn of 2006, Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of the disabled are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled persons doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Disabling?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress that has been achieved for fifteen years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high as the average.
"But there's still a lot to do."
It is worth mentioning that disabled people continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37 per cent is over 50 (an average 17 per cent).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent have not finished the bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the question of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of people progresses, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge about low disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people on wheelchairs, physical or intellectual".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% disabled workers, which was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest figures available in 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6 per cent.
"Now we reach around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with this law.
The test: the number of establishment "subject to this contribution" as well as the amounts disbursed, has decreased from 2007 to 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, particularly among the large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees on their staff, compared with 82 per cent of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that generates this friendly party.
We would not dare to say that there was conniving between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the outskirts of the Stade de France audience, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have actually made the peace.
Five months after the gesture of resentment from his front against Turkey, the Belgian selector has no more than praise for him.
"I am very glad for Eden, for its progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's front responds.
As for the contrast between your presentations on your team and the selection, "is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this party against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brillar".
Not to mention the pleasure.
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
This will certainly strengthen the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because you will face "the Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," she recalls.
"We just got off the line recently.
"To play against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has referred to pride on his part.
"Ugullo" for playing "a gala party."
"Orgull" also by checking, as "neighbour" that France "returns to being a very high-level team", about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Blues to... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You can see it in the next parties." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento faces with great optimism the return party against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the party of go, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt that the Selection, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the party of go (0-0), on Friday in Zenica hell, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but could not mark the valuable goal that would have given it peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it's a risk, since we haven't marked out of the house."
But at home, at the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal," said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance to participate in the 2012 Eurocopa", however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz has been relativized.
Friday's tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
The Bosnians might get a tie, but they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked out of the house," Bento laments.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality," he added.
Just as in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to exercise, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't give them time to think".
A good idea, whenever, this time, be realistic.
