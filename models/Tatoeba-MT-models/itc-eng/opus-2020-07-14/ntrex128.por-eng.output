Members of the Wales Assembly are afraid to "pass by Marretas"
There is a consternation on the part of some Members of the Wales Assembly (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Parliamentary Members of Wales).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the Assembly's name for "Galish Parliament".
Some members of this House, coming from all political colors, are afraid that this will make them fall into ridicule.
A worker AM said that the group is concerned about the fact that "the designation to row with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Gallese readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrements".
An AM of Plaid said that the group in its globality "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative Member said that the group was of "open mind" with regard to the name amendment, but said that the MWP designation was orally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name amendments, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the House are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave its House powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which recorded widespread support for the proposal to designate the House as the "Galish Parliament".
On the issue of the title of the AM, the Commission favored "Parliamentary Members" or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AM are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring together consensus may constitute a headache for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to how the House operates, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the committee system.
When discussing legislation, the AM will have the final word on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer to the change of country name
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change of their country's name to "the Republic of Macedonia of the North".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decade conflict with neighbouring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a complaint about its territory, repeatedly objecting to its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposition to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no more than the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
Sinos of St. Martin are silent at a time when the churches of Harlem fight for survival
"In a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither one."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
"People socialize differently," he said today.
"The bars have ceased to be the living rooms in the neighborhood where people turn regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned about the possibility of the money I earn with the sale of heritage not to last as long as the leaders expect" and that sooner or later everything will return to the point of departure."
The churches, he added, can be replaced by buildings of apartments with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the shrines of the remaining neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and, therefore, this will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation left in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was then set up by a black congregation that held its worship in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the shopkeepers of 125th Street, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson’s parishioners ordered the trolley.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the "poor's bosom".
The specialist who played the trolley in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and a "unsubstituted historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also reported that he was the world's first trolley to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the largest trolley in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "procurate to transfer its costs", poorly the fact that it had not been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tuberão causes injuries in 13-year-old teenager at a lobster hunting dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunting dive in California, on the first day of the lobster season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, then ending up with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting "I was bitten!"!
I was bitten!
The whole area of the clavicle was dilated, Hammel described what he observed when he got to the boy.
"I screamed all out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to a critical state.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Point Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the United Kingdom cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections in the style of the big stores, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain a share in the UK cosmetics market, assessed in 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow while sales of fashion clothing and items to the home recant, these major cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores scattered by the country and will be implemented in more shops in the coming year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the search by supermarkets for ways to use exposure space previously used for TVs, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its beauty product catalogue with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its range of Boutique makeup so that most products obey the vegan precepts, something more and more required by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London last week. It is expected that the second one, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, opens near the end of the year.
Online shopping and the change of eating habits to small daily quantities in nearby shops have led to supermarkets now need to work harder to persuade customers to visit their shops.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are becoming more and more like large warehouses, at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has come to install Argos sales points in hundreds of shops, also having installed a series of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and states that this has strengthened sales of commodity products and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended up in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s but the relationship ended after a dispute about the distribution of revenues of health products stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy emerges after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its pharmaceutical business with 281 sales points to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores an extended range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the aspect and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our range of brands has been designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby abandoned 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the Star of Dragons Den, became "furious" after the TV presentationer Holly Willoughby abandoned a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of items for home and Truly accessories.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptroew.
This Morning's presenter, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she would abandon the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the Star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones freed by abandoning the lucrative brand in the last minute to focus on his new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furicious" when the golden girl on TV admitted, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business (which could be worth 1.5 million pounds), meant that he would no longer have time to devote to his brand of household items and Truly accessories.
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Pltorow and expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones would catch an airplane for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: "Truly was by far the greatest of Holly's priorities.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long term and would be a financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave has left everyone absolutely astonished.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of articles ready to sell at Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that the release of the presenter of This Morning, who is among Britain's most lucrative stars, can cost the company millions, given the extensive investment in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household articles, and the potential for further delays in the launch.
In addition, it may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the project as president in March.
Couples make vacations together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity program host for ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business."
"And then we fell in love"
The US president joyfully mentioned the criticism that it would be the target of the media by making a comment that some would consider "indignified by a president" and by revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in at once?
Trump said, in his fake voice of "telejournal pen".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He said that Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, highlighting that it would be a great step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
However, the negotiations for denuclearisation are under way.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a " corresponding response " from the US to the first steps to disarm North Korea.
Instead, he said, the US continues with sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in his speech at the beginning.
"He's running very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
Trump stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of the U.S. military.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when he spoke in relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this superflated arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd directly ahead of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia causes devastation on an island, causing hundreds of deaths
In the heat of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was said to the foreign non-governmental organizations that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international aid channeling.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was clear that they are not asking for international help; therefore, it becomes a little difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether it would be permitted for international agencies to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant tremors of land suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill prepared for the wraths of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, shelters against tsunamis are not commonly seen in other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a series of tsunami alarm in Palu, a bad degree of the existence of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, travelling among the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship parked in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the place of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made the improvement of the infrastructure decrepita a central part of his electoral campaign, spent huge amounts on roads and railways.
However, the shortage of funding has overshadowed Mr Joko's executive, at a time when he faces his re-election in the coming year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using catacombs, bows, arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Daniel Sturridge do Liverpool makes a long ending for the tie goose goose against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal on the 89th minute on Saturday, Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from the Chelsea ballad, with his team to be lost by 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making a finish towards the second trave.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area by turning to the top right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrzabalaga in flight and fell within the network.
"I was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq advance as much as possible, so I was just earning as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won 1-0 at the interval after marking a goal in the 25th minute, of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this game, the advance of the blues took a heel back to Mateo Kovacic before demarcation near the middle of the camp and performing a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
Then he made a beautiful ending that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the great area.
This went beyond the defenses and made the goal against the network of the second trave with a finish with the left foot that passed through the Alisson Becker network of Liverpool.
Liverpool faces Naples at the league of the Champions on the third afternoon of Wednesday at St Paul Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europe League on the third afternoon of Thursday in London.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia up to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, declared the country's disaster response agency at the beginning of Sunday.
There are reports describing a large number of people imprisoned in the ruins of buildings that developed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached the 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the buildings that were demolished.

The statue of Cromwell of Parliament has become the most recent monument swallowed by the content of "historical revisionism"
His removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for his destruction, which reminds the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's figure next to Westminster Palace became a target to slaughter.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's authorship, is a testimony from the 19th century's opinion and from historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes an entirely precise description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the 17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents one side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration."
Pig killer attacks and plants Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a south-west China market, according to reports from local media.
The man, identified only by his name "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut and covered artery of blood, near a smallpocilga in the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, read on Sunday's South China Morning Post.
The pig grower prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig crop on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, you have traveled with the cousin from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door for an open little neighbor.
In that pucilga, I said, he was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
One forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 kilograms, had attacked the pig until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed, said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed their pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking other people while the police were collecting evidence at the scene of the occurrence.
Reports state that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks have already been reported to humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kild pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal.
After a farm in Oregon had been eaten by their pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as "stimulate".
"They're just kidding.
They like to beautify, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them due respect," he said.
Desquisitions of Hurricane Rosa should bring heavy rain widespread to the south-west of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the entire north of Mexico and to the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
At 5:00 a.m., Eastern Time of Sunday, the rose caused a 137 km/h range, a category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it begins to form a depression over the Pacific Ocean that moves west of the United States. As it approaches the peninsula of Baja California, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity toward the north in the southwest zone of the USA.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that may reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce strong rains widespread in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain may cause sudden dangerous floods, engulfed by debris and possibly land floods in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm precipitation is expected in southwest areas, especially on large part of Arizona.
Sudden floods with rapidly worsening conditions are possible because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly discouraged to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Strong precipitation can cause the passersby to turn into brave rivers and the trovoadas will bring strong, cloudy winds of dust.
The approaching depression will bring with it heavy precipitation on parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm may be possible, which may cause small clumsiness of debris and slippery roads.
This could be the first precipitation of the wet season in the region.
There will be some tropical rains scattered in Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread at the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until fourth.
The month of October can record strong variations in temperature throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools. However, the tropical areas will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
There is an excellent example of drastic temperature differences throughout the central area of the United States on Sunday.
There is a nearly 11 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, in Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern area of the United States will have a hot start of October, with generalized temperatures from 27 to 30 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of the occurrence of temperatures above average in the eastern US by the end of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people attended the Brett Kavanaugh audience
More than 20 million people attended six television stations yesterday to the rapist testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and of the woman who accused him of allegedly sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute revolution: an agreement developed by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh beat her as a drunk and tried to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, stated that he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, the number established by Nielsen on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of spectators in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of other stations, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulties in measuring hearings from those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, it is a level of audiences similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the audience that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
ABC was seconded to 3.26 million spectators.
They then come to CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, referred to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was captured by the chambers of CNN and CBS on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters when he tried to enter an elevator to attend a hearing of the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained motionless to look on the ground while he was directly criticized for CNN's cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake said that her office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that she would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event in live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission went to the vote to make the nomination of Kavanaugh continue for a vote in plenary of the Senate.
However, Flake said that she would only do it in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee during the next week, which the Democratic minority had come to demand.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "doing politics" with Brexit
The Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of his plans to leave the European Union of "politicising" with the future of Great Britain and of undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack with what is known as the "Checkers Plan" of the Minister for Brexit, claiming that a proposal that provides that Britain and the EU cover the other party's rates is "totally absurd".
Murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson of LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect from Sims' deadly shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and charged with murder in second grade, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered them at the scene of the occurrence and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had fatally hit Wayde with a firearm.
A bail amounting to $350,000 has been established, the lawyer said.
The police station at the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head extending to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the authorities in the area for their "deligence and effort to obtain justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
This advanced one, at a height of 1,98 m, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 highlights per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devasted" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"This is what concerns us in permanence," said Wade.
Vulcan eject ashes in Mexico City
Ashs emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after a resume of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in a 24-hour space.
The center detected numerous deaf and trembling noises.
Images on social networks showed fine layers of ashes covering the para-brisas of automobiles in neighborhoods of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysicals have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometres from the capital, since a magnitude earthquake 7.1 shook the central zone of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Confrontations between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protesters and intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, locked by intervention police, hit it with eggs and threw ink in powder, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which the police resorted to sticks to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups singing "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist demonstrators, who shouted "Long life to Spain".
Fourteen people have received treatment of mild injuries suffered in the protests, can be read in the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October that was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence overwhelmingly, although the influx to the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those who are against.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the ongoing vote on voting tables scattered over the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
The independent groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although performed, this manifestation was forced to take a different path.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we lived our best moments.
I saw my parents cry joyfully for voting, but now we are blocked," he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangible victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independent parties have had difficulties in maintaining the momentum this year, with their leaders most known in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting judgment for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his cell phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for trial since last year, announced that he would apply for the European Parliament in the next year's elections.
"Representing myself as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: arrested men after car crashing against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car struck repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there were damage in the gates and in the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may also have shot a beast against the car.
Menga's attack gives a 1-0 victory to Livingston against Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston secured the victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, scared the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as a technician at the Hebox club.
The attack by Dolly Menga made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changed levels, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which continues without a win out of the house in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders, with eight more points, on the next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
However, Livingston has extended to six games its succession of undefeated confrontations in the division, with Principal Coach Holt without losing a single time since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against disturbed visitors
Holt's team should have moved forward on the marker long before the goal, because the incisive character of his game was causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson entered the defense, but he got dragged in front of the ball and then Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his effort away after he sneaked to find Craig Halkett's head over the ball.
The house team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause trouble to visitors in the ball games stop.
And that's how the crucial goal came to be.
The Rangers granted a free pass and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, which gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At that point, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced a defense of the impenetrable house crew, and the Liam Kelly network guard didn't have great problems.
This pattern continued in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers' network guard Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another Livingston ball game stop.
They continued to come crossings to the large Livingston area, which were successively resolved, and two claims of great penalty, one after Halkett's investment on the Glenn Middleton substitute and another after one hand, were refused by the arbitrator.
Livingston "fenomale" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to overcome the expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His style of play and staff have changed little since his return to the great teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt by the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, getting an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving their maximum throughout the game.
Anyway, Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team was far below these standards.
His final play was uninspired (just once they were able to open the team of the house), constituting a kind of warning to the Rangers, which lies in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambigually in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, whose objective was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside its own country.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters marked their presence in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, have also been heard, condemning both the President's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies on a collision with a car
A cyclist died on a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, close to 10:15 a.m., British summer time.
The driver stopped and an interview relief team, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This collision takes place months after the death of another cyclist on an escape collision at Childers Street, about a kilometer and a half of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform his family.
Barriers and deviations were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Wounded in Disorders
Six prison officers were injured in disturbances in a high-security male prison, said the Prison Office.
The disturbances, which still continue, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30 a.m., British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" have been called to resolve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to a wing.
The agents received treatment of small facial injuries on site.
A spokesperson for the Prison Services said: "Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and must make it clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disorder in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threat Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the areas affected by drought may benefit)
A tropical depression is rare to reach Arizona, but it is exactly what is expected for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane crosses the Southeast Desert, involving the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday, to the south and eastern areas of Nevada, to the south of California and to Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that the Rose will take a direct trajectory on Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching at the end of Monday with rains.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression in a radius of 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from Arizona border".
The most recent models of the National Center of Hurricanes predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, can receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of total isolates that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa may constitute a blessing, because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most serious category," said the siteweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the continental mass through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected that it will reach the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Strong precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"The total precipitation is expected from 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with maximum possible 25 mm," the site reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of rose or its waste is the very high precipitation at Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and in the southwest US Desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce sudden floods of debris in the deserts, at risk of life, and floods in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected homicide after a 16-year-old boy who was found with cutting gun wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, close to 4:00 p.m., British summer time on Saturday.
It was transported to the hospital, where it remains "stable".
During the night they were arrested a 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area, reported to the police at Avon and Somerset.
Agents have appealed to everyone who can have mobile footage of the successful one.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was the victim of malice and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for rejection of the implacable and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a concert in Wheeling in Western Virginia.
Trump reported that Kavanaugh "was a victim of malice and anger" of the Democratic party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, having strongly and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and courage" on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum," he said to the crowd of supporters of Western Virginia.
The president referred laterally to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of republican influx to the polls in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, the CNN stated to a principal deputy head of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people killed in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them swept away by the giant waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, communicated the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high struck the beach at sunset, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred following an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of the success," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman to reduce the effect of the Indonesian catastrophes (BNPB) in a communication in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't move alone: it dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and slaughtered bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be rocked by replicas on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Indonesia's Technology (BPPT) reported in a statement that energy released by the enormous wave of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, read in the declaration.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels broke down.
There were found bodies of some prisoners under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and the damage can be deeper along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dogalea, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally incapacitated and there was no information" about Dogelia, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities claimed that the waves appeared at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film released on social networks, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for people on the street below.
In a space of minutes, a water wall fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm immediately the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power cut that interrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with help from Jacarta and other cities. However, the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo visited the evacuation centers of Palau on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia increases exponentially to over 800.
It's very bad.
Although he managed to get safely to the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, the personnel of the World Vision of Domgala went through scenes of devastation on their way, said Mr Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the aid groups began to undertake the grim tasks of assistance to the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and foreign personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared as "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still in a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arrani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"The way the government says "OK, this is a national catastrophe" we can open the doors to international assistance, but this status does not yet exist."
On the fall of the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the still missing still kept the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigate the dark blankets of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been stuck in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing sportsmen for the Asian Games, completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandage, were his students.
"As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon reported that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, they had started to travel between the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during automatic cash refuelling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's official who was replenishing an automatic box in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was emptying an automatic box in the fun complex and preparing to introduce more money, reports Detective Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While I was busy, another man came up to run behind Brink's official and stole a bag of money that was destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the site, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police through number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name--to Ye.
When announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former being known by Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, received none of Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation in Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled it by "emotional reasons", informed the creator of the show.
Being at the same time an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has for it a religious meaning, according to West.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, when he commented on the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"Therefore, I am you, I am us, it is us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the only one", to only Ye - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is another reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers that have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO commits not to resort to military attacks against civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador committed not to use military force against civilians, at a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Military fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have risen to 300, when left-wing student movements settled throughout Latin America.
López Obrador undertook to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open up more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities drag young people to gangs of criminals.
US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
At a time when China strengthens its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the research costs in this field, said the investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments occur after several U.S. government departments have made AI-related announcements, although the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the subject.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in AI until 2030.
"Duplicate the research budget in AI would be a good start, since all other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new revolution in AI," Lee said.
Duplicate funding may double the chances of the next great success of AI being achieved by the United States, referred to Lee to NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the best-classed American player in Othello. He later performed executive functions in Microsoft Research and was president of Google’s branch in China.
Lee gave credit to the previous U.S. government technological contests such as the Robotics Challenge of the Department of Defense Agency for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, in order to help identify the upcoming visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a great effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired luminaries from universities to work in AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to give impetus to its efforts in the field of AI.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to doctors in AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Chinese Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to finance researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is inferior in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which aims to involve partners in industry and the academic environment, and the White House announced the formation of the restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion on an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per annum in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that wanted to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence did not move forward months ago.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to "the Republic of Macedonia of the North", an initiative that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece that blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which forms part of a province called Macedonia, insists that its neighbour's name north represents a complaint about its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but the nationalist opponents argued that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the voter turnout would be sufficient to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum asked: "Is it in favour of entry into NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue admission efforts in bodies with the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Dr. Olivera Georgijska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that it would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The national election committee stated that there were no irregular records until one afternoon.
However, the influx was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
"I have come to vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a capital elector, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of the country's name, which would open the doors for his accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and for the EU, but we want to stick up and not for the service door," said Kavarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don't want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that entry into NATO will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a value lower than the required influx.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia, revealed that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the influx must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major gap in pro-Western government policy since it took possession of it in May of last year.
See: Sergio Aguero do Manchester City crosses the entire Brighton defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling forgot Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory against Manchester City on Saturday, Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in minute 65.
The advanced Argentinian received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
It was then surrounded by four green shirts.
It ended a defense before neutralizing in the other race within the limits of the great Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced English used its first touch in the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan’s netguard with a straight end to the network.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," said journalist Pep Guardiola, coach of the City.
"We said he'd play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had scored a goal at that moment."
But Sterling gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
That goal was marked at the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball right in Brighton's territory in that game.
He passed over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling toward the second trave.
The advance Sky Blues kicked the ball into the network immediately before sliding out of the field limits.
The city faces Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make it hard for the Rockies to live.
With the Nationals eliminated from the end, there were not many reasons to force another beginning.
However, the ever competitive Scherzer has hopes to enter the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the end for the Rockies, which hold a leadership of a game about the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their title of the first division.
"While we're playing for nothing, at least we can get into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the headline launcher for Sunday, but there are those who say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the releases in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, held a session at the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right player in Washington goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump performs debut in Western Virginia
The president laterally referred to the situation involving his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he mentioned the importance of the Republican influx in the interim elections.
"All we did is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running, and that's why I'm fighting everywhere for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "They're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, they're seeing it happen right now.
And they're determined to regain power by using all the necessary means.
They don't care who they grow with, who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of "resisting and obstructing".
"And they've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, evil, deaf and liars."
The President referred to the name Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, and received soundings from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Have you caused the document to be leaked?
Ha, ha, what?
No, hm no, I, wait, one - that was a body language even bad - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censor me, it wasn't a surprise for me.
At the end of the day, I am the most recent of a number of Labour Members in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been subjected to similar treatment because he has resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar topics for which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East working meeting in the sixth quarter mentioned that "we intend that meetings be inclusive and productive".
For the most part of my eight years as a local labour representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it is no longer the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "more kind and kind" politics has been long forgotten, if ever it has been realized.
It has become increasingly apparent that the different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by the leadership of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to take a turn and assume positions with which he would never agree - whether they were on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there is a stream of insults on social networks that call for "depose", denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I must not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments I have been given tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a bar of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never go back to them.
One of the most disillusioned aspects of politics in this era is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with each motion of "censing" or amendment of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I have received numerous advice over the past two years, urging me to keep my head low, not to be so expressive, and that this would "make everything right" for me.
But that's not why I came to make politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party for 32 years as a student, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my school literally comprehensive in rubble, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who most need it, either as an author or as a minister in government.
I've never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have become somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country goes to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But indeed, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "destination" or political files will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe to be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The Unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late essays somehow sent out the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this incredibly interesting game of Tennent's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only ten without defeat.
In the end, it was a superior defense and a better risk management that made the house team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and continue unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie do Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed the Ayr on the front, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, having Jason Baggot taken advantage of a non-converted essay.
Clima extended the advantage of Ayr with a large penalty, before, immediately before the middle-time, having marked and then converted a solo test to place the marker nos 17-5 to Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose began well the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption was followed due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was transported from maca to the outside and, after the start, Ayr strengthened the leadership with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
The master of Ayr in exercise, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with a non-converted essay of Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure investment.
However, the house team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having knocked down Climo without the ball, in the penalty release, MacPherson placed the ball on the ground behind the maul in progress of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing to the fifth rehearsal of the house team.
Still Game Star ready for a new career in the catering business
Ford Kieran, the Star of Still Game, seems ready to enter the restoration sector after knowing that he has been appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with the long-time comedian partner Greg Hemhill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, which will soon be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craigang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "flowerescent Glasgow restoration business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a landless country, hopes that the court will restore you a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a naval base covered with rope in La Paz.
Public buildings feature a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a lost coastal line for Chile is still alive in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point of decades, since Bolivia is awaiting an International Court of Justice sentence on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the delivery of the TIJ sentence on giant screens scattered by the country, hoping that the Hague court will act in favour of its country's complaint, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election battle in the coming year, also has a lot at stake in the Monday sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," was the president's vote last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will act in favour of Bolivia, and that little would change even if not.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ sentence is delivered only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have hurt it.
"The issue of access to the sea was kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric threatened some Chilean residual good-will, he suggested.
At a time in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"La Bolivia will never deprive of its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must overcome the past."
North Korea claims that there will be no disarmament without the country trusting the United States
North Korea's Foreign Affairs Minister Ri Yong Ho stated that his nation will never spare its nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises they made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments arise when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy in impasse, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri mentioned that it is an "impossible dream" to consider that the continued sanctions and US objection to a statement that puts a final point in the Korean war will ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first significant step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and the US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a widespread skepticism about Pyongyang having really intended to reduce an arsenal that the country probably views as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plan to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion parades in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to extend your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of extravagant and oversized hats to their 2019 spring-summer collections, which shocked the set style in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the pass.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant bege hat adorned with a broad aba similar to a pen that flooded the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included unsweetened melancholys of jewelry, a shaving hat and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in carnival time.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high seam.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue with this immense fashion statement, you're lucky.
The stylistic observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the "La Bomba" trail, the straw hat with a 61 cm aba that has been used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of worship behind the very little practical hat spread through social networks sent another great creation to the passersby: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the model in fact of bath that carried it.
The red bag in a burnt orange color, adorned with raffia fringes and with a white leather glue, was the most prominent piece of the spring-summer collection La Riviera 2019 from Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm waiting to see big hats and beach bags coming to the shops next summer. Since the designer had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The schools independent from Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to obtain the best level of service, both for students and for parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to deepen their studies and access to universities, as well as to the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can enter his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart."
This quote reminds us that we cannot just depend on English when we intend to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of recent exams this year, we found that the languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of utilization of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum A classification.
These data, collected at the 74 schools under the height of the SCIS, demonstrate that 72% of students obtained the maximum score of A in mandarim, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that Scottish independent schools are favoring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and not only.
A survey by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 concluded that 17% of the reasons for employers' difficulty in filling vacancies were for lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, the French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio of 15%.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for children today.
The domain of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children better chances of finding jobs with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important to the United Kingdom by 2020, such as the mandarim or the Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose in independent schools, supported by teaching staff specialized in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the necessary skills for success, whatever the future reserves them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance to the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting's over for fans who want to see LeBron James start in Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Laker Coach, announced that James will participate in the opening game of Sunday's pre-time against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48, said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Laker journalist Mike Trudell published a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training at the beginning of this week, James was questioned about his plans for the calendar of six Lakers games in the pre-time.
"I don't need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's home YouTube time and channel in Western Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a round of campaigning concerts tonight in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled concerts for the next week, which include stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump intends to reinforce the support for the interim elections to be held shortly, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's debut in Western Virginia tonight and how do you watch him online?
Trump's debut in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's home on Western Virginia online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably address the hearings this week to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The confirmation vote provided for in the Senate will be pending for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this stream of concerts is to help the Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to gain some momentum.
In this way, President Trump's campaign stated that these five beginnings next week aim "to give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority that they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is as essential for the President's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the turmoil of the campaign season," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign who gave up quoting, told Reuters.
Marked for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the soon-to-night concert can attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and obtain coverage of the media in the Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits Western Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate of Western Virginia Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the U.S. team demonstrates it has strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of the impetus is a fully invented sport concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where did they say the impetus will come now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now are four, so we're looking at it as a little bit of momentum, I'd say," said Jordan Spieth as he was leaving the camp at the end of the day.
Europe is in benefit, of course, with four points ahead and more twelve at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them achieved three points in four.
Spieth has been deadly from tea to green and is leading by example.
Those Guts of celebration were becoming higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth match an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the match on the 15th produced in a similar shout, that guy who reveals that he still believes that the American team continues in the competition.
"It is only necessary that we concentrate and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That's all the rest of each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, is four in four and cannot go wrong.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning's back.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, it consolidates the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory by the sun in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the speech on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the furball hero this morning, when on team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front of the nyne have cast the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they've never been close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of him.
The fourballs and the foursomes are so fascinating to see closely due to the interactions between the partners, the advice they give or not and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better on the team so far and has acquired a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursome session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the struggle that some, especially in the United States, doubted it had.
Europe with a leadership of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last day of Ryder Cup with a loose advantage after leaving the furballs and foursomes of Saturday matches with a leadership of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to arrive at the four-point classification in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, fighting to preserve the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series for 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two winnings, but they failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sunday 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to earn four points followed when he and Molinari, who received the "Molliwood" number after a sensational weekend, are only the only duet to earn four points in their four opening matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the forballs, they further consolidated the advantage, defeating a powerless Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled during two matches on Saturday, revealed occasional genius accesses, but has already lost 19 of the matches he fought in fourballs and foursomes, and seven followed.
Justin Rose, resting during the forts of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the forsomes, defeating by 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked at world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze to the southwest of Paris, Europe has not always brought the best.
Jordan Spieth, three times winner of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a 2&1 brave victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the forsome, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team invested a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although the Furyk team, who owns the title, only needs to draw to preserve the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "no thinking" to untrusted unilateral disarmament
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions was exacerbating mistrust over the United States and that there was no form of the country unilaterally disregarding its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated to the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant good-will measures" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing centre and the commitment not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"Contently, we see no corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way to proceed to our disarmament first."
Although Ri has recycled North Korean complaints already known about Washington's resistance to a "fassed" approach to denuclearization, within which North Korea would be rewarded as it made gradual steps, its statements appeared to be significant in so far as they do not completely reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to Pyongyang's earlier positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a US President-in-Office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim committed to working towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the war in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to soften the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a consistent manner, opposing itself to the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the US leader in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the party interested in this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this impasse".
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was drastically different from last year's, when he stated to the UN General Assembly that guiding North Korea's rockets towards U.S. territory was inevitable after Mr. President Mau' Trump had called Kim the "man of the rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, filled Kim with praise for her courage to take steps towards disarmament, but stated that there was still much to do and that the sanctions would have to continue until North Korea's denuclearisation.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he did not have a calendar for this, stating that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously until the denuclearisation is complete, final and verifiable."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006, in an attempt to strangle the financing of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and later declared that he would visit Pyongyang again in the month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although then North Korea denounced him for "making demands of gangster.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States "take corresponding measures".
Pompeo stated that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they sought were Trump's security guarantees in Singapore, as well as initiatives aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses that teach them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the machist culture of studying in "direct" impregnated with caffeine.
One professor concluded that students of this university at the top of world ranking often did not have the slightest idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes to be the first of his type in the United States.
The inspiration for the course emerged after having given a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, slippers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to pick up the bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the health effects of smoking option," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "direct doing" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
To ensure that we sleep sufficiently and with quality should be a "secret weapon" of the students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid fattening, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in mode of hunger, constantly making them starved.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to your expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program of studies before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm for the time to go to bed, as to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Golo de Menga overthrows Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another access to sadness outside the house when the attack by Dolly Menga caused Steven Gerrard's disarrayed team a defeat by 1-0 at Livingston Stadium.
The team of Hebox tried to record his first victory in his journey from the 1-0 triumph in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up inflicting Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the collective of the Rangers, uninspired of inspiration, never seemed able to equal.
With Rangers now going down to the sixth position, Livingston climbs up to the third, and just behind Hibernian for the difference of golos.
And there may be even more problems for Rangers after the Calum Spence line attorney has received treatment of a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that exceeded the Ayr in the mid-finals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, used the same eleven Livingston who stole one point from Hearts last week, and has been delighted with the way his well-oiled team suffocated opponents in each game.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have marked it two minutes later, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's ballad, but the middle missed his great opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed to just end up outside in the direction of the second gang.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game at the end of the third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been granted a great penalty to the fourth hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson refused Colombian appeals.
The Rangers got only two ends at the ballistic first part, but the old gatekeeper of the Hebox Liam Kelly had little to worry about the end of Lassana Coulibaly's head and the weak end of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's goal at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, however much it is not due to its tenacity.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle a long-standing Jacobs ball game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple completion.
Gerrard moved in the range, having replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the lateral advance moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the lock.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett performing long-term pass behind the long pass.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow ended up outside the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, again claimed a great penalty when he got emranned in Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: On September 30, 1882, she is now 136 years old and continues to CONTACT ...was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the improbable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like a uranium.

New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kills them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its modification in the laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its modification in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including those of breast, ovary, lung and colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach that involves removing immune cells from patients and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a Trump-supported diatribe, extending a MAGA hat after its appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West went to the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which he praised the President of the United States, Donald Trump, claiming that he would apply for presidential elections in 2020.
After performing his evening song, with the name of Ghost Town, in which a hat "Make America Great" was enlivened, he started a beating against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"How can you like Trump? He's racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have abandoned America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star cut off Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcasted, the scene of West's bravery was published on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to shoot West when he did it.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a little bit on the slopes because of the hat.
"They intimidated me in the backyards.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying that "put my superman coat, because that means nobody tells me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try love."
His comments provoked mobs and the SNL participants appeared to be ashamed, he reported to Variety, having someone from the program told the newspaper: "All the studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with the execution of the song I Love it disguised as Perrier bottle.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "One of our bravest spirits: OBRIGATED BY ENFRENTERS TOURBA".
However, the interview program host Karen Hunter published a tweet saying that West was simply "being what it is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or supporting his "art") who I believe is welcoming and spreading harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming it was now "the being previously known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following the passes of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg also used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known to Prince".
Accusation of attempted homicide after suffocation at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public ministry.
Kit Harington Throne Star attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a farmer like Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasy of HBO, War of Thrones.
However, the actor, aged 31, attacked the stereotype of the machist hero, claiming that such roles on the screen make boys feel that they often have to be hard to respect.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit reported that he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Rose Leslie Tronos War, also 31 years old, admitted that he has a "oughly strong position" on the approach to the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel that they must belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequeles or sequels of the War of the Thrones when the series ended next summer, referring to him that the "fields of battle and the horses" ended.
From November, Kit will participate in a True West edition of Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that considering finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series awarded to Emmys.
The couple gave the knot in June 2018 on the property land of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% leap in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, the health authorities said.
About 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90% of men who had sexual relations with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised since 2003 universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters unraveling information about Republican senators by his collaborator and attacks "dangerous minds" and "theories of conspiracy"
The US Congressman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of your team would have published personal information from three U.S. Senate members on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the accusations were promoted by opinion leaders and "ultrarightite" websites.
"Lives, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the residences of the households and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published the data of a member of Waters staff, reported The Hill.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leaking information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This deception is angered," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not your responsibility, he cannot be angry.
You can't have a challenging position.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
You must reveal calm and serenity."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction with the critique of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by the critics of appearing to be too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will contest Waters' place in the intercalar elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," read in your tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally accountable for all his acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Johnny English Criticism Back to Attack - weak spy movie parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashion to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British taste, and it seems to apply to the new edition in the series of comedy films and action Johnny English, initiated in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-sater on the subject of being so bad the new opportunity to export to the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his blindfolded eyes and an expression excessively elastic, got his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than all, that is a comprehensive comical creation for non-English cinemas.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed with a single note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games 2012.
In addition, his character was originally based on the international mysterious traveler and man whose role Atkinson played on TV ads to Barclaycard, who left the chaos on his track.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approached a helicopter with a medieval armor, with the rotor's legs making a short noise of rail against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially taking into account that the editions of "serious" films such as the 007 and the Impossible Missions now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We have the idea that humor is directed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre misfortunes are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground for consternation of the service agent, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who incarnates a pomposous and conflicting figure, to suffer already a total breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for great flights.
Your secret services advisors inform you that, since all agents in the asset are committed, you will have to get someone out of the reform.
And this person is the untrained Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a chic school, but giving unofficial lessons about how to be an infiltrated spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us an academy of spies in the style of the film "School of Rock".
English is taken quickly to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his suffering auxiliary Bough, role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, a snorting character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the catastrophe in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, role played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the prime minister is being dangerously fascinated by the billionaire charismatic technologies that claim to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd, disastrous acts: disguised as table workers, they light up a magnificent French restaurant, create confusion by penetrating as clandestine in the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English triggers pure anarchy as it tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize itself with the interior of the home of Volta.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but for the nicest and most time-consuming that is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And as in Johnny English's other films, I couldn't stop investigating: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role to do justice to his talent?
Labour disillusioned that they are generating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be weighing a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day work week, but with five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to go through the savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) for the workers, granting them an additional day of strike.
The workers would get a weekend of three days, but keeping the order.
Sources refer to the idea of "adjusting" the party's economic programme, which reorients the country for workers.
The passage to a four-day working week obtained the favorable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official said to The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from day to day, but a four-day work week is an aspiration adjusted to the party's approach to the rebalance of the economy for the worker, as well as the overall strategy of the party for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is currently not favored by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the party said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
The Minister of Finance shadow John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power from the hands of the "faceless directors" and the "speculators" of the basic service companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the entire quota of current water companies shareholders, as the Labour Party may carry out "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell has also confirmed plans to place workers on the board of directors of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which may pay dividends up to £500 each year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation to Kavanaugh can make them or not change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions as to whether the findings could lead to Republican senators withdrawing their support.
In an interview to be held on Sunday, the correspondent of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went to the audience, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this claim appeared, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems unremovable.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive accusation would be necessary," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a list of extremely impressive stars that will work on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in the Great Revoludo do Central Park, not only to attend the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the real goal of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defense group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or any other significant forms that contribute to increasing awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "cliquetivism" - do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who exerted pressure to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to the announcement of commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.2 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, with at least $10 billion of those already disbursed or accrued.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom, bringing together investors and implementers committed to "help children achieve their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote to history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions of pressure on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the site's frequent questions, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It's been a long and crooked way - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, just like the great movements for civil and anti-apartheid rights that precede us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists who will be performing this year's event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furnessss and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use the navy as "blocking" to put a stop to Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary," Washington may resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular where it is the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly south of Europe," he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group entitled "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, referring effectively to them.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "magic of a single trick" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration authorities, including the president himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "unsuited" project of pipeline Nord Stream, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stated that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, aims to double the existing capacity for 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated for economic reasons, and this is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will deeply analyze" the possibility of applying for the presidency in 2020, Senator of Massachusetts said
Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she "will deeply "analyse" the possibility of applying for the presidency to follow the mid-term elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and this includes a woman as the ultimate manager," said The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will look deeply into the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren commented President Donald Trump during the informal debate, stating that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a hard vocal critic of Trump and his appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey carried out on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's own constituents do not believe that it should apply for presidency by 2020.
59% of Massachusetts 'probable' voters said that the senator should not apply, according to the poll of the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
32% give their support to your candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for an old Governor Deval Patrick candidacy, with 38% in favour of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party discussed regarding a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden stated that he would decide officially in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at a Donald Trump concert
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after his appointment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what's going on after he's back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually coming back," said the public at a concert in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "turn a little different, get back stiffened, wondering if there is such respect that his comrades soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman and possession of gun as an alcoholic, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia are giving their support to a legal challenge to a new US policy refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district sent a friendly statement curiae (Friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum applicant who is contesting this policy, referred to NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in Grace vs. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against politics was not revealed.
The person said that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang", abused her, but the U.S. authorities denied his asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The public ministries that supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as nations that face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigrant Resources which allowed immigrants without documents that had escaped domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney-General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle", read the statement amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in this statement that the prohibition by the police of the entry of immigrants negatively affects the US economy, stating that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "available the necessary labour force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," Sessions said on June 11.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all problems, not even all serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of dead doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, mother of a male febrile baby, comforting him in an evacuation center in the razed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything that could be found among their soaked water belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I believe," said Haris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a US daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's payment supplement in Des Moines Register, the newspaper with more stripping of the state of Iowa, after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the 6 November elections to Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was attempting to interfere in the US elections marked the beginning of what the US authorities, in declarations to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting an ever-increasing trade war which has seen both sides apply tariff vacancies on the imports of the other.
China's retail tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump's Republican Party, say Chinese and American specialists.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farmers and American companies.
China has written Branstad in an opinion paper on Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now putting foot in the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertising advertisements in our free press."
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the careful American tradition of freedom of expression and press publishing a paid announcement at Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"In contrast, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have of the worrying economic trajectory of their country, because the media are under firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters before the intercalar elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend the appointment of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this may trigger a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the mid-term elections to take place shortly.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have said publicly that they want to move forward for a vote.
These things have no backlog," said The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona)'s last-minute pressure to carry out an FBI investigation is sufficient to appease the rebels.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is at the door!" when they manifested themselves in the Senate's court, as Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, the Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the records," said Stu Rothenberg, political analyst without party membership.
"People say it's already tall; it's true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among indecisive voters in suburban areas and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the appointed Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
"This has become a trap for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge. It's also about how Republicans dealt with the matter and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the USA Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of the respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford took an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her as an alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the man appointed to the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs when the two took part in a party during the period in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to rival with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joyfully stated that the intention underlying Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he referred to startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage" or POD.
This may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about the personal storage of online data is that it is up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal ability through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteering programmers.
Beginning this week, world-wide technology creators will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not talking to the "Facebook and Google on the introduction or not of a total change in which all your business models are turned from one day to the next.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a publication on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even as Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic with this next web era," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: tribute to the clergyman decorated with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergyman of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his Christmas city over 100 years.
Lieutenant-Coronel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandsons dropped a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brillably symbolic" that the plate had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that he gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable and machine guns".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and beating three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant-Coronel Vann was killed by a German franco-gatherer on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know he would never get equal, but also a lesson in humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the arrest, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored by participating in the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts agreed all night to see Bellator 206 attend instead to the Porca Peppa
Imagine this: it is agreed all night to see Bellator 206, full of stars and, in the end, it is prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 combats, with six of the main group, and was being displayed live during the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the spectators in the United Kingdom were amazed when the coverage changed to Peppa.
Some did not get impressed after they had been agreed until early in the morning especially for combat.
A fan on Twitter described the change to cartoons for children as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"The government regulation says that the content is not suitable for six o'clock in the morning, so they had to change to another programming," said Dave Schwartz, administrator with marketing and communications hair, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa pig," yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that it will correct the timing of the broadcasts to include the United Kingdom’s viewers in the future.
"I think, when I think of the repetition, I think we can solve the problem," said Coker.
"But it is six Sunday morning there and we will not be able to solve it until our Sunday hour, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were many different messages and no very nice messages.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was not: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about his sexuality
The Olympic divers Tom Daley said that they grew to feel inferior to everyone because of their sexuality, but that gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he got into high school that "they're not all like me."
In an interview with Radio 4's First Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he stated that it was manifested in favor of homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The program's long-term regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took a several-month strike due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "lower" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me power and strength to achieve success."
His goal was to prove that it was "someone," he said, not to let everyone down when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The dual Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and has used his participation in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The world champion said he was in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "he caught me by surprise".
Daley married last year with the Oscar winner, 20 years older, although he claimed that the age difference was never a problem.
"When we pass so when we are so young" - their first participation in the Olympics was at the age of 14 and the father died of cancer three years later - he said, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar heights and bass.
The couple had a son last June, called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all that mattered was "get a gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Your son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had the tickets for the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be in front row.
"I couldn't tell you that "you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and got a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of the whole life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics ...there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, from Heather Small - with which he had identified himself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
The Desert Island Discs spends on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m., British summer time.
Mickelson down at the bank at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th match on a Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the milestone from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the 12th time, a record of participations, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been in the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the main male championships divided the day between the supporter function and the work in his game in the field, hoping to correct what afflicts him.
Never having hit the most straight even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the ideal for the Le Golf National camp, where long rough usually punishes the wrong spots.
And if the field alone wasn't intimidating enough, Mickelson, on the 9th of Sunday, will face the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games by them this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage starting the 12 single matches, have a good start, the Miccelson match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a respected champion who gave a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't seen him playing two games.
I thought more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to go on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass on Sunday Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of matches played on Ryder Cup.
This can mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never equaled the successes of your individual curriculum.
Miccelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and spirity, he likes to play with people and he's an excellent person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week, too, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just to play."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage may disappear on a summit
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that his leadership on entering the last single day at Ryder Cup can easily become an accidental walk.
The Danish had its debut at the start of 1997 in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seven Ballesters held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the line of the goal with the nose with the narrowest of the margins, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a little while," said Bjorn, in the image, after attending the 2018 Tourma victory for 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead by 10-5 in the National Golf.
So, history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go ahead and do all right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I have always said that I concentrate on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enchanted with the performance of its players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead of myself on it.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow, what matters is individual performance and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message that we need to convey to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're going to leave the partner and he has to go and do the best of himself too."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself has already been on both sides of these great revolutions on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ends up losing when Europe took the "Milagre in Medina" card.
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important departures tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start as what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medina.
When this impulse turns to one side, the pressure is very large in these middle sections.
We organized our effective in accordance and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main part, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the ordering.
"I chose this group of players by this order because I believe it covers all the journey," Bjorn said about his choices for singles.
New German warship again postponed
The most recent frigate of the German Navy should have entered the service in 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War time. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to failures and an exponential growth cost, according to local media.
The entry to the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesperson.
The ship should have joined the navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems threatened the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the navy had ordered in 2007 will serve to replace the aged frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealing technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance, which would allow the most recent frigates to be sent to missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the last-generation warships, which are considered a way for Germany to design power beyond-frontier borders, will already be out of date when they come into service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to the yards of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to the yard after the delivery.
Little is known about the motives of the return, but the German media cite a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, since vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the quota required in the oldest frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the marine capacity to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz has twice the weight of ships of similar classes used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it will have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion, an increase compared to the initially budgeted EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems facing the most recent frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German Defence Parliamentary Committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem grew exponentially over time, as they were put out of service older ships without any vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates had been able to join the navy.
National Trust spies the secret life of bats
New investigations are being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands in order to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is expected that the results will focus some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and fruit, as well as chestnuts of long ears and Daubenton bats in the Invewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations spread by the property to follow the bat activities throughout the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
The expert analysis of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of the bat calls and what each species is doing.
It will then produce a habitat map to create a detailed image of its behaviors on the territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, an advisor for the conservation of the nature of the NTS, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affects dormitories and makes habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning turbines are also a threat, along with the masquerades and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given your night hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
It is for them to use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes the bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, inspections at dormitories and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, in the Threeade property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The director of the estate, David Thompson, says the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the bats we don't know, so the work we do here and in the other properties will help us to know more about what they need to bloom."
It highlighted the importance of checking whether there are bats before handling the properties, because the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
The bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, sit them down, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the audience to participate to help.
It was said by her: "We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are taking revenge."
Ronaldo exposes charges of rape when his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to promote" using his name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advanced Portuguese and Juventus selection was accused of violating an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is stated that you will then pay $375 000 to keep the alleged victim silent about the accident, read at Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to its 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo characterized the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," the winner of five Gold Balls said to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which characterized as "an inadmissible report of suspects in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player would require compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga have allegedly gone to the player's room, where the player has violated it annually, according to the documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo put himself on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99%" "a good type", harmed by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he addressed the police and had photographs of his injuries taken in a hospital, but that he later agreed to enter into an extrajudicial agreement because he felt "at terrorized by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims that she intends to annul the agreement, as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian Juve giants in a business of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "repend forever" to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repend forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, said the Secretary for Greg Clark Companies.
Clark also stated that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told BBC that if Great Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer reported that the impact of delays on borders in the case of an unagreed Brexit could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My perspective is that, if Great Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed concerns about the exit of the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, reported that it would close its Mining factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be the supply chain risks in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
Toyota's production line is managed on a just-in-time basis, with the parts to be reached every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU, for cars manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom abandons the EU without agreement on 29 March, disturbances on the border may occur, which the sector says can lead to delays and shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at her Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark stated that Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "calibrated precisely to avoid these checks at the border".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement to allow, as I said, not only the current success, but also the use by us of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4 Today program.
"The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers point out that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it was not possible to estimate the time off, Toyota said that, in the long term, the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and could, sooner or later, lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the United Union union in this place, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return.
A government spokesperson stated that "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "added another week" given that there is still no understanding as to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia’s advisers and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump could be preparing the Deputy Attorney-General's dismissal, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of filming the discussions with Trump in secret and the possibility of filing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, having information that he would be about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "I would rather not say goodbye" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week about the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press advisor, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, it may be this week, but it may also be postponed another week, in view of all that has happened in the Supreme Court.
I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: Sanders does not organize a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said that: "I wouldn't disagree with the fact that they like the protagonist."
It then made it clear that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding proof: "We have examined these numbers."
The press conferences will continue to occur, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this often and they've seen that we've done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
Soil press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, he appeared in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way before the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service on Brexit’s fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the release of the United Kingdom of the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover applications for the status of EU citizens working in the decentralized public services of the country.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal were continued, and decisions were expected for this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each official, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want a lot to continue here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after headache
The defense of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered head injuries in the defeat of Saturday 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, informed Mike Organ of the Tigers.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred just before the interval.
"He approached the lateral line and virtually fainted," Reed reported.
The technical team and medical personnel put Abercrombie oxygen on the lateral line before lying on a maca and transporting it to a more in-depth evaluation.
A representative of the team told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended the studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five plaques on Saturday before leaving the game, which increases his total season to 18 plaques.
A higher seal tax will be charged to foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party announced plans to charge a higher seal tax to foreign buyers who acquired properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to the homeless
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate
The increase in the seal tax will concern buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million per year to help homeless people
A higher rate of stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to homeless people, will announce today Theresa May.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises of providing more affordable accommodation and taxing higher incomes.
The rise in the seal tax will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue driving the government's campaign to offer a roof to homeless people.
The supertax - added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second dwellings and lease purchases - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that the measure will allow up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, raising prices and hindering market access for first-rate buyers.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy arises weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping the prices of the high properties when landing land that they do not use, demanding that Mrs May leave the quotas on the accessible dwellings to resolve the "disease of accommodation" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal for housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of "no justification" evictions.
It also wants to assign extended powers to municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not clear that it is as easy to buy home for people who live outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as for resident British workers.
For too many people the dream of being the owner of your house has become too far away and the shame of those who sleep in the relevatory remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland's coach Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is to become a selectr of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scots have been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the Northeast club, currently third ranked in the First League, at three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division at last time.
"I want to represent my country as a player.
But I only got an internationalization B," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"I grew to see Scotland playing in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if it succeeds in managing clubs."
Ross' predecessors as a Sunderland coach include Dick Advocato, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel afraid to succeed in such consecrated names in such a large club, after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, for the time being success is summed up the "I can take the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I reached that goal."
Ross' career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as an assistant coach of Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and took St. Mirren from the threat of defamation to the title of champion at the next time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he has ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads," she recalls.
"I've always seen more of myself in the role of coach than in the role of player.
It seems strange because it went well, I won my life as a player and had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressure of the position, but I feel very good as a coach.
I always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I ever felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The summer heat wave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The restoration groups experienced a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but the occupation of the restaurants decreased by 4.8%, showing the statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of England's good time and career at the World Football Championship, longer than expected, made the June standard, in which pubs recorded a 2.8% growth in sales, if repeated in July, but the restaurants knew a retreat.
The loss of 1.8% recorded in the sales of the restoration in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the drink-based business had by far the best performance, with a homologous growth that more than compensated for the drop in the restaurants.
Pubs with the business based on meals have also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the catering operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks increased 6.6% over the month, with the meals receding 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst for the leisure and catering sectors, said: "These results prolong the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors that influence the out-of-house food market sales.
It is no surprise that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is especially harmful when added to the prolongation of the cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not get worse for operators with the business based on meals. Only time will tell if the warmest temperatures we know in August will provide the desired relief."
The growth of the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the release of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, being recognized as the benchmark of the sector.
One in five children hidden from parents secret accounts on social networks
One in five children - some with only 11 years of age - has secret accounts in the social networks that hide parents and teachers, revealed a study
An investigation of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of the "false" pages on Instagram
News aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "primary" account to show parents
One in five children - some with only 11 years of age - creates accounts on the social networks that hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of "false" accounts on the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a "principal" account to show parents, while simultaneously holding private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found out that teenager was urging the others to "violate her."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC), revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Council of Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual General Assembly of the regulator.
Doyle is the most successful Scottish athlete medalist. President Ian Beattie has described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain from with their presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be able to act like the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute truly to help guide sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-metre test at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, no longer able to walk after a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered from a stroke.
I stopped being able to walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell you it would be able to recover and to what extent.
It has been a painful job but achieves a total recovery, I have learned to walk and even do exercises of agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Announcement of milk extraction pump compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk extraction pump company divided the opinions online with an announcement comparing mothers who breastfeed cows in the order.
To mark the launch of that one that is described as the "first portable silent pump milk extraction", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom conferred by the new pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled vacation to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm ordering myself, but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have boobs, these are my breasts."
The ref goes on to say, "Bomb, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the announcement published on the company’s Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, with many saying it relieves the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"I tried to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen a few days after they were born," wrote a spectator.
Elvie's extraction pump is discreet in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone also said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the announcement, as a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious".
"I think the idea is great.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it makes all the sense.
This product is great," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It is a fun announcement directed to mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like "vaces".
It's not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, it has no threads or tubes and it falls discreetly within a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, catch their babies and even get out of the house while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director of "Mother", commented: "Elvie's bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative release.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while we presented in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was a blanket.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded on the walkway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly displaced for a camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children reached a peak, although the monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the severe rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult for children to be sheltered.
Traditionally, most of the "patterns" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by offering themselves to support a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential employers and other adults who integrate their family aggregates would have to record their fingerprints, the data being shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified to the Congress that the service held dozens of people who applied to defend unaccompanied minors.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"About 80% of their parents or members of their family aggregates are illegal in the country, many of whom are foreign nationals with criminal registration.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, in accordance with the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconferencing, and not in person, to defend your application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid shall be promptly deported.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to access to violence or escape attempts, according to the employees of the reception centres and with reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated in installations of larger dimensions like those of Tornillo, where the large size contributes to the signs of disturbance of children being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma with which many are already debating.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of American, French and Turkish occupation forces
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country in his eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally in Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
"We must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions still displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all and any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and counseling the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for his return were ensured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led the refugees to remain abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN Diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone on the last great rebel bastion of Idlib created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement established "clear steps" and expressed hope in which military action targets the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, expects to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interferences.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the challenge and scandals end their presidency in advance.
For the one who would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of an ever-present presidency"!
At the moment, there are no signs of the viewer's tiredness.
Since 2014, the high-time audiences more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in noble hours, a climb to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million spectators on big news nights.
"This is a strong call for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC program "Designed Survival", about a chief cabinet who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedy veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Remember once you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him I was going to vote Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos have entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories from Washington can determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family meetings of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can give.
And yet, it is more than being a citizen informed when we are watching at the sixth hour a debate by experts on the use by Bob Woodward of "deep knowledge" sources in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather blouse ("a piece of clothing full of insolence", as mentioned by Washington Post) and the implications of the squabrous descriptions of Stormy Daniels from... um... anatomy of President Trump.
I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he's done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", on Trump's dynamic list and the daily spins of the plot (attached with NFL, praised Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose an episode or stay behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was closed at home, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He did not deduct television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify to the Senate's Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people said: this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Significant external financing in the interim elections for the House of Representatives
It is no wonder that the 17th circle of Pennsylvania knows a flow of funding, thanks to a realignment of the electoral circles that left two holders in the race at the same place.
The recent readjustment of the suburban circles of Pittsburg placed in the race the Democratic Conor Lamb, who gained its place in another circle in an extraordinary election in the past spring.
Lamb candidates against another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old circles unconstitutionally favored the Republicans.
The race through the 17th circle sparked a hard fight for the financing of the campaign between the financial arms of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangent victory in the highly contested extraordinary elections of March for the 18th electoral circle of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This place had been occupied for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the circle for 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to Democrats.
U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, going back then
Some diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump Organization from the management.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of the US diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," Heather Nauert, spoke for the Department of State, in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million of US aid in 2017, including for the control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The penalties proposed, which included cuts in financial aid and visa-specific restrictions, would have severely penalised this Central American country with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
With the continuation of internal meetings, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to follow forward, putting aside all and any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now marked by mid-October, in a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The spokesperson of the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials of the United States, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal deliberations covered by the anonymity.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst near the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be dropped may be the report of legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be allegedly guiding his investigation to see if Trump's campaign has conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face the responsibility of that body, while preparing to introduce himself again to the voters and perhaps to be judged by his peers.
That is a great deal of hypothesis and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup d'état, since the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around inflection points like this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or blocked.
Americans currently face several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secreting the President, speculating about his inability to perform the position.
Rosenstein says the news of The Times is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court, despite the credible accusations of sexual abuse and dishonesty?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress responsible for Mr Trump?
If we suck in these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we're not going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that in time occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the susassic.
With an inheritance of these, how could I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Optimist Rangers before the game with the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain with the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify for the G Group of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented the medium Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time until the match to two golos with the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as trampolim for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the game with a positive mindset and we won a point.
Perhaps we could have gained near the end, but in global terms, the draw was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
Last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there's a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past time and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep with fear of this account saving-reform
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey have a clear idea about the type of care they want to take, few people have talked to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking with their children about the same subject.
"People want a relative to look after you, but they're not having that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide life insurance industry.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't give them their wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial consultant: Your consultant may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Their choices of financing of continuing care may include a long-term traditional insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary value to help cover such expenditure or funding using their own savings, provided that these values are available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care provider, choosing a person of their trust to supervise their health care and ensure that professionals respect their wishes if they are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the establishment of a prosecutor's office on his finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers from a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer the questions about medication and allergies?
Includes this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only financial issues are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What's the medication?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan."
Men shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure when he returned home after one night in the city.
The victim, at the age of forty, was in the Oxford Grove area, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a random act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
Wounds do not involve life risks and the police have asked for witnesses.
Sixsomes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reported to the authorities, hoping that the number of dead would increase.
With the interrupted communications, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Dogalga region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dogalgaa on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dogalea is a region that extends over 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status below one province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dongalga.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Domigaa have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past one hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dogalga.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring, being regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, originated a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong seismos reached the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, resulting in a tsunami that fell on the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, depolating a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the debris of the buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes reached the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska governor and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of aggression.
29-year-old Palin, resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and detention resistance, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska Police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone off.
Palin was arrested in advance at the pre-trial detention centre of Mat-Su, subject to a $500 bail, he reported to KTUU.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously, innocent," reported the station.
Palin is facing charges for three Class A offences, which means that he may be sentenced to a sentence of up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by a jail day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of smashing her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans' associations after associating the violent behavior of the child with post-traumatic stress due to her service in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died following a earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 originated a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electrical and communications networks have been cut, waiting for the number of dead to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the Sulawesi Central region, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jacarta.
They circulate videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutor's Office is calling for rare capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The New York Public Ministry calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state by a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is accused of using a truck rented by the Home Depot to execute an attack in October, on a cycle in West Side Highway, in the Lower Manhattan, trapping pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and inflicted "intendedly" serious injuries, according to the notification calling for the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges may be punished with the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight accusations of murder at the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Prosecutor in organized crime cases, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack demanded a "considerable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed it as "atroz, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," he said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade, the South Zone of New York did not ask for the death penalty for an accusation.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug traffickers, but the penalty was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted by conspiracy to commit spying acts for the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, natural from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators to feel good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the accusation.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, he referred to the police.
He declared himself innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the accusers not to apply for the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should feel the pressure of Euros, while one of Theresa May's Members suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative second-hand Member Peter Bone said at Birmingham's demonstration that the United Kingdom "would have already left" if Farage were Minister of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile her deeply divided correligaries was stressed by conservatives who defend permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The first administration has been debating to maintain its commitment plan, known as Plano Chequers, in the face of the attacks of Brexit partisans, permanence defenders and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Euroceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave in Solihull's concert that he intended "to end the plan."
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd have left," he said.
The Member of Wellingborough added: "I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan."
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone denied the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their ideas and wants to remain is totally uncapped."
The conservative defender of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration, telling journalists: "I simply say: Madam first administration, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Let the Checkers Plan fall and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: "Only the prime ministers who can keep their promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are prepared to betray the ruling out of the 2016 referendum.
"This became a question of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they won't get away with it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to pressure our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud, self-government United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the defenders of the stay marched to Birmingham before organizing a two-hour concert in the city center.
A crowd of activists posted tracks with the message "Conservators against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The representative of Labour in the Chamber of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with an application of the party in the opening of the congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for the 'Canada plus', for the frontier without friction, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren is planning to "put the President in serious"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll seriously "put the nomination to the President" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a usual critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for re-election in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, co-mandate of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that you will be able to face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in format of debate since Trump's possession.
One of the participants asked whether he planned to apply for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our government's problems and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrest in the context of the murder of Wayde Sims of the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect for the murder of the LSU Tigers basketball player, Wayde Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11:00 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Yes, 20-year-old, he was shot near the Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims took a shot at his head, following which he ended up dying," the chief of police officer Murphy J. Paul told the reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde was defending a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted his presence on the spot, laying a weapon, recognizing that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-meter junior created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was held for 10 times last time, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recovers per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following the team's orders
It became clear from the moment when Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders in Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Coming out of the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position in the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxers and made Hamilton have to face the traffic at the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxing once more and went after Vettel, but Hamilton passed it after a rhinated squamous squamous, after which Ferrari's pilot reluctantly left the internal part of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double correction of trajectory to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race, exchanging tires too late, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to overcome Kimi Raikkonen to end up in fourth place.
It ended up coming to the boxing on the 44th round but failed to improve its pace on the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to end up in room.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me out of it.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein at a concert on Saturday due to her insistence that she had not revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a summit in Western Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Committee of Justice, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more, malicious and false".
"See the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in the last days, see the anger, see how people are more, malicious and false," Trump said.
"When we see the leaks and the communiqués and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Did Dianne Feinstein escape from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't leave me.'
Well, wait there.
The escape came from us... no, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented at the beginning of Saturday night: "You know that more, that was a terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the nomination for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the accusations in his favour.
"They are determined to resume power by resorting to all means.
We see wickedness, wickedness, it doesn't matter who can achieve it, who has to walk to take over power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat by Belfast Giants for 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed from the defeat on Friday in the First Division against the Belfast Giants game, winning the second hand for 5-3 on Saturday, in Dundee.
The Giants had an initial advantage of two goals with endings by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the house team before Dwyer put the Giants in front again.
François Bouchard tied to Dundee before two golos of Lukas Lundvald guarantee the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a revolution on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee for 2-1.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, with the Giants winning the three previous games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following assistance from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the advantage four minutes later.
In the first frenetic period, Sullivan re-placed the house team in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the draw to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants to arrive at the first interval in leadership, marking their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.

The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape from the earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after dying by ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people died and many still disappeared after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, resulting in a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to melt the region, leaving many residents buried in the debris in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grande refused to leave his post while the control tower ravaged with violence at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained focused to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was then on the track, took off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower in front of the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Air Navigation Agency, Yohannes Sirat, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian television network ABC News.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"We were devastated by this news," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can reach the thousands, referring to the country's disaster management agency that access to the cities of Dogalga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, since there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet managed to rescue," said the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting help and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The minimarkets are being caught everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, in charge of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he went to the military forces on site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete evacuation operations.
At the beginning of this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that took the lives of over 550 people.
Flying in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that there is a man missing after the fall of the plane in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the aircraft that was deployed in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after reporting that all 47 passengers and the crew had been rescued safely from the plane sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini stated that, from Saturday afternoon, he could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The area company claimed to be collaborating with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for disclosure of more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane took off in the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The official authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline advanced that six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet known what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the runway and loved the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off the track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming too low.
"It was the best thing that happened," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other people had been able to crawl with the water through the waist and reach the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He reported that the attendants had panicked and started shouting, and that they had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working in a nearby spring improvement also helped in the rescue by travelling to an inflatable boat to transport people to the land before the plane sank to 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents with registered companies from PNG, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its claims on Saturday in the new judgment of a man accused of burning a woman in the Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to reconstitute the movements of the 20-year-old archduke Quintom Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained localized data from several mobile phones confirming that Telllis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that your phone was with Chambers at the time you claimed to have been with your friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville."
Another incongruence in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
The phone records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett stated that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted SMS messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"You paid her for her life," said Hale.
The defence should start presenting its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to begin to be examined by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop conscious?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling your music with positive messages.
Bristol's High Breed group claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return popularity to the conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have attended a recent rebirth in the United Kingdom thanks to the intervention of other interpreters, such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
Lover of New York processes couple by dismissal through a "racist" SMS message
A New York nurse is prosecuting a couple for discriminatory dismissal after having received a text message from her mother mistakenly complaining that "it was another black."
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed some fear when she discovered that the new mistress Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself for her first day of work in 2016.
"I CAN'T BELIEVE... MORE A PRETA," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when he noticed his gaffe, a "daughter" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the poor performance of the former African American mistress and who was waiting for a Filipino mistress.
Giselle Maurice was paid for his only day of work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is sueing the couple and asking for a dismissal compensation of USD 350/day for the six-month period for which she had been selected without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't stay unpunished," said the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, saying that saying goodbye to Giselle was perfectly logical because they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent you something that I really didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco said to the Post.
"Would your children trust someone they had treated badly?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
Calling the "extortion" process, Plasco said that his wife had been a mother for only two months and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue someone like that?
It's not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the legal process took place, the public opinion court was quick to condemn the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that the Paddington publishers feared that readers might not identify themselves with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard for us to put on someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's really fun to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a small bear to play writing the children's book, would not have brought his chest if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication had an agricultural flavor given his death last year.
About Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family", said that the father was very proud of the success achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to the gabarolik," he said.
"But as Paddington was as real to him, it was as having a successful son: we are proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her phone.
Soon after landing, the daughter had been taken from emergency to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that the situation was even bad and that there was no chance of surviving," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that she had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medicines doctors had given him to keep his heart working were slowly giving up and leaving his system.
He had been dead for some time and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or lament because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold myself."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, now grieving for her daughter's loss, boarded the plane along with other passengers outside the evidence why she was passing by.
"No one knew," he said.
"I've always been low-headed.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women attach bridge cards to avoid suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Sharon Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said the son was a chief promising man with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it would light the room."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had "merged in darkness."
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible repercussion."
Sharon Davis created the postcards so they know that there are people who are available to help and who they can talk to, or that he's a friend.
Don't shut up in yourselves, you have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, long-time friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his 15-year-old companion, very soon after the mother-in-law's death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in your behavior.
When the kids opened the presents, they didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to keep on living and fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the beginning of the FBI's investigation
"I thought that in terms of what I had asked for - a research with defined time and scope - we could be closer together," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, pointing out that the committee was afraid to "demote" in the face of an entrenched party impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Its reluctance is merely a temporary issue.
The interim elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met Ashley, the personal secretary of Bush at that time.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not true that Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to cast the vote of office and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea decreased during the Kim regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea has declined since the rise to the power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
Quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2706 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers of people ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang didn't make any public statements.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korea deserters.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally passed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters illegal and non-refugees, and is often repatriated.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are in a dead end.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the U.S.A., Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general lines, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Ministers Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the Chamber, said that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
So he made these comments in an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to the testimony of Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse bonds to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a loud and resolver voice, speaking of his family and of the years of high school.
He also explicitly accused the Democrats of the commission, calling for the allegations made against him of "sassin of grotesque and conspiracy character" organized by bullied liberals by Hillary Clinton having lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said to believe that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he has no condition to serve in the Supreme Court given his preconceived conduct against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would attempt to challenge the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don't meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. Circuit Relations Court.
Thus he added that, as a Democrat, he was afraid of potential opinions from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (most well known by Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh asked questions about the possibility of repealing certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of fury to tranship, and it can't get rid of without crying.
"We make it when we're scratching," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"Don't think it's weird to me, don't you think?"
A woman with an executive position in a company helped me immensely. She told me that she would cry when she was angry, but she had created a technique. When she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
The tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well that, in an old job dominated by men in an office in which he cried with inexpressible rage, being caught by the neck by an older woman - a manager nothing friendly that frightened me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be happy that they've been able to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, the Democratic Congressman of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extra-husband relationship on board a boat called Monkey Business and gave up his candidacy, a Patricia Schroeder who was extremely frustrated did not see why she could not apply herself to the presidents.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who called the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Years."
Given its late entry, the fundraiser was below the desirable and swore that he would only enter the race if he managed to raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters only gave him $250, although they had given him $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top - gratitude for the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and brings the message to the voters instead of the delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears arose.
"Even seemed depressed," recalled Patricia Schroeder, speaking of the media's reaction.
"I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would they now write on my epitaph?
"She cried?"
As the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first rescue of the trade war between the U.S. and China was surprising, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the perspective of the experts, the departure of the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S.A., fired the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing important Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week was the stage of a significant aggravation of the situation with the new rates to affect goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), actually taxing half of all goods sent by China to the US.
Beijing has always cut back on the same coin, raising the rates from 5 to 10 percent for US goods at $60 billion.
China has committed itself to following the steps of the U.S.A. and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will vacillate in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean complying with the demands, but showing a public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its trumps, the pressures imposed by the U.S. trade war can positively sustain China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In reality, the fact that an early political decision in Washington or Beijing can result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of reflections.
Minister for Foreign Affairs states that Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by over seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have abandoned because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would receive a good deal of help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Selection beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National around Paris, France.
The U.S. now accumulates six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time they won Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is once again crowned victorious after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Miccelson, who showed that he had serious difficulties during almost the entire tournament, threw the tea from the water in the 16th hole, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst ranked player in the European Selection, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best-class player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England where it could have been his last participation in Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most award-winning European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I can't contain myself.
It was a hard year.
I can't stop thanking Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm really glad we beat the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help," said an emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
The word goes to his fellow countryman Jon Rham who defeated the legend of the American Gulf, Tiger Woods, for 2&1 in singulars on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew to see him playing," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles winning and just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection were discussed as they arrived at the fairway.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the disappointing performance of his team. "I take care of them. They fought.
This morning, we were able to put some fear in Europe.
Let's fight.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players were excellent.
We're going to reorganise and I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to keep going.
I like many of these 12 players and I'm proud to be your captain.
I have to take my hat off to the other team.
They were better."
