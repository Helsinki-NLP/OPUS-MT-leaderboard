Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American President of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will be awarded, among other things, for its exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy schedule.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet his peak in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth President of the United States to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize in the Committee's very presence.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan when the price was paid.
The president does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at present.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to emphasize.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate to charitable works, but has not yet specifically decided which works.
His program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned feeling that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who uphold the same values as him.
From the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A nature defender accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police charged the president of the Litoměřice nature protection company with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for his call, said Alena Romová, spokesman of the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Litoměřice Nature Protection Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk for up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting buckets are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinks packs, while in the villages of Southern Moravia you fall on sorting buckets at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before you find the right bandages.
I don't mean we wouldn't pick up all the waste in Brno.
But it seems to me that the city councillors, our second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the Stone Age of Waste Sorting not only because citizens can still choose only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of buckets dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is all science, which requires especially time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't like it, but it seems to me very little.
Not to mention that in other neighborhoods of the city it's not a safe either.
So to finish, many of my friends don't pick their waste.
Par paresse.
It makes them a trot to get to the buckets.
I'm not surprised about that.
I myself, after a party, offered to throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any Kounicova street colored buckets.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, isn't it?!
It is likely that ecology and a so-called aestheticism do not interest too much the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying a few extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after having dragged a moment on the internet.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has removed pension and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or public servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or savings on housing.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the government's borrowing for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's only to restore the problems later, to mine the ground," Janota said.
It is important to know that the interest to be paid is increasing and that it will need to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those currently increasing left: firefighters, educators, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their retirement or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater government debt - next year there will not be 163 billion in cash registers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will increase rapidly and, with it, interest-related expenses.
The State will need money to repair it and it will not be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of electors.
These are mainly already decided and started sections that cannot be amended to possibly reduce costs.
At least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 large construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the caution of Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very rightly - it will be able in the dividends of ČEZ (electric power supplier and distributor), which the State has in most of its power and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the elimination of environmental damage, to supplement retirement accounts or to serve as a reserve for the reform of the pensions that are being prepared.
In addition, this tip increases the real deficit in the budget to 5.7 percent of the GNP in accordance with EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crimes, even the savings of housing, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, Janota notes.
The Minister will then have to save on the side of the department or, at the worst, reach the government's budgetary reserve.
There is also a shortage of one hundred million in the state fund project of two billion, which must be monitored online for each administration's expenditure.
The first step will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance had no money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have taken place, Janota was warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed appear promising.
Just a button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American VMware company, which deals mainly with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alter between them, you can differentiate them into staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and there was a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones has nothing to do with fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a trial version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is growing.
VMware now works with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices 2012.
Mountain snow shortage worries hotels
Desert tracks do not pose any problem only to uplift operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to set up free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits on our website.
Netizens travel through offers, ask for prices but do not wish to make a reservation for the moment.
And if they call us, they ask immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operating the Spindl.Info information portal.
If we want to spend the New Year's dream on Špindler, it is better not to hesitate too much to book.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation comes next, then you can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hotels offer only one week's stay for New Year.
I think they're going to try a little longer to place them, but they're also going to go ahead and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," said Jandura.
The Vrchlabí Tour Agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We're most interested in Christmas week for now, it's not completely sold.
It remains free, let's say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some less expensive last minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency may also offer New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February go as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert thinks.
On the other hand, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for New Year's as well as Christmas.
There is great interest during the holiday of Janvier des Poles and February also sells itself well," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at ninety percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have 60 percent occupation at the moment.
February is a little lower for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will yet grow certainly indicated the director of Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Krkonoše hotels, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be fresher and if there are precipitations, they should be neigious in the mountains.
But later, time should be warmed up, reports Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition is mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of the wise, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he considered to be simple himself.
When he ended up letting his doctrine so heavily awaited, he found that he had picked it up in carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is, in addition, to use the title of the speech of Bush of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into an Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
However, the following months have shown that Bush's strategy, which made recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful at such a time that the newspapers at present do not speak of Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that said, objectively, he left his successor a much more favourable final situation than we could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will reproduce
Again, it was the campaign commanders who asked for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the house Blanche's reluctance despite the subordination habits.
He called for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months but without a better option, he failed at least the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to remove the additional 5,000 from Europe's promises, even though he had about 10,000 at the outset.
What brings the most problems to Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to remove the armies of Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this whole process in three years' time. Obama's entire doctrine brings more questions than it does provide answers.
Many doubt the fact that a half increase will bring the same fruits as the progression in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite - one cannot count on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their day-to-day leadership according to what arranges them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain from powder to the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity in relation to reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "early state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy makes his volunteerism perplexed.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only made it worse and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for their "early return to the house" will bring there a true miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect confession of the U.S. defeat.
NATO's last summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is turning to the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and strengthened sanctions have no effect on Iranians, Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
For example, it will be necessary to respond when, according to Obama, America is coming to the victorious withdrawal of Afghanistan's troops.
However, each solution of this type will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only Rustine for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for it to plan on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Bank leaders Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums
High-ranking employees from the US Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced this to respond to strong criticisms about its wage practices.
The group of 30 leading leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resale until five years.
The actions may be withdrawn to the leaders in case they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link remuneration with long-term performances on Wall Street.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank became the target of critics after almost $17 billion was set aside for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total premium will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters Agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, strong bank sector premiums have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it was counting on a single tax of 50 percent to affect bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel prizes in all areas except physics
There are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm the hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in Technical and Literature Disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the Romanian writer Herta Müller.
Two U.S. biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received the Nobel Prize in Medicine with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry price was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to clarify the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award has now been given to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with William Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the Certificate of Acquisition of the Money Reward.
It reaches 10 million Swedish crowns in each category. (about 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The highly awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been given this afternoon in Oslo in Norway to President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward because it is only at the beginning of his journey and he is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is indispensable to gain peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is planning to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who will put his stay to the government because of his disagreement with the State budget for the coming year as he was voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota at the firm will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticized the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which further increases the public finances crisis.
It was the spokesperson President Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the Chamber of Deputies has validated on Wednesday the left-wing proposals for money transfers and has increased the salaries of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government was criticizing the proposals of the Social Democrats for the indirect increase in the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, which called into question the future of the Fischer cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by the MPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer government and which, according to him, has to address the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but does not require anything, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrefenable deficiency" of public finances.
Now he believes there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could rely on a wider consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is faltering and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, ODS and Greens obviously no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "drastic truths".
The leader of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Government of Topolánek is fading and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD has successfully qualified the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, the South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will exhibit a lot of things in the world about the country, its battles and its victories.
The story speaks of sport, race relations with Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor rewarded with Oscars, incarnates Nelson Mandela's life film, invigorating against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a ninety-first-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate her in the movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally..
The sixty-two-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in the Million Dollar Baby drama in Clint Eastwood in the middle of boxing, for example, has incarnated the leader of a movement against slavery becoming himself a slave, a president of the United States fictional, or even God in the film Evan Tout-Power but never one of still alive and as important for so many people as is Mandela.
The former South African man was imprisoned 27 years for his hard work in support of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word that means invincuous and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unite the country. President Mandela recently elected knows that his country remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is persuaded to be able to unite his people with sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among outsiders worldwide.
The South African team will finally make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to large screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dine with him, to be in a retreat before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to hold his hand.
I realized that when I held your hand, I recovered from your energy, it was transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard environment of rugby.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pinear was: 'I look a lot bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the actual models, Invictus under the direction of the director Eastwood received positive opinions and even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Todd McCarthy's film critic of Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well realized film."
In film evaluations on the rottentomatoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway was observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only recognized that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the “Bulava” missile that was originally to be the pride of the Russian army became gradually the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as the "non-fly missile"
A missile that doesn't fly but that shines
This 13th test was conducted at the beginning normally.
It's only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the device.
It was clearly the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be fired from a moving and immersing vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably by a defective "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians have not doubted for a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak of failure at all.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the avalanche affected only the third.
In the previous cases, engines have encountered failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went through without a hit, the Ministry of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirteen failed.
This success rate of almost 50 percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and so they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will take even ten hypersonic nuclear kernels of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will re-enter a 51-year-old professional game.
The world's former champion, Stanley Cup's Olympic champion and owner will lend a hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry to the game on Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who completed his 40-year career in 1998, is the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details about the form, says the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchinov club, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he twice bought gold at the Olympic Games, seven World Champions, he won Canada Cup and World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he collected tributes also in NHL where he twice held Stanley Cup.
He has been a member since 2001 of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancelled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions reported a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman for Petr Vaněk at Hyundai factory confirmed it.
However, management wants to agree again with the unions on a Saturday that has been worked this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, therefore, that voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
Sedmička.cz site reported that the company offered a 400-czech bonus to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a postponing for the day worked on November 28th.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
They either receive the supplement for extra hours, or they can place a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their end-of-year holidays indicated Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and warmest point in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work almost two overtime hours a day in more than eight hours.
Trade unions are planning to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the automotive plant and the unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday they were ready to stop the strike in the event of agreement on their claims and signing of a common document.
The situation at the plant ended last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously got into a strike because of unrelenting overtime.
They also protested against the poor conditions of wages and alleged bizuages.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees were required to work as a supplement to meet the requirements for car production.
On the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also asked that employees who had ceased production be not subject to any sanctions.
Trade unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (about € 209) for them.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last year in November.
It has produced approximately 80,000 vehicles up to September of this year, with a capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: A substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality, in some cases, takes the top on the fact that the combination does not deal as intensively with the current variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, the life of the sick can be radically prolonged through a combination of medicines that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs have no effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to confront the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalcarbores are an assembly of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the resistance problem.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links to virus proteins.
Metalcarbores have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by the bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a HIV protein that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, there would be no mature infectious particles in the virus.
If HIV is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will be stopped, explains researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Republic Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested as well as on its resistant variants from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical medicinal products, but it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which current medicinal products are often ineffective.
Metalocarbores, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to examine further to address the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina ○ezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Debates of the European Parliament
The President of the ODS (Democrat Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek has described the ratified budget as "trafficking" for the following year, and according to him, Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should challenge his existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the SDO's remarks for drastic verdict.
He says take some time to analyze.
The spokesperson for ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party obviously did not work anymore.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide to take part in the House of Deputies' support for the minority concerned with combating the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in his office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDO and of the social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with the proposed amendments of 12 billion crowns included on the left.
The Chamber increased the money for employees' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance with the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The SDO left the room before the vote, obeying the Government's wish as if an amended budget was a less bad option than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to quit his duties in the event of ratification of the proposals for amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota met with the Prime Minister on Monday after his transition to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he wondered if he was going to remain in his office.
Its disappointment about the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of ČSSD, who have imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not at issue.
This is the case of the head of Fischer government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDO did not do anything harmful, emphasized Topolánek in a text communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of some departments are demanding TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign from a struggle against the deficit in public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the Chamber."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I didn't think about it and once it's going to be on the agenda, then I'm going to dedicate myself to it, since the Chamber said to the journalists, Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO has acted backwards at the request of the Prime Minister.
At the same time, Nečas pointed out that the SDO would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democratic MPs to allow the budget to vote.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, did he react to the question of whether the ODS had not been blamed by the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I didn't notice my vote was missing.
I already knew when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevizization of the Chamber and a destruction of everything that was positive, was Topolánek's reaction in person.
According to the new ČD schedules, there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit certain less-loaded express or regional trains from 13 December onwards and will, on the contrary, strengthen some other trains.
Total coverage of transport will fall to the date of entry into force of the new two percent times compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, residents of the Ostrava region will have more links to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino copper.
On the contrary, an expression will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be fewer rapid trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Kralové region from eight percent to a total, but Prague and its surroundings can rejoice with an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the traffic of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the major transformations, one can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being, the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the esko suburban system, which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main train station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will start at two hours.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13th.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Roads to iron next year in a total of four billion crowns to settle visible losses, which is the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate to almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million cheaper.
The Railways have again signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Iron Roads appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not used a price increase of the vast majority of transport titles.
The changes will only affect tickets for one day ČD Net and internet tickets at reduced prices eLiška.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the journey, while until then it was valid among cities of a region to choose and was at a unique rate of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels today removed 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP that informed them, but spoke of the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields during a leak in front of the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP Agency, the rebels belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP Agency, the police first continued the violence caused by the settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre linked to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in American halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates a part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the global known apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the feedback from critics and the audience is heard.
Nelson Mandela
He was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa, by Nelson Rolilahla Mandela.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov prize for his freedom of mind, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full readiness for the cutting-up of the world of football, and also because the media are being acted upon by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are, for the time being, rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations to the main roles of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of the film by taking back his own terms.
I dreamed of this long-standing role, and I was well prepared.
I also have many times met personally Nelson Mandela to be able - as we say - to recover from his energy, he indicated during the first film official in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns each individual.
Bringing the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the British writer John Carlin's novel being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicting the South African human rights defender during his mandate to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying to collect two racial groups from a long-divided population, and Nelson Mandela was dressed in 1995 by the South African team's national jersey on the lawn of the world's cup, which South Africa had won at that time.
Mandela was long ovated 14 years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white people in South Africa as something sacred.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in bringing people together again in one nation, said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the situation in South Africa is going to improve.
The South African whites, however, are skeptical as recently entrusted with an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flame in the region of Louny
A fire covered in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukaš Marvan, spokesperson for Ústí firemen, there are six units that operate on fire.
They originally had to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinions and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the company spokesperson Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission package.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity, Čeps did not know anything like this and that such incidents are isolated.
The electricity supply was not interrupted, says the spokesman for the company ČEZ for the Bohème du Nord Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution points with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transport assemblies to distribution sets and lines of a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, the owner of Student Agency, is going to file today a complaint for defamation against three social democratic prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the Prefect of the Olomoc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura told her in Dvacet minute of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to exploit regional railways in some regions.
However, all regions have concluded long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three of them attacked us and said that we made the mouth ends, while we made only one offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So there's nothing left for us but to defend ourselves.
In exchange for slander about the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that there was evidence that no region had complied with European law.
We are therefore preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the complaint filed by Mr Jančura represents the continuation of his media show, which serves as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
Of course I am willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I assume that this will be a clear opportunity to show that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertising that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and that he intended to resume it after New Year.
He specified that the campaign would aim at corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without a call for tender.
According to Jančura, such a way of doing so is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even caused Jančura threats from a Member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we might lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcals will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcals will reverse the old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voting is already taking place, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices to be paid for health insurance.
Specialists also see clear evidence in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination was started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid for themselves.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcals.
However, parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of younger children requires four doses.
Experts believe that each year health insurance spends 300 to 450 000 crowns in vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
So far, the State has spent about 500,000 crowns per year on all vaccination of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of severe infections including inflammation of the meninges and poisoning of the blood.
According to hospital investigations, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age from pneumococcal infections were reported.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced refunded vaccination.
Is vaccination mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlass Rudolf Kalovský Association indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcals.
At an international conference at which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it's a direction now to follow, Kalovský said.
But the Department of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not looking at him for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Vaccination optionally has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Paediatric Society, recognizes that a vaccination based on volunteerata is not possible.
If all children were vaccinated, a decrease in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making vaccination optional," however Cabrnochová said.
Experts plan that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcals is also broken because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release prevention funds, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This, however, is related to the concerns of paediatric practitioners, who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to purchase vaccines by insurance, and doctors receiving them in the same way as other State-provided vaccine products.
Some Members, however, feared that this would allow insurance to "deduct health insurance amounts".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to repay them.
It is estimated that pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It'll be a long way from being easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Vol de musée"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings for a value of $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interrogated while he was loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr.Frazetta and another man used a mechanical skin to force the museum entrance to the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reporting the News Agency Associated Press (AP).
AP cited a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Frazetta Jr claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the tables to a storage facility," reported the agency.
Frazetta Senior denied such permission, the agency said.
Labour defends the increase in the budgetary tax.
The Ministers defended the increase in the tax and the reductions in expenditure announced in the pre-Budget report, despite the criticism of opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that it was serious about the decrease in deficit by reporting its decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the whippings by dealing with low wages and average wages.
Its main proposals include an increase of 0.5% of the Social Assurance and a ceiling of 1% on public salaries from 2011.
The Wrath of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession of which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" were announcing.
The decrease in social security - which will allow about GBP 3 billion per year - has made the world of businesses angry, because he believes it is a job tax while the objective should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will still increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers bonuses
The increase in corporation profits tax for small companies has been abandoned
Rates of electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a person earning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while a person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
The Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 resulted in "hard decisions" but stressed that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would weigh on the first 5 per cent of employees.
Stephen Timms, Secretary of the Treasury, rejected an increase in tax and pointed out that a decrease in expenditures was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential in the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and the growth of the economy would start again at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be met - have been questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP above the pre-estimation.
"Opportunity missing"'
The Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign this Thursday warning against Labour's "debt crisis," claimed that the GBP 789 billion loan project over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, elucidating "cyclically" difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to be held in June 2010.
"They did not present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
"The important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from the forthcoming reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would result in a faster and more significant decline in the deficit.
But Lib Dems claimed that the money collected through the increase in taxes and the decrease in expenditure would be used to support next year's spending rather than to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were "constructed on the wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC Political Editor, said that the announcements calendar - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April next, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda accusations, money being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the ministers did not publish the details of spending beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that restrictions on public spending would start to feel only in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Estudes Fiscales) affirmed that the Chancellor's figures involve substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including potential transportation, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is in fact only deferred," said his director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Counsellor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report.
The FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest, in Pakistan, of five American reporters, suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid in a home in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab , announced the US Embassy in Pakistan, BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sought information about these individuals.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani descent, one Egyptian heritage and the other from Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesman, said the agency had heard about the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and if it is true that the students are missing," she said.
Pakistan's embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncles.
She said that the house was already monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
State Secretary Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters news agency, but stated that the United States had to " collaborate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been taken away from home by their families in Northern Virginia, late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the report of Amnesty International.
the report presents "repeats of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the June presidential elections.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its lack of respect for human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's disputed election led to the greatest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens were sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claimed that at least five people were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, said our correspondent.
"It's a confession."
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed he was accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against election results.
"They have often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the candidate losing the election, Mehdi Karroubi, affirmed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested, over the past three weeks, in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the park of the city
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform Bristol's site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 skiers and semi-professional snowboarders in competition for in-kind prices.
Upstairs of Brandon Hill Park, a small tramplin preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the top view of the track was beautiful but that it was rather intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shining in the background.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowborders in the country - of real talents", he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be left at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book by the author, "Why the French don't like scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided the country for 15 years and the effects of which are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book presents a much wider and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim Spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the discussions between teachers and students on the issues most relevant to them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or the town hall (or both)?
Should evolution and the rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to get a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't start the debate to the very end.
The conservators do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyer counterparts of a Purist Islam Sunni associated with Saudi Arabia today are a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the guardian intellectual elite so virulent of secularity) were actually committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, in relation to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than increasing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramaticly than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
He knew of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved them by hunting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter, then brave 14-year-old who had only to fight the point of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming beside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show assembled 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually a millionth of the surface required for an adult in freedom.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of the algae that were in its thick fur.

Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose on the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Motoski Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the most northern waters of these two nations of hunting that ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alumn Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a thrilling overview of what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherics nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of changes.
There's no need to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th, the pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information about the glacial calotte source.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the underlying relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the largest of the work is made by men in hardened, camping in cold.
Anderson sees the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice tax system, formed by the saltwater nets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn"
Marines, of the 6,000 people who have deposited crowns on graves in Arlington
The first class of 19-year-old De'Angello Robinson made a seven-hour bus trip to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday mornings to deposit crowns on Veterans' tombs, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make their journey every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honour of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other States.
This year, the volunteers placed over 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battle Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the victims of United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given over $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
70-year-old Charleen Hunt of Westminster said she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emmiuffled in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples held their hands, carrying fresh pine crowns on gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Closely, he was planning silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhumed.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
People were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others thought to see the small black and white information cards, sunk into the wet soil for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She was part of Zanesfield, Ohio, and had taken eight hours to come to the tomb of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free to do... my son paid for it, she said.
"For a long time after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, affirmed the services of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on client projects such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to have access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and is followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to go to receive rewards but the authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of an American national may increase the tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "mild" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government move through concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can make the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or an employee's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press member of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a huge mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace Fidel, his sick elder brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused person is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries began to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities found an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five North Virginia men to Afghanistan in order to kill U.S. troops, saying that they hoped that this case would prove an important network of terrorist recruits who are looking for radicalized young men.
Investigators claimed to hunt a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after having discovered them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Having arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, al-Qaida home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistani secret services who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince Al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the banned mountains of the north-east becoming a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed themselves on the condition that they kept the anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations for entry into the camps of al-Qaida when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are questioned by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in determining the people to whom they trust.
Since the September 11, 2001, U.S. secret services have been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of custodians, refusing entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to US targets and their advertising value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, expert from the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to pay more attention in recent years in choosing people they accept because US secret services have become experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than follow his recruitment model than so many other people have followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen are demanding "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked in the streets, here on Saturday, demanding more important action on the climate of the negotiators working in the palace of the city's Bella Convention Center congresses.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists have lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
At this time when little has happened during the discussions on the United Nations-sponsored climate, thousands of activists have walked through the city, deploying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, saying 'The Earth says it has enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who stated that travelling to her mother's native country, Peru, opened her eyes to the disturbing problems facing the country due to the impact of the climate change already taking place."
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to put the word forward and to appeal to leaders from all over the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that they arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or owned pocket knives.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that they arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or owned pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep the anonymity due to its involvement in climate discussions, activists who wore black masks and clothing have lit up several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Within the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that demonstrators have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative for the climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, it is something I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking may seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and of the different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal tenacity differences between races
Last week's federal report on results in mathematics brought good news to public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more advanced in the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of the Progress of Education) are the persistent gap between the results of the Afro-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 white children (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased from three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, with only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average result of whites was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view over a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the teaching group director Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and awkward, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I do not leap joy for one or two won points, said Kwame R. Brown (Democrat Apparent), Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary ( elementary school).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the message of the test results is that the city's middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of the end classes of the elementary cycle and the beginning of college that did not integrate the foundations of reading earlier into their school course and are quite late from their peers.
Every day, the program of mathematics, for the Kindergarten (Maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they were put in place in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to continue to work to provide better interventions to these students at a lower level than the one in the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of NAEP are questioning whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for less successful schools in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at Berkeley University in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest districts of Washington.
Thus, this targeting may have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, wherever they are from, can be assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap in success was the duration of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, Janey said, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "start point" to get an increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, goes down and blinks a moment in the eyes of the white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other students from Grade 8 (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where school fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of a newly impressed student than enthusiastic.
That's where I'm going to study! she exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them toward the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? says she's a dreamer, when she was given the low ratio of law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit the children during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely raised for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who have left the high school where they have become parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a second-generation Hispanic in five-hundred-and-a-half-year high school education -- a remarkable success if one considers that both of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico and Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they open the way for the following generations to play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study batants claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
There are also many parents whose goals are high for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Menorant programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university -- in particular, if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support to these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of universities in Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared you) , it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize the preparation programs at the university that begin when low-income family students are middle school (school) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi Oil obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract significant oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by tens of years of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies went out with participation in only two of the 10 auction fields.
Seven American companies paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only one who put an auction has lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for field auctions in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies opened the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet information site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, supported by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability while U.S. military forces withdrew, have stopped American oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, the analysts say.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged due to their rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The largest American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who had strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and gave him their technical advice, left empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the State, has more contracts than other companies and has broken off with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesperson for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected companies for auctions made offers that were then compared to the bar rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan.
It seems that an American missile, having hit along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of the Al-Qaida operations this week, said Friday from the U.S. counter-spyping authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles thrown into their cars on Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchist tribal border of Pakistan.
They drove a white car, headed to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a Pakistani civilian secret services member, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority stated that local suspects precipitated on-site and quickly confiscated what remained of "totally undeclared bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of Al-Qaida military organizers leading the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities that wanted to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes within Pakistan's territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of Al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said that Somali had progressed rapidly in the Al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the American general public, but that does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major character of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The rate of CIA drone attacks has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a web site moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also impatience killing suspected informants, says the site.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdrew
The United Nations Special Envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate of allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said that he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States' timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and force the other Governments of NATO to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he was not resigning but that he would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
Representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is a citizen Italo-Switzerland who recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French person who previously directed United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of mass election fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that Galbraith's accusations -- which had been thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism with regard to the international observation of elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged United Nations leaders to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that he was not assigned to the mission to Afghanistan, saying that this would give them greater confidence in the way their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration at the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy UN employment regulations were hampering its ability to bring new talents.
The United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world's great powers were soon to impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a midwifery of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a one-week visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a breakthrough. ̈
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I've learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it's the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He stated that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their people would suffer enormously from these sanctions.
Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme in full conformity with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for the desperately necessary fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has made such an agreement, a way to build confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Iran has since shown itself to be far away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's tightening up to some of the international community's proposals for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set the deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to the proposals, before he turns to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "enhancing sanctions".
In a statement made in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed that it agreed to continue the talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, which was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Prime Minister of Iraq, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the Chiefs of the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates called on both parties to reduce potential conflict in order to avoid all delays in American plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops, from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the outstanding withdrawal. American authorities cited Gates saying in Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown up with advertising posters telling them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "A baby more, it is an additional grave".
They have so well learned that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
There are no seconds left, Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has an eight-month son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good toys and spoiled, called the "small emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in coastal rich cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "so old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is to date, without question, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who transgress this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities attributed it to the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced the abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women of a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys and girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they softened a lot of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched family planners and volunteers to meet couples, at their home, and to slip prospectus under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planner, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although managers in a rural town in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in couples' requests for a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The town of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still projected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the town of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to help their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly believe that the policy of the single child is a problem of rights, says Yang, a construction engineer whose woman is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
That's right, we're just stealing the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said that she only wanted a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and had the habit of everyone caring for us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it more firmly.
For couples working at two, middle-class, who lower the birth rate, it is said, it is necessary to be selfish even to succeed.
People 20 or 30 years old have grown up seeing their parents fighting in the early times of capitalist China and don't want to have themselves this lifestyle, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best nursery."
Most of her friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations -- has returned under the fires of the ramp Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden, in the coming years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases has highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it has clarified the path to be taken.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in the time-consuming negotiations, with over 100 leaders from all over the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
The text, drawn up by a United Nations special working group, does not state how many rich countries would give to the poor to support climate warming in the course and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process," said John Coequyt, Representative to Washington, Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, as the "full image".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries during the same period would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal changes occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States for Climate Negotiation rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by the industrialized countries, compared with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harsher to China than the Bush administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from the major developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei stated that the US lead negotiator, either "good sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not financially help China to fight climate warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the major world powers at stake, defects have appeared both in the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States complaining about their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major issuers responsible for their actions.
It is truly a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put pressure on obtaining a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants said that negotiations would lead to a minimum of political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unity, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the complete political process", in part by what they are now unified and that they demand emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in progress before the heads of governments reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister came down from their aircraft and precipitated in the Bella Center building to attend open-ended meetings and briefings in order to be able to make claims that will be discussed during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des congresses daily -- of guitar activists present night performances mocking countries that they believe, betray themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the Great Court," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the World Conservation Policy.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome of Monday
At 5:13 a.m., on Monday morning, a blow of whistle will go through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and would link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The small lost holes will become thriving suburban cities, the length of business travel will be much shorter, and the passage of the aircraft and the car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable planning battle and the fear of environmental hazards may hinder British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to carry out a feasibility report for the government, will make its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a high-speed network going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration in Y for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will split into two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is done, travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel to 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can work on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be required to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a flight to the trains, a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers refund the GBP 75,000 loan for the Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the principal member of Parliament Tory, paid the taxpayer a thousand pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency house.
The leader of the party who was endorsed by David Cameron to complain that the members of the parliament were "maintained", increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build a oak extension at his second house in Rutland.
The taxpayer had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of books per month.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the members' expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan said that the complaints could not be "lighter or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of the parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village of his district of Rutland - Melton.
The neighbouring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Commons, regarding his pre-debt arrangements.
The Committee found it innocent last month of any charges of non-compliance, following an investigation into its expenditures.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of his London property loan to his constituency that he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of the parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The variable standard interest rate RBS increased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as head of the ghost cabinet in September, after a covert journalist told him to film it stating that the members of the parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expense scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you must live "on budget" and you are treated as "of the m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of the parliament, millionaire since his former position as a oil dealer, began to have to explain his spending in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the office of charges that this could "be considered excessive".
An activist dug a pound-shaped hole in M Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of dealing with or developing or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It could not be clearer or simpler."
Faithful, come all see the calendar of Brighton's Advent
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Avent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for every day of December, using Noel songs as a theme.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 18:30, every day, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
Noel's songs so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unremunerated priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We wish religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Avent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we are trying to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police have conducted several hundred interrogations.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, about a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Conference on Climate, to reach an agreement that could enter into force by Friday, 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making "the political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the courthouse, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, broke windows with bolts and hammers, found a journalist from the PSA.
Anti-Smuggling police officers intervened immediately without cleaning up.
In total, the police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to the members of the Blacks Blocs, these ultraviolent clusters, which in particular illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were asked "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were always held on the street on Saturday night "low and kept in position despite extreme cold".
Parliamentary party, the courtroom, rather good child, took over the management of Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without looking to enter it.
A scene had been set to welcome the speakers, before a watch at the candles with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come in the car and in the midst of the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue sky waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Earth's Friends, which intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down the streets to claim ecological debt compensation for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, streams where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992, with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-globalist movement drew closer to environmental organizations.
The French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, planting bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred protesters gathered to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The Abkhazia separatist elected his president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
The Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called upon to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polls closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaze Election Commission.
The first interim results were to be announced on Saturday night at Sunday.
The five candidates in high school, including the outgoing president Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, who condemned the holding of the ballot.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "laws that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of the territory of 216,000 people, while the rest of the world considers it an illegal part of Georgia occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which resulted in several thousand deaths, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to the polling office at a school in Soukhumi, the capital, in a nice white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the president in this region to the sumptuous landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district leader, Beslan Archba, has reserved a warm welcome for Russian officials who have come to monitor the conduct of the poll.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, said during a small ceremony, alluding to the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, answered by lifting a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims not to support the current power or opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second tour must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: events in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the live one, have interviewed nearly 700 people on the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about a hundred thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliamentary party, the courtroom, generally good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without looking to enter it.
A scene had been set to welcome the speakers, before a watch at the candles with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the courthouse left, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, fully dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke windows, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emission police soon surrounded them and intervened without any housekeeping, throwing several of them on the ground.
The police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were primarily members of the Blacks Blocs, these ultraviolent groups that had illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a paving and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the interrogation of about 20 people, according to the police.
At the eye we had extremist groups, warned the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of the order turned in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came in and out of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue sky waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Earth's Friends, which intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down the streets to claim ecological debt compensation for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, told AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between fighting against climate warming and fighting for another world".
The Oxfam organization mobilized several personalities, including Danish mannequin Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, showed off, dressed in red and bubbling bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Filipino capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of a few hundred protesters also took place to call for action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The age-old history of the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to appear in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "enforced" from the reform of the general school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminals.
Now, first-time students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "you have to get out of hypocrisy" because, he says, "the S is no longer a scientific course" but "in large, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain S sub-liners, he continues, but still emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals in the absence of the history-geography in terminal in the technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in Humanity revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) disapproved of the government's project to remove the mandatory history-geography teaching in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and some right-wing elected.
On the other hand, the minister added that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrificing the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year, which will deal with their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test that will deal with their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also follow courses in situation during the year of M2 and will then be a first year in front of students as trainee teachers.
If you add all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence before the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist at the National Education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "by 2012".
At Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen Summit: it was the challenge of Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street's Normal High School.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, of fifteen minutes each, filmed and opened to the public, found an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that caught people and gave them the desire to know more, explained on the margins of the 22-year-old Edouard Hanezo conference, one of the organizers of this day who took his name from the one given by the students to the fish from the school basin.
Twenty actors were selected from among the experts of their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
With regard to climate warming, "hours can be talked about, but key objectives can also be discussed in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but using graphics, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
The videos drawn from these conferences will be posted online on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays of payments: anger from prison guards, planned actions
Prison supervisor unions called on Friday for "general mobility" to require the end-of-year holidays to be paid for the additional premiums and hours of which the payment was delayed in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2 union of supervisors) has asked staff who will not be in service to manifest themselves in front of the correctional institutions on Tuesday morning and "block them", to "denominate the flight of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "gather in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", judging "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "additional hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first Union of Superintendents, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilisation ... to raise discontent and anger".
The Prison Administration Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts of staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I asked the head of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime did not occur in the future, she added.
The December pay will therefore be small, except for management staff receiving the famous functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have good backs".
This is a pure scandal, the interregional FO union of Marseilles has been indignified, announcing its decision to boycott to a new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those in October are not regularized in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increased without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to bear the burden of personnel, says Bordeaux's CGT penitentiary.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less crowded than others.
But in any case the account is not there, the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "cuter tricks" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas as a family at the White House, has entrusted to the "papesis" of the little Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things nicer than those I receive."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on the ABC channel on Sunday night, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate their new and prestigious birthday celebrations in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be on the side.
Father Noël also loves Bo, so said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "certainly" a gift, according to excerpts from the broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama fell out against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "Of course not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she takinized the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to give up before responding with humor by displaying the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?".
During this one-hour show, at the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous entertainer who was a fierce support from Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama evoked a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his father Kenyan rarely saw offered to him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father came to see us for Christmas and when he gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
It wasn't much later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday resumed, RTL claims he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to important "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reopened on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors had found that the "lesions resulting from the operation" of the discal hernia suffered in Paris on 26 November, told Paris its press service, stating that these injuries had "required a repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, sought to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the last singer's tour, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pangs and complications".
It's only in 48 hours that we'll have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
Interviewed by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Park Monceau International Clinic for this discal hernia.
The intervention, programmed for several days had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This was not available on Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for a follow-up infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass," but assured himself not to be "concerned" for the rocker, who is "a beater".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a mess because it took 12 hours to fly after such an operation, it's not playable, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, was trying to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endigated".
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laetitia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, at the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been performed with a "small colon cancer", and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been well commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulty of the singer moving on stage.
By mid-November, his surroundings had even denied a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet first on its fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalled at the Worlds-2009 in large basins, found on Thursday an international title on a distance that it especially cares about, the 50 m free swimming, during the Euro-2009 in small basins in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a transfer.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, which drew on the record of the world of 50 m free, of which it holds the brand in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen swimming distances, the free 50 m, was the 28-year-old French who imposed himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet advanced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in the event, I said that if the world record was at my disposal, I would try.
Like Bousquet, almost all of the swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
Originally 238 records from the world since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations has not been used this time at the German Paul Biedermann, a double champion of the world in large basins this summer in Rome, records of the world to the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the brand he owns over 400 m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't take that race to heart.
I knew I couldn't make a record of the world this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola adjué 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded on Thursday, $1.5 million, clearly above his estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This panel before two meters long on 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satires and Bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
He was sold out of a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have the most expensive up to now, told the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola is only a few days away.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it a part of his bath in his Parisian particular hotel, and in Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to the power of the Pétain Marshal.
It was a shadow zone of about fifty years.
When searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Térèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempts of aborted departure from Honduras to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the former President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who had been denied a safe conduct by the Putschist government.
For the moment, after a night phone conversation with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
Arrived on Wednesday in Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya, the Mexican Government's plane departed to its place of origin, according to a source of the Migration Branch.
The Puschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "get out" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a safe haven.
But the President-in-Office refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as an invited Head of State.
The Putschist government "has experienced a new failure by wanting me to give up my responsibility (...), they wanted me to resign," said Mr. Zelaya on the Globo radio, on which he has often expressed himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing a few agreements the president decho, refugee at the Embassy of Brazil of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's Embassy has submitted us a request except for driving, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain asylum applications, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, to the Honduran radio NRN.
I do not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to be made as President of the Honduran people, he had emphasized.
The rumors of Mr. Zelaya's departure had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the president dechu, who had come to gather around the Embassy of Brazil, where the military had strengthened their seats.
Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had come close to the Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, had been overturned on 28 June, on the day he held a popular consultation to prepare his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out, he will be arrested to respond to the crime of "strong treason" whose prosecution of justice, according to the putschist government.
The Puschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial U.S. election but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against the return of Mr. Zelaya to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, the US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with US trade balance figures reflecting the resumption of both the US and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index amounted to 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different sides of the economy, Lindsey Piegza, of the FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, it has temperate, believing that the market was focused on "the glass half full."
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the American trade balance, "which shows that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit declined in October from 7.6% to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected the opposite of a growth of the deficit.
As well as the imports that exports have increased.
The great news is the growth in the volumes of trade, in particular for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners in the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, the new unemployment registrations in the United States rose against all expectations last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest of a year," said Scott Marcoueller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday evening and that of the 30-year-old to 4.492% on the day before.
Cuba: hundreds of supporters of power consist of "White Ladies"
A few hundred Cuban supporters made up the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on Thursday for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Forty-year-old women, married or close to political prisoners, were consummated on the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched to the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP found.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaires!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" were scanning, the uplifted fist, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came "to ensure their protection".
The night before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Hawaiian neighbourhood of the Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to manifest themselves on Thursday for the international human rights day were, they, called on by civilian police, found an AFP journalist.
The police force the dissidents who were consummated by government supporters in civilian vehicles, according to the journalist.
Interviews of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "White Ladies" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to dissidentity, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under locks.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" to the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
At a very rare point, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against counter-revolutionaries.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of encroaching on rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced kill an octogene in the knife and injured 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-tailed soldier killed an eight-year-old and injured five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influx, on Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have struck with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, one octogene in or before a pharmacy of the 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Seriously injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to a manager of the Alliance Police Union, died in the hospital after his injuries.
In or before this same pharmacy, he then took a couple, the woman of whom was pregnant.
The husband, aged 30 years, interfered and was injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogeneary died.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs being apparently affected, depending on police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and would have been hospitalized "in shock" according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled to the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
It would have injured two passersby, apparently at random: a 30-year-old and a quadrant, the latter roughly.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two knifes of slaughter that he was carrying in the cross behind his back, explained in place a head of the Alliance union in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, according to testimony collected by the PSA, tried to control the forced servant.
I saw a 30-year-old guy with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept her.
They didn't get there because the guy was rough, brought Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Always boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No.61, two municipal police officers, their leaders, tried to intercept the armed man and were wounded by punching, according to police sources.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers came and told me there was someone injured outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, put him in a security position, and I saw a very important wound to the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of about thirty years was injured with knife stroke.
They were the National Police personnel who arrested the man without identity papers.
Nanterre's Public Prosecutor's Office had before the investigation the Department of Judicial Police of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The coroner was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not exclude him from being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all the forced in this species whose forces are breaking up under the effect of the action."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the abandonment of prosecutions
Lawyer Roman Polanski once again called in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), for the abandonment of prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a matter of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California with serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I demand the abandonment of the charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who died since -- would have discussed, before rendering his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural failure.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), of the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lies" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court would refuse to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argumentary.
The prosecution reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski would appear in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
The Deputy Prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be here to appear at the hearing."
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to flee?, Mrs. Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "asks for favor in the court, while disregarding her authority."
One of the three judges -- who now has 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to the flight".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the abandonment of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
The victim's lawyer, Samantha Geimer, also called for, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound in the Polanski case, she added: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad chalet, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends undirected, frozen by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended up undirected Friday, in a market between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Avarage rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while Nasdaq, with technological dominance, abandoned 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, Mace Blicxilver said, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchanges has become very low and I think it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve market opinion on the robustness of economic recovery", summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second month of rowing and much more than expected.
In addition, the confidence of US consumers increased significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes have been hampered by a further increase in the dollar, which has been in the euro for two months, which "passes down into sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and the return to 30-year-olds to 4.497% on the day before.
Miss Monde's election again in South Africa
After a month's journey through South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss Monde prepare to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already booked their tickets for the half-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Sports Miss or Miss top model during their African stay.
This was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I've seen lots of things and experienced so much!, Miss Sierra Leone calls herself.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17h00 (15h00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to restore my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova points out in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian girl, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and rediscovering the "scapes to cut breath in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood stars.
It is the dream of every woman being crowned the most beautiful in the world but it is nothing but appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, Miss Inde launches with a big smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will show up in traditional costume and of course in swimwear.
The show will be animated by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a committee member of Miss Monde Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates made a safari last year, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time on a bike, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma who held their hands.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the draw in the Cape (southwest) for the June 2010 World Football Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been with people I never thought I could approach.
I'm definitely going back for the 2010 World Cup, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he had to go to his father's hair in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's happening very well, told the press David Hallyday at his departure from the plane that drove him from Paris shortly after 1300 locals (2100 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured him he was going to go "very fast" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a consequent infection to the operation of a discile hernia in Paris on November 26th.
The singer was "placed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for a consequential infection to the operation of hernia discale on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reopened on Wednesday night to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade was educated to attend a school show, observed a photographer of the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and traumatic surgery at the Hospital de la Pitié-Salpêtriere, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go to Los Angeles on Monday to the singer.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who performed the singer on 26 November at the Monceau International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outlawed, said Mr. Camus.
I've heard about a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday was "part too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip, and it amazed me, as I had two discal hernies myself, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "part without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to rejuvenate a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a sulphide-reputy doctor, convicted on several occasions by justice, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the order of the Médecins, accused him of being "a man without scruples" who continued "regularly" before the Council of Orders, and who is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well conducted" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not need the pose of a drain," he added.
In any event, the singer's tour, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a tour of 8 January (at Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and sum of the New Centre no longer using its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardien Party, while holding him back from using it on no support, subject to judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF century, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy before the NC National Council on Saturday.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (formerly NC-UMP) who claimed ownership of the UDF mark for having been the first to deposit it to the National Institute for Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF Association's office, controlled by friends of François Bayrou who do not hear to let themselves get out, came out of his silence to set up the Minister and the Member of Parliament, no longer using the seal and transmitting the property of the trade mark to them, subject to judicial prosecution.
You have multiplied the statements in recent days that you are going to propose to your political movement to +reprere+ the UDF century, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it best to track on your militant material and on your site's guard page, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, the slogan + the UDF of today+, also found the mail signatories.
As you do not know, you do not have the right to use this label, explains the UDF office that is in the process of initiating the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium and of (on) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (la) mark to his legitimate rights".
If you did not do so, the courts would be required to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, the signatories would be prevented.
In their mail, they state that the UDF "is a full political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP".
In their view, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the latest UDF congress in 2007 voted on its three-year membership of MoDem and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "when he filed the mark", he was not "more adherent to the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
He was scandalously and fraudulently benefiting from the abscess of deposit of the UDF acronym to do so on his behalf.
This indelicacy is becoming a crime, they denounce, before ironing on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than trying to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, she took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogeneaire for the spoiler of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his pictures of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375,000 euros of fines.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter broke up while holding the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be carried out collaboratively by three doctors.
L'Oréal's principal heir and shareholder has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office at the time of the investigation.
The designated physicians will have to report by 10 March 2010 in particular if Liliane Bettencourt has been in a weak state and at what time.
I think she's going to submit.
I'm going to talk to him about it, he said at the hearing that Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady that we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's unique daughter has been prosecuting a criminal case against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist, all of which she accuses of having spent years of her mother's weakness in obtaining a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' arguments sometimes turned to the great family breakdown Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "You may explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since she got married."
For its part, the National Prosecutor of Nanterre once again felt that the complainant was not entitled to act, especially since a guardian judge refused to grant his application for a judicial protection procedure for his mother in recent days.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the public ministry representative Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial was held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than ten years, the attitude of managing large companies towards their employees has reminded them of the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to make employees join "values" determined as they once were, to impose on consumers the products thought by the factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has given the procurement strategies to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preference factors comes back regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the company's intellectual functions, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment from employees that authoritarian management revenues are totally contrary.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to put the employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as the customer.
The full usefulness of internal opinion investigations
Internal opinion surveys – such as Orange's questionnaire to its employees - will encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many diversions, to do priority... what it has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old Behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the "neurossciences" of the United States and widely disseminated, in their own sense, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the executives' engagement, a recent survey of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr comforts leaders in a position of mechanical governance, inadequate to the world of today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses, requires the adoption of a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists in incorporating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of achieving some of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
Currently, only motivational analysis studies adopt this concept of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a pre-determined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life plans.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and restore their management of human resources "to the place".
They thus create a land conducive to the concerted development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: The "Just War" is worth praise to the right in Obama
On Friday, the American right-wing praised the speech given last night in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the US enemies.
The Conservatives, who had cut the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former vice president's candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the right wing of the Republican Party, in the USA Today daily, adding that she herself has addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that have just been published.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over there, she thought.
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done very good work in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this historic speech, said Mr.Gingrich, interviewed during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a potential candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen "a president on the left" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former pen converts to Washington Post, Obama said "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as "a citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Mr.Gerson.
Among the rare to the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era faucon, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "tern, ampoule and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich warned that Barack Obama justified the use of force.
When war is enveloped in the notion of justice, the massacre of innocents can easily be justified, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained commendable at the President's seat.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was prematured to Mr. Obama, qualified his address as "superproduction" even for a known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the daily Californian fires.
Obama "spoke the discourse that it was necessary," said the New York Times, judging him as "both dark and uplifting."
Routes: Three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three negotiating-marathon sessions, the road unions and TLF, the sole employer organization to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening to end the strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" of this agreement, after several negotiations, started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators left on Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And the same thing as three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) had shut the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting started at 11 a.m. to make everyone agree and the text is signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "he was concerned that he would be disrupting the holidays of the end of years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
At the hourly rate, for the low wages, we are going from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It's not much, but we're leaving very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we're going to give orders to our militants that there are no blockades, no blockades from the recovery centres.
But we can always have a few hardy people who aren't happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, praised "a good deal", even though it was "hard to grant increases on high wages in view of the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be around 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised "historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revalorization of travel costs of 3%, and the holding of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will include addressing the question of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, voted on Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote in the same way.
TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply first to companies that are members of this organization, and secondly to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will take place "in the shortest possible time", said Mr. Bussereau.
Opposition from employers can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "Dupe Market", as the EUR 100 million "had already been pledged to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the next-reveal diners, Unostra deplored.
For the Other, the agreement is likely "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, dissatisfied trade unions of RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A, France's largest urban transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday to the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP leadership left them on their hunger as to their demand for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important pre-Christmas shopping weekend, there will be trains only between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to a train on two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallery, which waits for 200,000 customers every day, was delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve large stores."
The A RER across the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The short RATP section of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train out of two circled at peak hours, and almost no copper in hollow hours, as expected.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Francilians were organized.
In the early morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially due to the absence of colleges and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not know about saturation, said the SNCF, which had provided an officer and law enforcement framework.
The RER A operated by the SNCF either from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare station to reach the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "magres" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, which requires a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its parentheses premium proposals, pointed out the CGT, stressing that management "was not sure to solve a problem when road and SNCF were done".
A new meeting is planned on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," the RATP specified.
This also made the unions say that the company "was mocking the weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee in Paris.
It was then that the management, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in the interest of restlessness" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions request a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euro variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to millions daily of travellers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of their careers, fall from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for broken hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurde party, a heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court declared on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurd party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which had just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "framework of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unit," the President of the Haism Kiliç Court told the press at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes were required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr. Kilicç, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Number of observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the rebels of the PKK.
The party, however, ensures that it has no "organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to cut Kurds' support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could result in a surge in tensions in the south-eastern Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Upon the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the largest town in the southeast populated by Kurds.
The forces of the order pulled from the lacrymogenic grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with leaves.
A hundred people have also shown in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the Justice decision was going to "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this question (kurde, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed by principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not resolve anything, said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedoes of the government's democratic openness, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, one can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the Head of Road Deployment and Sanding Service (FES) makes it clear that it is not to fool citizens.
It's just so that agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn how to master them.
And according to meteorologists, this could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and ice.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as he snowed on the city of Frankfurt and that temperatures descended below zero, large sand vehicles traveled 20 main routes (called itineraries A) .
This includes streets with great circulation, main arteries, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and roads are also included, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers start their service at three in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road shall be salted with a road fondant that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the EDF service starts at 3 am in the morning "in order for roads to be cleared when daily migration begins."
There or it gets harder, it's when the snow falls at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, we are told the responsible for the decommissioning and sanding of the roads "because no car is willing to let the salage vehicles pass."
Then, if it no longer snows, we deal with access roads and dessert routes - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Sideways and lateral streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger is well aware that this is still causing some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES Pedestrian Team is on its way to prioritize the areas deemed dangerous and the crossings.
As for cyclable tracks, the EDF services generally cannot handle this.
Mr. Brauburger said there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the status of bridges between 22 and 4h30 hours.
As the verglas forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also make use of this special service in cases of need.
They were bluffing with dinosaurs.
The Tawa foundae resembled the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipede was about 2 meters long for 1,50m tall, its posterior limbs were powerful, its long skull was filled with sharp and curving teeth, its short arms ended with scarves and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt's report from Texas University in Austin and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the emerging land of the supercontinent, the Pangee and was located toward the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa illuminates the evolution of the first dinosaurs of a new day.
In fact, it teaches us about the parenting, distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt began searches with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch website north of New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Utah Natural History Museum and member of the search team tells that he sometimes arrived to find a dozen bones in one day what is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly found that part of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers baptized her by the name of Tawa according to the word of the Indians Hopi for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a completely exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bone.
All Paleontology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, however, he states that it allows to confirm certain theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth approximately 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making the classification of the first dinosaurs very difficult.
The experts wonder, among other things, at what time the saurians were divided into three major evolution groups: theopods (carnivores) that include the tyrannosaurus and the cyclocyraptor that appeared later and of which the birds, sauropods, quadrupeds in the long neck, and those that are related to them and the ornithischi herbivores of which species such as triceratops and stegosaure are part.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropods .
This species has an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, S. Nesbitt said.
Researchers found clues to suggest that Tawa found small airbags in its skull-level bones, as well as birds that are the descendants of the theorems.
These small air pockets facilitate bird breathing compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa finding, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest airbags with small airbags in its bones.
As the related line of immense sauropods also possessed airbags and a light bone, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the sauriens had appeared there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all of the emerging lands that formed the supercontinent of the Pangee.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists has also discovered the remains of two other theorems that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advance researchers.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn says that there is an even older species, the sileaure, which lived in current Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a mistaken vision because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while practically none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how the dinosaurs became the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era while they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and with many other sauriens.
Towards the end of the Trias the dinosaurs were spread across the globe, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between Trias and Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There could have been a massive extinction at which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or, as a result, dinosaurs were better suited and could have eliminated competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorite meteorite to the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which since then lived in the shadow had been mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are teachers at the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
There are those of course officers at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
Evacuation by the casino police at the J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with protest students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they hide the police intervention requested by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the president of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in strike after walls and works of art were barboiled with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories felt that the degradation did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commander against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable achievement" to freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to "legitimize and criminalize the protest" and tries to make the reasons for mobilization forgotten.
The University Steering Committee was thus excluded from the discussions that would be essential.
Course officers require immediate suspension of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the deterioration.
Legitimation of protests
Young people from the Verdi Service Sector Union and the German Confederation of Syndicates (DGB) show solidarity with students.
The protests are merely the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary of the young people of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the sites is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the Aksuelle Stunde television show.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said the CDU Member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beirut.
Parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (Die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students' arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The Party La Gauche has tabled a motion which encloses the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime a place to search for secret arms under strict supervision.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
There are important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, a place for francoforce sciences – with academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and on Wednesday, the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
The signatories were Moscow's vice-mare Juri Rosljak and  Zelenograd's Anatoly Smmov Prefect for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, project section leader for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet institutes and research companies.
It is located at the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnique, the big companies Sistronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for armament research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centres are implanted.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The size of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the sinking of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, into a chaos desperate for ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The line-head stations, with tracks ending in the middle of town, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that effected the brake sabotage of modern rail traffic because it took a lot of time to move the locomotives from the back forward.
Arrived, short stop, departure – that's what to do.
That's why the line-head stations must disappear: Frankfurt and Munich.
Also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is about halfway to the Trans-European Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from which the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to smuggle the station into the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the line-head stations no longer pose real entry and exit problems since there are modern trains, reversible with highways and pilot car at both ends.
However, we are now launching Stuttgart 21 next to the new route of the intercity line towards Ulm.
Regional and community policies carried it out.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who costs the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe in the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The passage station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people to whom it was attributed - and it is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening the traffic of goods because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, does not fit the freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, is indirectly related to many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be included in the Souabe project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade, this money will be missing for other points of joining and bulking in the network.
The list of all sixty major projects is listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the 180-kilometre Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a slow rate.
It would be very urgent to put a deep support here on the fungus.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake soap.
The route to the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international goods traffic, which is in the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility to appeal the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Tribunal concerning the ban on air flights at night.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had entrusted experts with the legal review of the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the ban on night flights in the case or the construction project of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
The authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 23 and 5 hours in the morning, as envisaged by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nocturnal air injuries.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this deadline and attempts to pressure the representative of the Government to appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel parliamentary group invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections, which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be conditioned as a total failure to a given word.
It is extremely difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir by alluding to the election slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's complaints that the Government of the Land is still trying to authorize night flights by using "advocacy and roubles".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely flawed.
U.S. banks refund the aid allocated
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, stem from their ties towards the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (over €30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp life plan.
CNBC's American television channel revealed in a report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to rid themselves of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of the bonuses allocated to the managers and the regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched an increase in capital by selling securities to investors that paid it $19 billion in fresh money.
The remainder of the sum comes from bank funds that are well filled through the sale of several branches from other sectors.
On Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America specifically thanked the U.S. taxpayers: the injection of capital greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by buying the Merrill Lynch investment bank as high as financial torment.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money on the financial markets in order to free itself from the government's guardianship.
As a result, the US bank could launch a capital increase of $20 billion on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain citing the banking community.
The Citigroup spokesman did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally everything happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the limoage of the current post of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German chain ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs ZDF's Berlin edition, was the great favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it also seems that there was a desire not to further harm the ZDF steward Markus Schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who was Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 Commission members on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council supported Brender's re-election and 7 others voted against. Brender's vote-out was a well-predictable failure for Schächter.
In fact, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already heard several weeks before the vote, did not want to return Brender to his position.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief by referring to the fact that the rate of listening to the ZDF's information broadcasts had been lowered under Brender.
That is why protests still took place, almost until the vote, flogging the growing political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had joined the debate and believed that Koch's approach was anti-constitutional.
But that would have been of no use.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, teaching and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhenania-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national newspaper).
In 1983 he became a editor at the ZDF first in the newspaper "heute-journal" (present-day newspaper).
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the associate of the editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was chief and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (a bimonthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin edition.
After Brender's abuse, while he had just been elected a year's journalist by the magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent to the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, stated last week that the Länders should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the employer's proposals could not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor had skillfully acted with the Board of Directors by critiqueting the commission with vehemenity in his decision to limoger Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as could the Board of Directors elect it without being suspected of placing a political partisan in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal on the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Part success for students: After a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliant: during a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the rectors conference, an agreement was developed that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination must enable the study module to be completed.
In addition, the workload will need to be recognised to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also undertook to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master branches.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of Länder and the rectors of universities have constantly spoken the expression in fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be completed by a single examination", one can read in a document of thirty pages on future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Board, states that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, we should be able to stop the uproots, which had a significant impact on studyability.
The "studyability" should also be the crucial criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if we cannot avoid this feeling of suffocation that we sometimes feel in the course selection.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the possibility and flexibility to enable and promote the personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that all cycles will have been reviewed in 2015.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to focus on agencies so that programs are not too busy and the review regime is not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already heard with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
To date, Rhine-Palatinate is the only Land to have agreed to provide more means for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs to strengthen educational guidance offices as well as review offices and the service of international relations
The Länders and universities are planning a budget of EUR 10 million for this purpose.
In early 2010, the Government wishes to present an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
As a result, only one exam will be required to close his studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, and it is necessary to be able to guarantee the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "study" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of conditions for studies in the country.
Decisions were appreciated but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students indicated that he would like to see the organization of education policy no longer going on in the future "under the closed doors" of the Ministers and rectors of universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as individuals should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education were supported by the Chair of the delegates of the rector conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us" said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the education and science union (GEW) decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. He demands the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länders ensure today's Bachelor students, that there will be enough places tomorrow for Master studies and study conditions as good as possible.
The Länders must therefore hire more officers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education have not referred to the possibility of lightening access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is through these words "Arrival to Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by poet Werner Söllner, in which he theatizes in bribs of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident who has arrived in Germany who has won freedom but has at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first a German and English teacher in Bucharest and then a collection manager in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received several literary awards; in 1993 he held the chair highly coveted of poetry from Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a convention in Munich, the theme of which was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deformed mirror of your safety records".
A visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized his fellow German-Roman writers as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer who had collaborated as an informer of the security policy.
Söllner received the German language price in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The recruitment tests had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, therefore, concluded Söllner "someone who has not been able to resist security intimidation tests."
Poet Werner Söllner is informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honouring of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his distinguished exemplary literary writings with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the abyss and the bass of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victims.
In his own security file, IM Walter played a role, ensures the specialist of literature Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He could have taken it out of all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The way in which Söllner made his statement and before this public was unexpected, however, the absence of a former dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had previously written Herta Müller in July in the "Die Zeit" newspaper, after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have speculated and sometimes guessed what real names were last hiding the names of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
On the contrary, Germany where, in the meantime, consulting the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the security records is still very confusing.
A systematic clarification has been constantly counterbalanced and restrained in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was established to work on the assimilation of the security archives (CNSAS) but the return of the files has rather lag since.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines archive management.
The influence of former security members in Romania is still very large, and is confirmed by the interview of a former security officer of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, expresses himself in a three-way manner with regard to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and we had finally questioned her only once.
The infamous power thought could express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many ineligible questions are associated with the Söllner case as they occur so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why is it now? Who has been stripped? The weighted reaction of the auditors, with Söllner's consent, lets hope that the continuation of this chapter will be more defined by a thirst for knowing that by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received yesterday the Nobel Prize, is more than a footnote.
Troultes at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived there, shot at four pins coming right from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross rode less than a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier at hand.
The man, whose bald skull drew attention, let himself be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our fifty-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he didn't drink alcohol and he wasn't drunk with happiness either.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because now it's gonna start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just committed three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth finish", that is, in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. This will be a brutal fight not to return.
The "great work" awaits us on Sunday.
Here, it is about repeating to Mainz the results of the daily league of champions.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have remade the surface after the three shipping goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lot draw
The eighth final finish of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ match return 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be released on December 18th in Nyon.
The joy of the entrance to the fulminant function of the successor of Babbel was therefore moderate.
And joy was not moderate only in those who had been lucky, who had transmitted to the professionals of Stuttgart destabilized, a smooth motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I've been seeing the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "smoker of souls" – Gross - the recipe for the success that sounded so well that it did no more effect with the Babbel healer.
He triggered a certain magic, conna Jens Lehmann - partisan of Babbel -, "in the football when there is a new impulse there is sometimes something that we would never have believed possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of pause for injury, advances to the rank of the best player thanks to her dynamism, tries to describe the " phenomena" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It's someone who moves to action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the lead yet, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated defence and weakens Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before having had a bad wake at Leverkusen four days later with the 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the season's objectives but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't had a hard time yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th birthday did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, was from the events of the weekend that a television interview by the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann rebounded just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, against Heldt, in response to Lehmann's acerbate criticism.
He had accused the management of style weakness and said that he had decided to change his coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann also saw as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the matches had been abolished.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure egoism" behind Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for the life of these two quadrogens.
In any case, they agreed for the rest, that without the prior work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong sport and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in the success" retorting Heldt and Lehmann as a choir – and even the man in the plastic bag aquiesça.
World heavyweight championship
Hot combat in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, Ukrainian defended its title as a world champion of heavy weights according to the WBC federation version.
To the unanimity of the judges he imposed himself on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains its title as a world champion of heavy weights.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night, the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the same time as the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defended his title with honour since his show comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had twice won the World Champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed the KO so much awaited.
Klitschko, out 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, has twice confessed his defeat for injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, by its left against it.
Johnson, 11 centimeters smaller who, prior to the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's beatings, thus preventing Klitschko from engaging in his right-winging fight.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried mostly to pass the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and in gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, he has exceeded the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital of Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko the traitor of "vician zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the harvest Friday, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by causing him to fall off his nose sunglasses "in order to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko re-engaged in his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a period of almost four years, he had beaten at the time Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had had previously left without a fight.
This year, defending his title as a champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola from the USA.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was due in September.
It would appear that his promotion company is now planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affaire.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (Die Linke) request explanations from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following consideration of the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formed a contravention" on the deadly strike of two tank trucks last September, said the head of the Greens Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the ARD Chain information broadcast "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to the full disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr. Gutenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the fragpe was in reality, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two major Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 persons were killed or injured during the US air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday, to speak out as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and to reveal what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Party Renate Künast are of the view that Ms. Angela Merkel must make clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan federal government's policy if the chancellery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government's spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery has in no way influenced the military intervention in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, more and more voices were being made to express doubts about the real reasons why Inspector-General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert referred to by the ministry.
According to the information in the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Gutenberg about the attack of tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
The two senior officials, however, indicated that they had informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a military police report.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have requested a clarification of the facts in a mail.
Up to now, it has not received a response
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, which was to become the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dream
Some see, wake up, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is nothing but the boundaries between imagination and reality in the case of mental patients, or under the effect of drugs.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything goes very well.
When we are immersed in our dark rooms, we can easily drift to the deepest dreams and ghosts.
However, the one who, awake, makes the experience of a state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices appear only in the case of psychiatric patients or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but which sometimes incites the limits between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called vision, to the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect are different, the visions of the Hildegard von Bingen mystics, the drug experiments of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - in the first place dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achethylcholine - breaks down and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earth's attraction force no longer has power over the person.
From antiquity, philosophers and physicians have always considered the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T becomes the character of a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions with the colors created.
Earth attraction has no more power over it, it plans for the root of the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him creatures of devil fins, grinning, bloody mouth, showing their teeth.
They pursue him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, feel pain throughout the body.
Toning voices, foul, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo chain, in fact a loop and the hook attached to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He climbs on a buffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop's off.
That this is a lesson for you, they raise their voices in a choir to pull out the tympan. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychosis, the last two-year-old, the first 20-year-old.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, it is also maniac-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned how to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
During psychosis, I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most frequent disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which makes them suffer from hallucinations, mégalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the consciousness is drowned under the sensations.
Just like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and ghosts resulting from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the CHU Psychiatry Department of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrene is at the heart of the situation, with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it is in a passive role, it is like in a dream, surmounted by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why schizophrene often feels threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility of adjusting reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in his life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place within a real framework.
Why our brain makes this kind of cabrioles, it's always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to momentarily losing the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have severe brain damage.
Neuronal maturation of the brain is assumed to be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the abnormality of the neuronal system occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience may be a psychotic trigger, if there is a predisposition.
Likewise, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms up.
What's crazy, we're told by Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of viewpoint.
Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and the phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Mind".
Hallucinations are part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychosis but also of an impressive number of other diseases.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, as well as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently cooled; when our brain heats but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like a brain injury or a psychosis.
But also lack of stimuli, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants recognize that they have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklembourg-Pomerania before and going to high school.
A girl makes it normal for me to say it.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, a young boy, thin, long-haired, sends the word to him.
When she answers her friends, they look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's certain.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy just like she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this nice young guy.
I'm crazy, she asks sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally scary.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is clearly explaining equations in the table.
At night the apparitions are generally scary.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and well too late, she cannot often make the distinction if she is awake or already dreaming, if the images she sees, the smiling faces or the young girl with bloody laces on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it either to her parents or to her friends, they'd take it for a fool.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her berry last year and she lived with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Folly is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is great that he has hallucinations after a certain time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., a single girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned when she was 13 years old that the man she called Dad, since she was at the age of thinking, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Each experience", says Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form into the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, unfortunately, there is a quick tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease that also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called omiroid, a particular form of change of consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroid vecus are very complex semi-resurrections that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that they cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy, who experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that harms his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an organizational capacity that is given to us men, not to shade in the absence of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, a historian of art also describes his uniroided experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old, at the time when his consciousness left for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during that time, his body was ordered to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world that he has created of all pieces, visits to foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man alluded to in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his hair watching his health.
He lives at an average age among the nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle that takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It completely absorbs in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these inland trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, writing, describing what he has lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than real life.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the honoroid delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of the external reality are even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years of age, the children will follow up with the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to recapture the press group, he said to the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, editor Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
Both children will inherit at age 27 and are firmly determined to integrate society, Hubert Burda said, 69, in Spiegel.
All details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
They will also need to see if they are capable of it.
It is not possible to impose its children on 7500 employees without knowing if they have the ability to handle it.
This would demolition children as well as the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first and foremost responsible for the technology sector.
He then deals with the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time this is not a family member who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children were 19 and 17 respectively, his son Felix, who would have died today 42 years ago, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have been left to train by a bulimia of capital, which have made enormous unfortunate speculations by thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I don't see myself in the country's role as a preceptor as it could be Springer and I don't intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full beauty
Everything you can desire, in matters of beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is the goal that could have been set by El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious hints such as Hedonai, laser hair specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatments rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a diet radius, with in particular a tea salon, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a cup of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms, where the most innovative face, body and hydrotherapy are available.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of customers, offering them fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly carry out our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after having our body worked, we want to go through the hair salon, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, lightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10h to 22h.
Miscellaneous take-offs
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the decollete, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to consider.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated take-off. This is not very advised.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with the electric car
The Endesa electric company, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, created the "LIVE Bureau".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will establish mobility agreements, taking steps, coordinating, providing grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, gather the views and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville come to join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, within the framework of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the construction of the electric car.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is involved in the promotion of the electric car.
The company is participating in European standardisation groups and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero glimpses "a future of tranquility" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, has "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the Government President's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the automotive competitiveness plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Plan for the Automobile Sector (IPA), devoted EUR 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero has also focused on government demand support measures, in alluding to Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the Chairman, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "strong increase" of registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Exhibition of Car Collection, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pavilón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and car collections, but you will also find items in ClassicAuto Madrid of all kinds related to the engine world.
For example, in the pavilion exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, complements, magazines, thumbnails, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will bring the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Santas de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Classics, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Exterior aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this exhibition will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with car and collection motorcycles will also take place on a circuit arranged outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sport spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated the engine stop and start system, i-Stop, which, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150-horse petrol engine 2.0.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, it appears that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheel is also particularly pleasant.
By continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that as well the Mazda3 that the Civic, both Japanese, contrasts with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Gulf of Volkswagen, that they all want to overcome.
By continuing with the habitat, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to this, a large box is a regular form.
The engine's automatic shutdown and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre petrol engine and 150 horses and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its benefits and the control of its consumption.
Although the most requested Mazda3 are the diesel models, those that do not make a lot of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, that is, the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the track change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, the independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the audio bluetooth, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional EUR 1,500, includes, among other elements, two-way adaptable lights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It shows in particular the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make a lot of kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version only associated with the petrol engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which stands between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, Sportive.
In return for this important amount, Mazda3 will give us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "first"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality incarnate by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have us more than ever glamorous, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "P", as sophisticated as it is used to, had opted for a dark lady.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to look at its e-mail, without offering the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or navigating on the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, or less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone's date subscription.
In view of its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He's just as limited as his American great-brother, but he has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those travelling with a Smartphone already know what it is like to give up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a café on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check out their mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it's been a long time since it should work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the little characters.
The European Commission's repeated calls for affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a virtually perceptible effect.
Outside its home country, we hesitate to use the data, and we're not wrong.
That a small device like FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators start thinking differently and study various proposals that allow them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, including the download of books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no galley.
This is a connected device and is paid at the time of its purchase and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: an option to purchase with access to life as Peek already proposes it in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
The yellow is probably the preferred color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to the position of Barack Obama in the United States presidency with a dress and a coat of that color, she, in fact, chose the same to accompany her in the second, no doubt the most important of her life: the surrender to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow moving towards the green with bright reflections, twice, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So for the first time, it would seem that the first lady in the United States followed the seal of the Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for the take of function, however, it would bring a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium heel green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden model, this time.
She also changed hair: the hair is now picked up while she was wearing them off the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Women's Fecundity and Professional Career in Spain" carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey, conducted out of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers had their career limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the start of life in couples and the number of children, whether or not women work and the type of employment employed.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have unstable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, repel entry into married life and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of fixed employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in a couple. This figure is 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "This data shows that women with stable employment have needed more time in their lives to obtain it, which has led them to repulse the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exerted has a strong influence on maternity, but less on the date of common start-up," says CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that widens the age gap between women's and their first child's marriage.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who did elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education get married and have their first child before finding stable employment, those who have done middle-level or higher-level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
As of next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several products of the brand, waving the universal motto "Because I value it well."
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, comes to join other celebrations inscribed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British Fashion Prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His largest representatives, creators and mannequins, of yesterday and today, met for their annual award, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed your appointment.
The former mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best mannequin of the year.
The Ace Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" by writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does so not according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summation, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither the friars nor the lighting.
Delightful, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you a few moments here.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, that which I felt without naming it: pleasure against mortal fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihillist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic mood, devoid of sense, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of the universal literature, which must be engraved by the north face, on which the best mountaineers still leave and always taken."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the cry from a bridge by this Munch character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did it in the flight of himself and invoking postterity with a violent speech to the asticotes."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneels down and prays: "Godly beloved, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave the verses of Spenser were engraved: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the life, tired the death rescued."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband normally accepted that she told her that Edouard VII was standing between the Azalades or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man as patient and in love with a nervosa whose literary talent exceeded madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it wasn't to try to conceal Joyce from Baroja?
What was Benet trying to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did This if it was not to aspire to the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?"
A lethargy assault
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a blood-mele, saved from the SPA and weighed no more than six pounds, and without a word, they took him two blows of feet that left the dog badly injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what there is to be fun at the free assault of a small defenceless animal, who was also left behind.
It should be added to this the indignation of a woman who walks quietly and who, when she insults these individuals, becomes afraid for her physical integrity, since an energetic attacker is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, finally, anyone who is weaker than him.
The episode took place about 17 hours, one Tuesday as another, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog groans all day long.
We have, of course, filed a complaint at the headquarters of the neighbourhood even if we doubt that this is very useful and to avoid touching the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Indignity has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with young people to find fun to abuse a defenceless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where the good education and respect of animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvil, sets for helmet port
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the helmet port, mainly among the younger motorcycle riders, as both structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet port, as it is the only protective element that prevents head injury, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and affirmed that it contributed to this goal by other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new two-wheel helmet-port promotion campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the widest circulation.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles progresses
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, most importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be clouded, since the reference for comparison, in November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated during the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles have been added (various from passenger cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
Although the large clouds most affected by their demand have not been so clear, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases thanks to external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of bank appropriations, other factors such as increased unemployment rates or the persistence of poor economic conditions should be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, the 2000E purchase aid was of little benefit.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of Co2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, they may also benefit, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, it was reiterated the need for administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The concessionaires' association provides for a year similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (tourist vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As has happened with the ABS braking system and as will be done with ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory component on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen pedestrian protection, even if, by its way of action, it can also help to prevent many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing pressure on the brakes in case of emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always maintain pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of these intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four of them with wounded would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to radar or camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors rejects the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Figueruelas Opel plant (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would need more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, understands that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be made in the next few days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer's nomination for Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, takes importance.
In case there would not agree with any of them, GM could sell a portion of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious gem, Porsche engineers left Boxster S and succeeded in cutting it off of nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to move, in the first place, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual roof, allowing them to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the petrol tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winnings, to mount sports basketballs, 12 kilos, and with light tyres of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six more kilograms and replacing the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK box, the test was performed on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with lead.
On the contrary: it was a long time since we had not tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees so much security in the turns, including at high speed.
It's a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles little speed for the time needed, until we ask him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
That's exactly what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Sound of motor at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option or by a system that modifies the engine rustling, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either at the stop or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The road cover we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed well the chicken nests.
The electronic assistants barely acted on the whole trip, while on some turns we found glazing in the morning and gravel later in the morning.
Finally, an ultralight car, the most entertaining to drive and that is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her face of bad girl with as much containment as her Chanel bags.
More than a Bad Girl or an It Girl is a Bag Girl.
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral obtained a triumph that exploded at 91-82 during his visit to the hard terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. He thus stands in the head of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show, which, with eight baskets at three points, was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team was aware of the major absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of engagement and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets at three points marked, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blue and red, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Victoria team had been marked from the perimeter, it was alleged that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with their hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter-time.
The second quarter-time was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's indoor game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by applause and applause back to his former house, to increase their advantage at pause (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to see himself as the best player on his team, with 13 points marked, although the "less six" of Splitter's evaluation already seemed to be not going to be the best of Brazilians this night.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and the Avala team wanted to remind Vitoria that they didn't win so easily on their ground, and thanks to "Elias' hand," they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to making yellows take advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, injured but far from being dead, needed to chain up a few skilful actions to take the air, and it was at that time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared, which, with three consecutive-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas, sent the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises were able to increase at the end of the third quarter-time (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play everything for the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not let anyone take what they deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and try to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and even though the Israelis drew close in the last minute (80-85), the part was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Wounds prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost sharply in Greece in the face of Olympiacos and gave him the head of Euroliga Group B in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion, nor by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and having a large budget.
The game of the first quarter-time, allowed the Andalusian to dream. A aggressive defense and three baskets at three consecutive points, two of Omar Cook's and one of Guillem Rubio's who set up the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the interior game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American drivers Beverley and Williams led the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team started to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the strike-out of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal mistakes were weighing Unicaja.
The interior players and the Lithuanian Allier Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, crossed the 44-32 advantage, at the nineteenth minute.
Impossible uphill
The third period was particularly offensive to Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, grew superior and even equaled the difference in the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the group's head chance.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to her organization, in Cook's three-point baskets, and to Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because Olympiacos was implacable when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to climb the score at 81-62, at thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you pay based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would earn based on their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How much should you pay?" calculates the wages of users from more than 140,000 job offers available in Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since the application has been working for a week, the search engine has generally detected that the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a communiqué Trovit product manager, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45 226 euros gross annually and a French gross 31 059, while a Spanish receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid job in Spain is that of a server, with 11 592 euros net annually, followed by a seller, with 14,725 euros, and a worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet over the last three months are drivers, middle-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The reverse president will have to abandon the diplomatic legion by 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed on TV Globo that "Mel" knows he has to leave the embassy, where he has been refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, following his term of office, he must seek another destination."
The chain also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that he intended to impose on the government de facto presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which inflation of assets has constituted the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetaryize debt through direct acquisition of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at near zero rates, in order for financial institutions to purchase assets to be mobilized.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, start to put a little sand on the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their award to one year of next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of stock exchanges and deviations from business obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is once again an envelopment towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this instability episode, but then Standard & Poor's threat of a new revision to the lower qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk defenders, who were again trying to bring about a case of conscience among the world's economic policy makers who had curbed the destructive effects of the limitation of the job destruction credit, while what should be done is a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is like a tribal struggle between the Emirs to restore its place in power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot to the roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country in the euro area to fail to meet its commitments.
On the other hand, it makes sense that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gap increases to the extent of the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If the European gaps were decreasing and ours continued to increase, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdotal. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their models of revival and to revise their forecasts upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who come back to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not give much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for now "precautionary is mother of certainty".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Members, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed these days for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the Subcommission, at eight o'clock.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million up to 2020 and EUR 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that nuclear power plants in operation today would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
However, Iberdola considers that for the next decade investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 on, the issue changes, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses both on gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, he considers that 18 000 MW are needed more, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economics Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his company claims, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate warming policies.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "timely" measures, as the President of Iberdrola has described them.
In any event, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are in the long term, should begin to be taken, because they are taking some time before they reach their maturity and a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
Swiss company Swissport, subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of a leading partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaborative protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on highways and airports.
Acionea disputes its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Aciona fights for its first concession motorway in Australia, on which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The site at stake is an estimated tunnel of $1,700 million (about €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Aciona to settle in the country as a public works undertaking and concessionaire of motorways.
The city mayor wishes to be able to dispose of this by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to $1,700 million (about €1,047 million) and in the last phase, three consortia are faced with a remarkable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish smooth company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground workers.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, the capital of which is shared between the Austrian Leighton (filial of the German manufacturer Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of CSA), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Galician company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatisations, but entering it is a major challenge, if not by the way of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an invalid stage for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has barely earned a place in this market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, Leighton's owner.
Millionaire assets
Action has focused on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the area of desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind turbine park, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and directs the assembly of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalisator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the markets for construction and infrastructure management.
The underground toll road, promoted by the City Infrastructure Office of Brisbane and Northern Link, is called to link the western highway of Toowong to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this road toll will be opened at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will bring $500 million in Australian dollars (€308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to be largely fruitful, Hochtief, who mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fibre-optic broadband network.
This intervention will enable 400,000 people to have fast Internet access and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company surrendered the project of construction of the 27-storey King George tower in Brisbane City. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is granted the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after being entrusted with the work of expanding the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the site is scheduled for early 2010 and will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore saw the promotion of Renfe
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to Mrs Rushmore, for a budget of approximately €3 million per year, the railway operator indicated.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that presented themselves to the call for tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the past three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for its anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephone by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs on the margins of regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and a state enterprise has accumulated more than EUR 450 million in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it poses to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivistic.
A app shop
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephony subsidiary followed the signs of other operators and opened a web app shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
At first, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has contributed 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The League of Champions has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth positions of the clubs that have trapped the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income of major clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated €5 362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to the information of UEFA.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to reach the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams who also earned the most money for their participation in the last League of Champions.
And that, even though they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with respect to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This paradox appears to be explained by the complex procedure for the allocation of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, Michel Platini's organization plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
From this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including the Atletic of Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who succeeded in participating received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each game in dispute.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in eighths of finals receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in quarter of finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça seized 2.5 million to win the Super Cup of Europe in August.
Moreover, there are variable payments to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive places.
The champion of the previous year carries 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid on the basis of the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group listed yesterday the details of the supply of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9 % of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which will be paid in 10 years and which will be paid at 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore evaluates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The NCMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it did, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure his leadership.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible offers of purchase and of the govs and judicials of his former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as an internal audit director.
A decision made by the first woman to occupy a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group's president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the next few months it will reveal new diversions of funds cannot be diverted.
Regarding the credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes the OPA of Paternina Exclusion by Investora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were conforming to the existing standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet submitted as a result of the changes applied on 2 December.
The NCMV stated that the offer relates to the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95 % of social capital, consisting of 6 142,786 shares admitted to negotiation on the Madrid and Bilbao scholarships.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, and that they could in no way be transmitted prior to the completion of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of the parts and the working time can be a long and complex work.
To calculate by hand the cost of a repair of between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including the parts and the working hand can take two or three hours.
However, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100 percent of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, then to process and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car gets out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is very hard work, because each of the thousand pieces of the vehicle must be catalogued and the price entered.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a tourism car is established.
If it is a model sold massively, the work can be ready within a week if the process progresses very quickly.
In the case of an unsold car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With respect to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99 %.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audadex has eight centres distributed around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each is specialized in certain brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests annually 90 million to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to provide different uses and offer various products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the countries, there are also tools for the management of the cash parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that teaches about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the light product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it is removed from the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the business sector on the Internet that allows to run on vehicles declared to be wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, to carry out geo-demographic analyses or to know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible, for example, to study how many models of a particular brand went to the garage for a failure or how many suffered severe damage for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and time.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971, as a service provider and solutions for the assessment of car accidents, tires or maintenance.

Internet auctions of damaged cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is intended exclusively for industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cassettes and professional vendors who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was set up in 1996 in Germany and runs over 650 000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500 000 are in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but some parts that are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Private garages in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a quote in only four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are needed.
Once the model has to be repaired identified thanks to its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears then the necessary piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour prices, increases or reductions, then he can print the currency to deliver it to the client.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audatex works to make these images three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the internal face.
