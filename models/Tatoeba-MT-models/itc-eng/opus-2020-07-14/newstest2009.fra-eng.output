At the end of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange in the negative
After Tuesday morning's fall, Prague's scholarship rewrites its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague stock exchange renewed with its fall from the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the fall is due to the fall of shares on Wall Street.
The market response to the result of the vote by the House of American Representatives, which refused to adopt the stabilization plan for the US financial sector, is also visible in our homes.
Action in Asia
Asian scholarships experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the indices succeeded, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong stock exchange lost four percent during the trade, but later it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decrease to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock movement of the Hong Kong stock exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually we managed to reduce losses to 4.3 percent.
According to the index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about US rescue action will affect the financial markets around the world," noted Joseph Yam, the head of the Hongkong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates have the same level as in the United States in Hong Kong.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries might be affected.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the House of American Representatives rejected the draft support for the financial system, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion of Kč).
The legislators thus withdraw the call to support President George Bush's project.
Bush said the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
American actions have experienced, Monday, a bloodbath and the main indices of action have been the biggest fall in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having suffered such a fall for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Céda Congress: the U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the US financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. legislators made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of funding of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns) granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not as sure as it is.
Before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial support plan will be reviewed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the House's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should have priority to be put to the vote in the Senate.
Economists say the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor in damaging the financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
"We made great progress.
We have resolved our divergent views on the form that the package of measures should have for market stabilization," Dr. Nancy Pelosi confides to the Bloomberg Agency.
In her view, the final vote could be taken on Sunday.
On Saturday night at Sunday, representatives of the legislators met US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
It should purchase from financial companies the invincible real estate assets that lead to considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to pursue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the declining share markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, Harry Reid did not escape, the legislators made it possible for Congress to reach a final agreement on Sunday.
They thus wish to calm investors before the start of trade on Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could influence the exchange of Monday.
However, it is now impossible to specify with certainty when the two Houses of the U.S. Congress will proceed to the vote, or whether negotiations may not be blocked, at the last moment, by such a problem or by such a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, there will be still many changes in the law.
The total amount intended for use of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if Congress has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the possibility to block the remaining amount, following two steps: first 100 billion extra dollars, then, to finish, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may put his veto on this decision, the Congress has the opportunity to place him as a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining finance for the purchase of bad real estate, of which the value falls, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to hold the vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chair of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, protection of taxpayers from losses, the relief agreement, the development of the time axis plan.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of these golden parachutes for directors of the companies participating in the program and for the establishment of a committee, which will ensure the monitoring of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new accounts in the case of mortgages it will purchase, while reducing the monthly accounts of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
According to the economist leader of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we are unaware of the mechanism and the price of the purchase of the assets to problems.
This will be crucial to deal with the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," says Marek this week at the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is to be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, as important as that.
"It is much more important that congressmen agree, as of this week, to support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological meaning of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, matters the most at the moment," stressed Marek.
A struggle pushed at the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
You will be advised, how to choose
While virtually every mobile can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent sufficient reasons for obtaining an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not go on vinyl discs, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there's in your shelves of loaded vinyl discs, with rock art, jazz or blues, you're probably dreaming at least of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, namely compressed music, to be described in a simplified way - of music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time supporting listeners bought for twenty crowns in the market.
These are two extremes, among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music readers are capable of much more than simply reading music, but these are unknown functions, of course, most of the furniture.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, phone calls and SMS sending, it is able to read music and movies, record them, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, serve as a navigational device.
And if you take into account smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are almost witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without inconvenience.
The larger the number of functions you use, the more the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And music reading is one of the most important energy goinfles.
Mobiles that are able to read music for ten to twelve hours are rare, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you can call from time to time, look up, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this being valid even for cheaper devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are capable, as a result of a reload, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing ones.
Another problem arises when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially not all of them can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Of course, you can record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know to take it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in the mobiles.
With regard to readers, you do not need, except for (iPod), any software.
Just fill the music device from the computer through the USB connector.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or then the judgment of the user.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, in the way of Windows Exploration, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a specific device, be especially interested in the lifespan of the accumulator, in the capacity of memory, in the quality and type of output of sound and, of course, in the ease of order.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just have any mobile reading MP3.
Practically all the furniture is now capable of it.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
All come to read the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will just have this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also read WMA-format music.
The AAC (format used by the Apple firm and its iPods), as far as it is concerned, is less common.
High-end furniture also enables, for example, the purchase of online music.
Simply visit the operator's web pages (or other supplier's) from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason to obtain a musical mobile.
The operator's offer is unfortunately miserable and, in most cases, it is limited to radio tubes quickly made.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (either via GSM, the Internet, or even the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their mobiles on their own.
Whenever you wanted to listen to something, you just got to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have listeners or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in enclosures, which have almost all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The least expensive normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand crowns, you can already have a very suitable walkman.
In most cases, however, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also with an entry for ordinary listeners, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
On the other hand, readers have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really no one comes to order the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the appearance of the order with that of a cassette position, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission invoice.
Which apparatus to choose
Even the cheapest devices (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have an exchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Base models support in principle only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones leave even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized Walkman Mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and so the ease of the command is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman-series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the farthest way in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win Chechnya this same year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czechia is relatively advanced, our operators offering almost the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
Maybe he won't be missing for long.
We have mentioned, on many occasions, on Mobil.cz, the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTú (The Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
This is how, following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming fee regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How is it possible for Czech prices to remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that goes far beyond 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú), who stated several times that there was no place in Czechia for another operator, is chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network seems to have no more chances (in fact, now, he would find only difficult frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that resulted in a considerable drop in prices, which would then also have to react to conventional operators.
However, even before the entry of the fiestas such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to what we hear today at home were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, the operator managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let's add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta Financial Group, which has among other things the U:fon in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual operators being the possibility to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need much less customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high construction, operation and maintenance costs of the mobile network.
This is how virtual operators in the world look like low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers, in Britain, text messages at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, placing on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator that pleases them and they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work with us as well.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone spokesperson, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
The greater the fact that he is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In Czechia, no chance, tell mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in Czechia, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in Czechia negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," said in a telephone entertainment for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It therefore indirectly confirmed that the operators in Czechia were not, in any case, in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the business customer field, has not, for quite a long time, been hiding its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We tend to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner it's gonna be the better.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have succeeded in moving forward in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl's spokesman.
The future is therefore perhaps promising.
According to informal information, it seems that we could perhaps host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by a total silence.
"At the moment, we do not think that there is any place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared with other very specific ones.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vladimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
The spokesperson for T-Mobilea Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not registered for the moment a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time period, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs its attention to the fulfilment of requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means most customer input.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities: in phase with the operators
The mobile operators' approach is easily understandable, another operator's entry would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profit.
What, then, is it good to facilitate the arrival of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to hear themselves as a slot thief. Chicane accompanies the creation of the U:phone also testifies to it.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, when creating the U:fon, was the one exercised by the T-Mobile company.
This shows information available to the public from the ČTÚ web pages.
But today, the U:fon is willing to serve as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this connection: "Competition on the mobile market has also recently been enhanced by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and above all its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of mobile operators here, the indifference of Czech regulators seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of the ČTú, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in the economic competition in Czechia.
The latter belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopts, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the relevant virtual operator regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached for the time being, since the offer of potential stakeholders has not previously presented sufficient interest to conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa in response to our question from the UOHS Department of External Relations.
A statement thus made would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and on the other hand, so that no one takes advantage of his position on the market, such a statement is more than misleading.
Even more than Kristián Chalupa adds: "Out abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the sense of a fair functioning of the market and a lower price does not appear to be part of the UOHS interests.
What is really shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the chance and the hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not noted, in this regard, signs of anticompetitive behaviour, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position, so none of them has an increased responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the telecom regulator," he stated in his statement Chaloupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTú that telecommunications is, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts propose another view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at each time.
And the mobile operator logically has the monopoly on his network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the UOHS that three mobile operators proceed in a similar manner.
However, complaints from many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Taking responsibility for the ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, by which the UOHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to introduce the recently adopted Telecommunication Act to extend ČTú's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
This requires the UOHS representatives to know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
However, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudooperators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unclear.
They are companies publishing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but they are only public in part.
In most cases, it is a matter of firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
For example, specific mobile telephone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms generally come only to the electorate.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company in front of the operator is a classic business client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important client, she gets special price offers (and others).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If there were to happen what you are referring to, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions that we would consider and which could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the company in question," answered our question regarding this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has not been reached to those responsible for mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, this may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator takes a decision against such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these firms bring them unfavourable benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are obliged to admit that the SIM card on their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the way ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that is exactly what should seem strange to ČTú.
In addition, another question is raised in the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to reveal such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim that they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions would prohibit it.
When we will no longer be the most expensive country
As we have mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has resulted in a considerable decrease in service prices.
However, virtually in all the countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators were trying, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in the developed countries intervened, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators, but that of their customers.
Both through formal measures and through informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are dealing with this issue in the way a hot potato is being disposed of by transmitting it to a near target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than beneficial to them.
But don't throw your sleeve after the cognate.
If the information on the flow is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our home, the Czech mobile market may be moving.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will not be able to remain impermissible in the face of the rejection (to discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the day of Czech nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde kastav m.j (Where is my homeland?).
The hymn was once again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with heart and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the hymn arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek sees the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted Český rozhlas (Czech Public Radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care of what the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good dictionary, so that one could understand the words, which they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate, next year, its 175th anniversary.
Kde's song was first resounding in 1834 on the stavovské divadlo boards (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des sapvetiers), a Czech piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It will remain one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymne sounds
Freight transport (MHD) will introduce, on Wednesday, the chip into their ticketing system
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragois Transportation Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will be placed in the subway, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible for about a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (the coupon will be valid as from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it recorded on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transportation Agency), located at the metro stations Muzeum, Městek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday on, there is also the possibility to purchase coupons via the Internet on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can permanently forget the windows in the metro stations, where they so far had to tread impatience in long queues in order to obtain paper tickets.
In fact, they will purchase their coupon online and will be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points of contact, there is a window at the disposal of passengers with trained staff, which will help those interested with the internet purchase and will also record the coupon they purchased on their card," said the spokesman for the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind the machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be ninety," Opatrný added.
An automatic will control the coupon instead of the driver
Autos that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city.
In peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the communes of the Central Bohème to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transports of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of Filip Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which conceives the schedules of the transport in common pragois.
Periurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's box.
When embarking, it is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the smart card, but also to place the opencard at the location indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered coupons.
"If the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal adds.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and do not remember the date on which their coupon expires, can reconnect automatic distributors, initially used to record coupons on the card.
This is where the information about the validity of their document will be displayed on the device screen.
The Southeasts called for a referendum in the USA
In 1945 the Germans of the South asked that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This is the result of a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the South Bohemian Republic).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of South Germans allegedly addressed the President of the USA with such a desire.
This derives from, among other things, a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans of Český Krumlov in the letter urge the US President not to allow "šumavská župa" (region of forests south of Bohemian) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have fully understood the situation and we want to be absolutely sure that the words proclaim that the American troops come into the German territory not in bullies and enemies, but in liberators," is written in the letter, "People, to whom the fate of Šumava holds hearts."
Given that the rallying in Czechoslovakia is not so promising - by knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, senseless attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take into his hands the protection of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe, that you would grant this territory to a foreign State to us, that oppresses and destroys minorities and that has contributed nothing to the Allies' victory without taking into account the opinion of the 4 million inhabitants," is the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech Oppressors".
If the President of the USA questioned the Germans' opinion of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudetes of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least find out that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them had such an opportunity.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to get a certain kind of autonomy for the Southeast.
Others thought they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born at České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as German of České Budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the catch camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to teach them the Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," Chalupa said.
None of the Germans captured in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Beneš decrees, he would be expelled from the Republic.
Do not think — you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way of characterizing the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš .ebíček's office believes that it will discourage drivers from acting dangerously in the wheel.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving quickly and from driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, she wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also shows the slogan "singling" throughout the campaign:
Do not think — you pay!
The phrase "You do not think" is inscribed in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood stream, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
What must symbolize that we can pay for a moment of carelessness from life.
The spots will "hanther" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has inspired similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
It believes that this will result in a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and driver whipping strategy
"What works with drivers is the sugar system and whip.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by the saving of time, when they grill a red fire.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of the drivers," said Martin Kořán, the transportation psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
Panels reporting the danger to drivers are, in his view, already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," said Kořán.
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli provisional Government, spoke out in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the heights of the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), or even all of them," Olmert said on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give Palestinians a similar percentage (from Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be done," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as it has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," noted Olmert, alluding to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the holy and historic sites" located within the Old Town.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work," he stressed later.
Retreat of the Golan heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's retirement from the Golan's heights, which he believed was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts from Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retirement from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the Hezbollah (quiitiously Shiite); they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (the Shiite Movement), Al-Kaïda (the terrorist network), as well as that of the Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are Stewards in because they are illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the Student Agency company near Padua in Italy, the question arises whether the stewards and passengers can travel within the bus.
"If one wishes to respect the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the bus.
The girl was at that moment unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident, or even brake abruptly, also at the time the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical sheet equipped with standing or not spaces.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Long-distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aksuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue that we dealt with with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the standing role - there is no legal requirement to do so.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of a vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds the Hanzelka spokesperson with greater ambiguity.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, the Director of the Road Traffic Department, believes that the law is sufficiently sensitive to the problem.
"Everything depends on the fact that the bus in its approval has the permission to offer standing seats.
Everything lies in there," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing spaces and a limited maximum speed, interurban with standing spaces and a higher permitted speed and in long distance buses without standing at the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, expert at BESIP (Road Traffic Safety) in Transport, does not see the displacement of the steering stations on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger; the situation can be compared to that of the service on planes.
Also, it's not safe when there's a turbulence, and the air hostess can form its head."
"Or, in the event that the bus would have stopped in a sudden manner, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the booths with internal requirements," he says, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer Stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession a risky profession.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I have the impression that it is a job at risk, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
This would also reduce the costs," he said.
Security concerns are the reason why the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines in his vehicles, is unable to deliver.
"We have no hostess. We have opposed it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," he said a year ago at Týden.cz.
A great tragedy has arrived
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the line of Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stopband without using a flasher and blocked the road by the bus.
The driver tried to avoid it by means of a sudden manoeuvre, but he frowned on it on his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two booths' seats have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but for financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
No in view
An amendment to the Act, which has been being developed for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the movement of the highways on board the bus.
"Now, it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it does not care too much about buses, but rather about the point system, at the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile on the wheel," said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider steering activities as a fundamental threat to passenger safety," concludes spokesman Hanzelka, stating that the control of bus safety is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are based on Frankfurt.
The main words were not missing in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the household employees.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Deka Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the Sparkasse financial group" could be constituted, according to the public e-mail Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "bench of competence" doubled by sustainable productivity in such a case.
In addition, such a relationship could be the decisive move towards other mergers in the Länder banking sector.
This is what this is like when a steering committee tends to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the wounded WestLB still has a strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Authority, which has, only recently, made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, it has been a question for some time already - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between the bank Deka, who knew the customers of Sparkasse from their investment funds, and WestLB.
Indeed, the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas announced at the end of August that he did not see any sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported and by the banks of the Länder and by the groups of savings banks, commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct discussions with WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts thereof.
Talks, however, have just begun, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, has one of the most important employers on the financial place in Frankfurt, is involved in the consolidation of the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a time that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Land of Palatinat and the Halbab.
But nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had hardly been made public that the Government of the Land of Hesse was speaking against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Afterwards, neither the other two houses joined in.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinat was linked to the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there has always been new negotiations on the consolidation of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had, however, come up against any trade strategy to merge with his bank.
In spite of this, the feeling seems to be that the grouping of different institutions in the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could be realized at first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If pressure from new mergers was to increase, potential partners would soon escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The group of Hesse-Thuringe savings and transfers, which owns 85 per cent of the capital of Helaba, instead drew a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
He'd stick to the NordLB rigour.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another facet raises the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can come together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, by which business model the future capacity of Länder banks should be secured, had not been resolved by the German stock exchange group of savings and transfers.
In the end, a division of the WestLb could take place, a piece which is obviously not desired here.
This is also discussed in the letter of the existing Steering Committee: in any event, a 'global solution' would be addressed to the establishment.
How will all of this be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank still to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer party is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a little friend, and so nothing is like that, he says.
Behind them, close to a ton of five liters of beer from the Kaiser brand, is a well built barbu that shows about 200 visitors of the beer festival which deep sounds his housewife can produce.
Elena hits Luca first, then hugs him.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the new Puorta station, four buses start tonight at 2345, `destination Monaco, party of beer', expected at 630.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, on one of the buses travelling exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they've already feasted last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which wears a long coat double of false fur and glasses with large silver frames.
For the past five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three people have been fired for nothing but this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 8:30.
It would take unnecessary expenses to spend the night there, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a person in charge of the German speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive in the night on the highway `Brenner' direction.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets calm in the bus, the travelers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with plates of Italian registrations again take a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When early in the morning, the Marco group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking lot near the Place Thérèse, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering together, Marco has one last speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, it cooks from the little yellow cap.
On the left is written 'Beer Party', in gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `knowing-how.it'.
Second: `When the doors of the chapel of the beer open, we cut,' cried Mark in the morning.
`Courir!' Run and reserve places at the bottom of the tent.
`Not in front, but in the room, and not all the yellow caskets on the same benches, they must be distributed in the room!'
The chop, raising Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the advice!
`Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `This evening, come back here at ten and a half hours!'
And there it is, it's going to the beer party.
On the road, someone new from the yellow helmets to the trees to find the way, the signs and even an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We're trying to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer party, known as the `week-end of the Italians'.
There are no specific figures; we speak of 50,000 who are on their way through the Alps and collapse into the beer booth, 10 percent of the visitors would come from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police are reinforced by seven Southern Tyrolan police officers, by Italian voluntary rescuers who support the Bavarian red cross who carry out statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia nights for the shareholders of Hippo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word `relatively' and he thought that the German banking sector would not be spared by crisis movements.
This has actually happened this weekend.
The finance of the Bavarian property Hypo Real Estate (HRE), alongside the DAX, receives a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect itself from turbulence in the markets.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid appropriations were issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Royal Estate Hippo should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would have been entitled.
Money comes from private banks as well as public-law banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughter company supports losses.
The state finance, according to a newspaper article, had been refinanced in the short term for long-term projects for which it borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to €2.37 million, the own capital rate had also slightly weakened from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period the previous year, fell to zero, the profits from the allocation of fixed securities and securities and the termination of provisions in credit operations had dropped from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the significant benefits of the reimbursement of downturn accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for companies in Konzern that the deficit in gains of about 16 percent has been moderated.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state finance had firstly poorly speculated on real estate industrial credits, which had then been affiliated with the Aareal bank.
Because classical funding was not profitable enough, Depfa had then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and State investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the child-society, the Hippo Real Estate must carry out amortization that should have on the calculation of the group's gains and losses an essential material effect that remains still quite vague.
The fact is the dividends have been amputated.
Already in 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a very important state investor and infrastructure since Depfa was bought.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on interbank market refinancing, since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks has again been considerable, the banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual part - about 50 billion euros - of all Depfa credits of a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a communiqué from the Royal Estate, the group's need for funding is covered with the medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of the financial international markets largely out of date.
Other sources say that refinancing will be provided through funds up to the end of 2009.
The Chair of HRE Georg Funk's Steering Committee, on the other hand, explained that the Hippo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for Financial Services Surveillance (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Royal Hippo Group in the market is now assured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank are only hoping for it.
However, in the light of the dynamics and taxation of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Furthermore, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in all its scope.
But neither can it be removed.
Following the fact that the bank is, according to the latest releases, still at the gates of insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least interim will not succeed in reassuring the spirits either.
The course of action fell from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The course of the obligations, on the other hand, is particularly good.
While first-in-chief debt has barely moved, second-plan loans have declined.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hippo, and of course those that have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The liabilities of the Hippo Real Estate bank previously appeared to be an alternative speculation investment, and their value must now be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself that brought the crisis into the establishment by the purchase of the Depfa bank.
As long as the emission institutes, governments and the less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that there will be a resurgence of the arrears over time.
Or what no one will hope for at this time will happen - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability approaching certainty has now become a simple based hope.
This should first of all reserve nights of insomnia for long-term creditors on the decision to determine whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they've drawn on to be a deferral of the losses for the next years on the next income tax of automatically taken stock-making gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is to appear for the first day at the High School in Tajikistan, girls start to laugh: the German is so "Kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word through the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of course in Japan.
What I was excited about.
Already on the way to school, I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
I have to find the way alone, I'm glad I didn't miss it.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be set as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students appear after each other from eight hours, until nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not much of a fan of talking to people, especially to a class of 40 students.
As I had not yet had the uniform of the school, I put on an old coat of my mother's welcome, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, therefore, I stood before the desk, and tried to pronounce it correctly: 'Sayona Wo She Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have all made low masses, dusted with laughter and signs, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him through my sleeves.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese ados and means "mignon, chou".
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor the girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong resounded, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone spoke to those who were better, would laugh and ask me a lot of questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My foster mother also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German case.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, concave salad and algae, fruits and some sort of meat around Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salted plums confessed, brrrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to make a little better the boy's knowledge during the break.
I read that in my sleeves.
I'm curious if I can see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always said:
'Cause it makes me what?
At the end of the day, reading sleeves is what I've been preferring for years.
And in order to better understand the mangoes and the culture that lies there, at one time, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there someday.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, us and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cockroach in the face of danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else so far could prove it just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, at least one can hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or in general consciousness, we enter difficult terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he does death, escape or attack.
Human beings behave in the same way, that is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of the animals difficult.
One aspect is that circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and management and enforcement functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
So at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from the other primates.
Another significant characteristic could reside in the linguistic nature of Man: a large part of his existence is related to language, which often means that his conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if the conscience was not to depend on the language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, regardless of the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of conscience.
That is why it is also difficult to determine what the conscience can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses major problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of the consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened in the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of the visualization.
But what happens then to emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we describe as "serious" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its follow-up, such as the reactions of the body) takes hold of living memory.
As observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially the Man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impose them on others than on ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities are born in the cortex and brain trunk regions, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which however focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in cross-sectional sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can't contradict it, but I think it's indisputable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in men and rats is likely to be as felt in both cases: how can we check if rats and men feel the same when they behave similarly?
A safe escape from danger, but if they feel fear?
In my view, similar behaviours are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the other hand do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the origin of sensations?
And even if we could prove this for Man: how could we show it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (you know?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely to differ completely from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is being made on the nervous level as the same is being seen in rats and humans.
As I don't explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I don't know if they exist.
This could be seen as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly slamming against a wall.
I am a pragmatic emotional person.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik told.
"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work just started, and there's still a lot to do in both countries."
In the calendar of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA always has our eyes on us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN is not able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP press agency.
"We assured the President of UEFA in a mail that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division league were already sentenced to compulsory relegation manipulation in the previous season; in the end, the beginning of the League has even to be delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Indicated counter-attack Quaid
She wanted to do promotion for a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her former adulterine Dennis Quaid.
It ecumenically - and counterattack.
A late Rose war for the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a gruesome battle - in the sight and the knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan had expressed himself in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the failure of marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have known about the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it is told the story of an adulteress.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his reputation as an unfaithful husband clearly fell down: it would be "Monstrous," he said to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg restores again the history of our relationship and manipulates it".
It would be more "resolved", that "the pain and upheavals that involve a divorce for every child are re-enlived in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
Thus was his reply to the crack: "In any case, my life continues.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's going best."
Prices for plane tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 percent.
Cheap flights and hotel nights would be re-gained - this is the result of a study by the financial service provider and travel American Express.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and established, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, a significant decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by 6.9 percent on average compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was marked mainly in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this were for American Express in the low dollar course that led to a "destination of travels in decline of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are held with an increase of 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in the economic class paid on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-distance flights, which are very fuel consumers, have even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices in the economic class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in the business class and in the first class, however, the price changes were significantly less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they dropped by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this drop in prices would be, on the one hand, diminishing economic growth, explains the firm.
The demand would go beyond the ground in many parts of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the Open Sky Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of non-rentable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have deposited the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the top of the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find a functional eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will only be late in the game and his up shot failed against the frame of the goal.
His message was formulated precisely, he had come out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," siffla Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the halls of Hamburg.
There was not much going on in the locker rooms, and the middle of the day was over, and most of them were taking their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades, he has a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received in strategic locations.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquired and raised the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the Chief Coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
The orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The practice failed.
"Everything wasn't very beautiful to see today," confessed Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "sweetness also be more relaxed."
This 1:0 (1:0 in the half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a head hit by Mladen Petri (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the low players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Marin Jol.
The SV in Hamburg will celebrate on Monday its 121 years.
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional classification tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take back," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper, as well as Jansen debauched from the CF Bayern - is certainly slowly formed, but it still does not shine.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the vote has been failed
At Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan has dropped the Dow Jones temporarily of 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little caught up.

Bank Goldman Sachs' shares accused a decrease of almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, great investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called damaged mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid once, but progressively.
In exchange, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial corporation that may be exchanged in conjunction with the evolution of the course in order to reduce the burden for the Public Treasury.

The dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes as they call gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts are concerned that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Because of early frozen fuel pipelines, cryogenic death threatens her.
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvring of space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, just like the Ulysses solar probe.
This is surprising to researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave to 100 percent of the way it is expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Much more, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of Albert Einstein's general relativity, which describes the force of attraction to matter because of the curve of space, might not be entirely correct.
U.S. physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always believes that Einstein is not wrong and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter for only about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists taken from Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their fans, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released as well as the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed it.
The Sudanese raiders had demanded a multi-million euro ransom.
During the shooting before the release, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be under way.
The Germans are constantly in the back of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what has been communicated in concert with Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their state of health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians and their eight Egyptian companions are well and safe, announcing Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the tour in the desert should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a shooting before the hostages were released are still vague: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the unhindered kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the officer.
There was nothing left but to collect hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had killed six of the raiders in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt this Sunday, and two of them had been arrested.
The hostage takers had demanded a ransom of €6 million from Germany; the money had to be handed over by the German woman from one hostage.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the pests wanted to free women hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men had to be taken until the raiders found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law that leads to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse by his father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stithians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after having admitted eight charges for undue crime.
The High Court of Truro referred to the regular connection between his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child living in Coventry, Trerise had attached her and banded her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwalls.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer of National Trust, was haunted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had reported that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had looked "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the beautiful father of his daughter who had also written a letter of confession, which concluded: "I regularly attacked her and bandage her".
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Justice Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetish, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn't done this, her story would certainly never end in court."
He added: "I particularly stress, as his father and mother describe him, the effects of your crime commit for years on Stéphanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Departmental Officer who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train will be sentenced by the Office Secrets Act to BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train heading to Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of people in Whitehall.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguard of information.
.The Crown prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Secret Services Committee
His missing documents contained reviews of Al-Qaeda as well as of the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and then moved from home to a secret place.
Building companies face the B&B bill.
British building companies could have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 buildings.
Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it's "irritant" to know that companies and their members will have to pay broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be refunded when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages will be released.
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time, will be debited every year to the 700 financial companies that collect deposits .
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed at the BBC that the 59 buildings companies are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that the institutions that had a cautious behaviour... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is claimed that each corporation must pay a proportional amount to the deposits it owns, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest of the loan will be raised in 2009 to £450million.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Company Trade Committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that the institutions who had a prudent behaviour during the resumption of the real estate market now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"we need to examine all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be taken to prevent the construction companies and their members from paying this bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year will have to be paid, which could double.
Since the buildings are non-shared organizations, their members end up paying the invoice either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five penny per litre
Jersey people need to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to raise the wholesale price of her milk, five penny per litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price resulting from a two-penny increase in February, and comes as a result of a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide whether they will go in their turn, increase the price to consumers.
. Before the February increase, the bulk price of Jersey's milk had been changed for the last time, in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail application from former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could be arrested on his return to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to provide her with bail because of her examination for having extorted a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of many accusations against him.
Khaleda Zia, the permanent rival of Sheikh Hasina, was relaxed on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks' time, but her party, the Awani League, demanded that the provisional military government of the country give her full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free when she returned to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail as she was authorized to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former leader of the Awami Party said.
She was detained last year after the acting military government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina like Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges they are subjected to.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-police campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign because of the Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination campaign last week in the six provinces.
However, it states that it is not successful in contacting children in the hazardous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesman stated that this happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the judicial battle of ITV
BSkyB has lost his trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would require him to reduce his participation in his rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and had allowed it to unduly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement actually to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of shares of VTI has been suspicious of ITV's effective independence, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing her to reduce her share of VTI would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB had just renounced her voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutors' case.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special accuser to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born of the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White House, the legislators and the former Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who claim that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
"Friendly criminally unfounded serious charges of conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his biggest recommendations.
The dispute began with the release in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But it would then emerge that the dismissed prosecutors were no longer critical than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to assign these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others would have refused to investigate the allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and pursuing court proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they may be fired at any time, but may not be for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ends up being accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, stating that he considered it to be the "first responsible" of these dismissals, and ends up "abdication" his role as leader," remarkably succeeding in not involving him in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including the former collaborator of Bush, Karl Rove, were critical of having failed to cooperate during the investigation.
The sword of Meat Loaf will have to be honored.
The Rock Star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the hit of the 1977 Meat Load album.
The award evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly gone.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, demanded a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was traded in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, to the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name, has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to heal his heartbeat became irregular, after he collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then we found him a cyst in the vocal cords.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be on sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous ones, others only functional.
And even some Veteran Taxis as well as long-standing local residents are unable to give directions to go to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to confuse with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to reopen Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbours, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the pastry of houses.
But the Department of Preservation and Development of the City's Real Estate that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighbourhood owners' committees, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay drew up a proposal allowing the real estate builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee #3.
"There is only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to preserve Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to reopen the small street and install seats there, some would actually be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, it doesn't necessarily mean that she wants to be the owner of it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relocate this abandoned drive, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Immobilier's Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, also stressing that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to his most colorful neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been bearing this name since 1802, when the legacy of the great farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving behind this small piece of land, which has been abandoned since.
The back entrance of CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened to Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of Ramones' album " Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, fins, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution to the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity - a virtual fragment identical to the city that should be taken in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Challenges: A Regard of Nostalgic Love on One City in the Extinction Process), reports the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow little ass, dark day as night, and delimited by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and Persians, full of newspapers last week that fly along the droplets."
A few exceptions near, the street always has the same look.
A rat sprawling at the bottom of the alley, near a door leading back to CBGB, and who has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of empty ounces of beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown out.
Some passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have flown into dark, wet and disgusting places."
Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates regarding bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former student in California, and a former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you don't think about it. Why middle classes must be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign points out that "Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." It's a true fact.
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program supports in particular among so many other subjects, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends instruction in language classes other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Students in this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than one third of students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Of the CM1, 100% students passed the 2008 math state exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the examination of English-language arts
This incredible success was achieved by another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street focused on analysis, practice, continuous capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the English language education "full immersion".
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in education.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, said to me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you wouldn't have had a chance to identify him."
"It works, she observes, "that worked for us"
Mr. Obama should not take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in the other schools made up of most Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results of this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
While it is in favour of the fact that immigrants are learning English, Obama has recently considered this issue as insignificant, when he proclaims that we must all stop arguing about the language of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider the models of education that work, rather than dedating them or viewing them as insignificant.
Net Oil Falls as a result of the New World Economic Concerns
Oil prices have dropped significantly on Monday, as people are afraid that the rescue plan for financial marches will not be able to bring the economy back to life.
The crude oil operations fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. New York's Mercantile Stock Exchange, this morning's sales.
Prices have dropped more than $20 in the barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having known in July, an increase of $145.29 in the barrel, prices dropped to almost $90 in the barrel this month, before rebounding to the profound uncertainties of the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again concerned despite the survival agreement, the greatest of history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, said the government this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments in part nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenetic negotiations of this week end, concluded with the rescue agreement", appear to have failed to bring the market to life."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the prospective of global equity, interest rate and market exchange has become uncertain" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a letter to their investors.
"we believe that the raw materials will not escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular, in China."
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the drop in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, so they were forced to decrease by 20 percent, the forecast for oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Day of the Second Time Determining for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After having spent the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform from the Shaun Ellis Jets, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had salted under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass in Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first one when a corner back fell and the second one, 10 seconds from the middle.
"I didn't come out of my area" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing in the catch, the defense beat the Cardinals' back quarter, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards down to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens lets the ball escape because of Warner.
The last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 yards taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best Jets could have scored in a while.
"The Jet Coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "second or third time?"
When both of the Jets were told to let go of 21 undisputable points in the third time, Mangini said, "I can tell you that I appreciate the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, exceeded his world record.
Haile Gebselassie, Ethiopian, has again proved worthy of his title as the best runner of the century, after having beaten his own record of the world to the Berlin marathon Sunday, thus becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03 :59 of an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, argued last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his great career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, of the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - it can be exaggerated in today's eyes, - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at departure, 55 at arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, contributed to the decline of marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After the Sunday victory, Gebselassie told reporters, had suffered cramps at the mill two weeks before, and had missed the training for a week.
Clearly, the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I gave myself up last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
Especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia to have too much orchestrate his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the meaning of the competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebselassia's capabilities as a background runner.
On Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. to my way.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselasia after the file heads disappeared.
A little over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made her final climb to take off Kwambai, which ends second in 2:05:36, improving her best five-minute personal record.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She was not able to participate in the games in Beijing because of a bad-backed hypothetical, but she promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
It is running through a skilled strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders to take a great advantage, then exceeding about 18 thousand 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrives second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, ends third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Orgueil and the trials of the Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, there is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the Afro-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black town to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make of today."The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison".
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival that is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city that it describes has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression- Era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston reported that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he's missing".
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the foreign gaze.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, a long-standing resident and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It must be in conformity with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and combat.
It represents both a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point but also an example of a Southist rural culture - a few times dedated, other times acclaimed - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the center of Florida, often forgotten, which leads to the chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious such a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"passed the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and these well-preserved gaming areas whose Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he hardly knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as everything that can serve people to pass.
So, just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, fucker wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality "declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's daughters who had immortalized, citing the colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added, "Some people didn't appreciate it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who came back frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston used to arrive in town without warning, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many were mocking her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he added, swinging in his chair of the backyard that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "it never remained too long."
At the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College of the 1920s, she was buried in a tomb, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world "declared Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted a five-way highway in town to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, the main street in the community.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was relegating to a difficult period in his history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mixture of races led to hatred at the doors of the community.
"at that time, a band of white youth came to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady has even died."
They launched a pastry from their car."
In a letter from 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorious of my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakened the trust of young people.
"The black children used to be kissed," I recall, "we embraced our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as head director of the Ecotonville Community Safeguard, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white," I mean, there's a cultural demarcation line here," said Melle Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have allowed the creation of space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as her, armed with a joyful trust and lines of conduct such as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began to fight to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography named after Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to American cannons.
The motorway project arrived just when the most famous girl in Eatonville had found its appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors regard her as a savior.
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that this highway would generate.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many come back in January, to commemorate it.
After many years, the container rejected the motorway's proposal.
"The five-way highway fiasco, extremely fast, is a real civic pride," Melle Nathiri said.
Melle Boyd summed up the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the motorway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A mono-themed library (named of course Hurston) opened in 2006 on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, revered.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be regarded as a rear street after the summer rain day, as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
( There are now 90 percent black)
Foreigners who have come to discover the history of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with caution.
We need to ask permission for most interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weak for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will not be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston's entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is well known in the voice of the nephew of Mr. Franklin, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional strength.
And even for the youngest, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, Winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people, passing through this area, will think: "Oh, this town has nothing compared to others," said Alondra Kenon after last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, they all talk about finance.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newsstand and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think only in the glass and bee nest offices above their heads, bankers and fund managers who monopolize New York, have spent the worst "workday at the office" since the 1929 crack.
The deliverers continue to flutter on the sidewalks, with their trolleys and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The Latino always drags between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke placed on its shoulders.
Office employees continue to tail to buy their morning sandwich to street merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 19h per week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the totally pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I was planning to work at the end of the afternoon, as I discovered at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people tailing.
Not in front of the caisseurs' windows, not to remove the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service window, where the usual customers ordered their buyers, the tourists asked for management for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I'd learn later from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," were all tailing for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from the savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only work in a state, which say treat customers like their families.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327, made use of the bankruptcy union, and while the New Yorkers would return home for the weekend and Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, on account of a value of $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that makes the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the financial world in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that failed, and her lean CEO Dick Full, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, my building's uniform concierge, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetables merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take a chance."
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Philip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vladimirs Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the "city against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting red-drawn mosques.
The Police accuses extreme right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of the political parties of extreme Right to the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; it was police, organized action.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; however, detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the extremists' hatred toward Muslim immigrants.
This accident could somehow be linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the Islamic Local Community said that it was "deeply shocked" in the announcement of this desecration, which only occurred during the religious month of Ramadan that affected its end.
Austria is serious about regaining its courage, as a result of its oscillation to the right during the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme right-wing parties that have increased almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have carried out an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of the scarf and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to the alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter forbids travel abroad.
The courts prohibited the rock star glamorous, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of children, of expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after expressing their intention to travel to Spain through France to the control authorities.
The police in Kent had given this prohibition to travel last Thursday after having proved to the magistrates that Glitter was guilty of sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in the limited court of courts of Ashford, but was also represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesperson from the court said "on Thursday, 25 September, in the Ashford court, Kent's police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present then."
Glitter, 64 years old, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leave to be registered in the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent's police stated that they would not discuss specific cases or potential Glitter's displacements in the contents.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "Kent's police will do everything they need to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"It is easier for us to monitor someone who lives in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, 10 and 11 years, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him in passport control, and at the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities denied him entry to their territory, so he was forced to leave in Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers urged him to return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of the Heathrow Airport on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the restricted court of Uxbridge, West London, for registered on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom, for the detention of images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqueui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travel to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no woolen clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, released from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On one side, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers intimate gestures and stolen views of artists who do not care to ride on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatre of some performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer resumes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These photographed people "on the street" are artists able to transmit on stage passion, sadness, joy... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality from these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a clean personality and character.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of the flamenco stars."
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a photo plated camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the material, re-commend the classic photography.
The implementation of various stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captured the audience with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about sixty-ten artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits presented at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sports" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing people's portrait, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a longer or longer time.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you don't know or that leave you just a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco called "Flamenco - people" is presented at the El Fotómata Gallery, located on the 20th Street of the Mata (the road parallel to the People's of Hercules) which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "real daring"
The novel takes place in places where no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has as principal character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who went through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner of Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real daring" and that "everybody demonstrates that he should not write it."
"If I were reasonable, I would not, but I would do it and hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the four-day exchange of ideas and thoughts that he saw parade in the city of the aqueduct about a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most expected character in the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize at the majority of the participants' voices, made a hall at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, faced a fascinate audience who had not seen the past hour during which Peru, with a wonderful memory and a great dose of humor, drew back the birth of his literary vocation, which was due to "his thirst to read" and "live new experiences"; how he wrote of a "very methodological way" through intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "inspiration gap"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less similar", because the writers were asked to "do not let themselves go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils Pozoblanco's fair
The party of the flags that concluded the bulls races of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse-toasters had verified that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organizational committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather hit this fair, since finally two out of three parties couldn't take place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
On the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have faced in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday party took place
Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after making movements of arms in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The afternoon even Alejandro Talavante concluded on two flags planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the steps discovered applauded more than his fight in himself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was suffocated by the majority of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Arava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi Police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armión (Alava).
Police officers stop two occupants of a van and the latter two take the flight.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashisch, what to stop them from.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A. J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was accused of drug trafficking and of falsifying documents.
The incident took place when various officials from the Arava Traffic Unit carried out vehicle control on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the control started.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the coast, where the two occupants fled to a forested area.
Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch balloons and then transferred to a police station for comprehensive inspection and drug weighing.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "false" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey map of the van, which is also why they charged the prisoner with a crime of falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who has managed to flee and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old prisoner, A. A. J., was warned to take the various steps and will be tried within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw him do strange maneuvers by trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, as a spokesman for the California police patrol unveiled the People magazine.
The witness said that about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was leaning thoroughly on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and left his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the agents led her to the drug and alcohol centre to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was removed from the beginning, although "according to the observation of the police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested having been suspected of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of the Arizona clinic where she was hospitalized to treat herself with nervous depression.
Callazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Councillor of the Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of making favourable treatment for members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and this will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," he said regarding the behaviour of the political party that he will adopt in the City Council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left asked for the investigations to demonstrate "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Sangre de Mayo", the parie de Garci osé
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish battle against French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euro budget.
The filmmaker tried "to frame the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours," Sangre de May » will be released in the cinema halls next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Grand admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures that he had performed with this film "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to film a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was held to the national historical facts.
The €15 million provided by the Municipality of Madrid is a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been deceived as a leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having received funding as for the films "Capitaine Alariste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than twice the one obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he was unable to perform some written scenes in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated during almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Back to Start" influenced his usual way of working, on the performance of the actors, with whom he habitually repeats before starting the shooting and to whom he does not do casting, since it seems "humiliant" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times the Oscar candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "Sangre de May", "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner, "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "who would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, and then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're just doing another movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the sevillane dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillane dancer will pay tribute to a also sevillane dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She was a passionate life, a pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and plaida for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who has marked the history of dance in Europe of the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter suggested that I interpret the Swiss dancer Tortola Valencia and it seemed amazing to me."
According to the dancer, "we do not try to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
His dance titles made me think of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the serpent dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she says.
The performance was made thanks to two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his performances, as he had done at "The Open Door"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde turns Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me."
The performance was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were considered to be divas".
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially at the time, as in India, in the United States, or in Russia, but also throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it's these women who have enormous influence in their time and now no one knows and does not highlight his work," says Bayón.
The show will start at 8.30 pm at the theatre Lope de Vega
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Newly Married Poet's Day" in the church Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triannat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triannat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" came to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This people of light" which was inaugurated in May and which, after traveling to the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has purchased eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Poet's Day", published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most known Andalusian poets.
The least American without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of malice", and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of the whole of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had the trouble of getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been running since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, American esteem has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so harsh and without reason to live, there is only admiration for human beings and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He was incarnating for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug combat created in honour of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own bio food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had the difficulty of imposing itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Scottish Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to appoint Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He has placed the high bar for us," noted George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to pierce the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and far from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in today's media jungle.
But there is the one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married 50 years in Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though the opportunities did not fail him to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Among all the great roles he has interpreted, he has never been as proud as that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist," he says.
Madrid in the race at the organisation of the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid could organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of an eliminatory note.
But let us examine everything in detail and from the beginning.
The errors begin with the removal of the folders, which forces you to move forward.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it would be better than they give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They only made you go there to take the backrest (first mistake, move for it only) and (after a long waiting row) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy that little jerseys with less fabric and less cost?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your bag behind at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line of waiting, the competitions started and we had not yet left our bag behind at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rains accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults took place in the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me who, I think, did not correctly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, it would not come to me especially with the idea.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft's Emerging Technologies Conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing a few basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to travel on the company campus) in response to what was asked during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who are - including recalling which posts they occupy - and listening to and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But also bring them together according to groups of conversations
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she tells her she'll answer her in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked more about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many programs associated.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery as Microsoft, after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extracts" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google's first move to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be needed as this is the essential basis for the understanding of computer equipment and software.
He has the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth but as relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We only turn on the computer to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than through windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Which can be the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, busy months, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in the launch of its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken early this month in one of the restrooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet for information.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not go out in early 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the phone is increasingly like a computer.
But since Android's launch is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso laid it down on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio carried one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in 'Le Parrain' by Francis Ford Coppola and was part of the holding of the association of muscle gays.
And if we start to list all its appearances, we could also mention this mustachu rib that lifted weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple cotton, moulding and without sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as ' Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' distinguishes itself from others by his excellent cotton, by his unisex cut, by his distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (almost recognizable) that the most well-known body jerseys have in their neck.
But pay attention, because the Belgian brand not only produces top tanks.
But it also produces sweat-shirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babes, mini-shorts...
Dresses designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even though it's a shame to only wear them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who give their names.
It was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important prices of fashion than the Spanish sponsored house.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 60s enchants us and we inspire much for our collections.
I like to walk into town and watch women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do so often.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman: aren't you?
I believe that yes, but at the end of the day everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Ever since I was a little girl, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my dress.
Dancers love to dress up for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you wear the clothes, it's at this point that you really put yourself in the character's skin.
All of a sudden, everything is connected.
You didn't have 30 years ago. Was that hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s are happy.
I find the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoy life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me for it, and I want to be a young mom; I don't want to lose it.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and lift him with great love.
Let's go to the movies, you expect the different movies you played last year.
That's right, I've been looking forward to them coming out.
I'm a woman from the theatre, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like to have everything now but of course it's not possible.
I look forward to the films 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you'll think about...
A few days ago you started off on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to do the mannequin.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for a while, to invite me to participate in London in a charity show for her association in support of the women's support and the clothes we exhibited - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold for auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender person.
They say so much about her, I know her, so much isn't true.
Besides, the good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pier, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Flying alcohol recidivists will have to install the 'alcohol' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol abuse to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle in a state of drunkenness, or if he does not blow.
The initiative has already been announced in June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is to reinstate the driver by offering him road re-education courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety, but also the Directorate General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Motor Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, take the car.
Alcohol would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the breather and prevents the start of the vehicle if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the permitted one.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is charged to the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the offences in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This is due only to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with such behaviour before they turn into criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by regular means, but criminal reform requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Specifically tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 17h40, the scheduled official time, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Asturias Princes traveled landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of bed, but its rays still had to put their hands on the face to see the royal couple come down from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked in the street, the taxi driver, if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Oh, all right, so we can't just go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you in or so...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here thinking about two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several to wait in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military range of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in marine blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very heavily and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they have told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before going to the hall where the official court is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a journalist rigolo of Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
Surely there is no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no more wonderful and good-live designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of the new talents of fashion.
The winner will be rewarded with a price of €300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in Mango's window at the 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and she almost cried with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square metres of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier de Paris.
With as a nearby table of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and making against bad good heart, due to the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a dress of Mango and some of the earrings of ELAH, who cut the breath, and arms on it, arm down with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rothil ended the evening without a dress because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented himself to the store with a pair of pants and shirts – of her own collection - and who for dinner met with a sexy and black long dress, got excited when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsals room and recalling the good old time, she seized one of the bars and made the gesture of a large fold.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us earlier on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moved on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the Paris Intercontinental Hotel, with his sheets, towels and having asked in advance that there are no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, here's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The morning awakening almost saddens us when he sounds every morning at 7 hours, but it's even worse when we think about the agitated rhythm that imposes our present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no methods or methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But it's 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole menu of methods adapted to each's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the bookstores directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manuel' degrades such belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or natural recipes that help you relax.
If the adrenaline doesn't run into your veins to restore your body's balance and if stress has become a problem, it's time to sit in the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking in Sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I do not relate to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens, it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It's a benign disturbance of sleep that's called sleepwalking.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one who talks at night.
This may occur in a very sporadic way (once in life for example associated with a severe fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other sleeping disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal emuresis (pipi per bed) or somnambulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very severe fevers, stress situations or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that is not studied.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs, or on the contrary with screams, cries, long speeches...
In the event that sleepoloquia becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We said that this is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, except if it is related to another disturbance in sleep that can be taken care of (e.g., if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, seek calm games and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and so rests.
Remember that if he gets very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not be tempted to ask him for information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep, he's not aware of how to organize his thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, of the thought of how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even kidding.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the path of victory on his ground after a long period of dissect.
Without making a big game, the Jaunes and Blacks created the largest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this encounter where attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who frowned the lucar on a distant shot, Illhaeusern would slightly take the ascendant and turn around Fonderflick from far, then with Hirn above, Romain from the end of the foot or Diebold came to chat the defense of Dannemarie.
In front of him, we were building in the middle of the ground and we were just leaving the Riahi to the point of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time was going to be decisive with two occasions first signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and soon after the opening of the score for the Illousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball repulsed on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Ilhousian butterman will not be able to enjoy his long happiness and will be forced to return the lockers a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose major problems to an Illousian Eleven who just went back a little to "comact" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big humming, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy to meet angry fishermen
Before flying for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a hijack by Brittany.
In the face of the demonstration of force of fishermen who have greatly disturbed the access of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinac, in the Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of oil prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of the sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out sargot operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing caps of about 10 km.
The port of pleasure of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-Île did not stop.
A filter dam has been launched on the island of Quiberon.
The sailors have already demonstrated on Monday their determination by burning from dawn tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic façade and the Manche, as well as to the Sables of Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers stayed on dock, or to the Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Donges refinery.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held in the department to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday about the follow-up to the movement and participation in the planned interview with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go" and "do not want to move to Paris", for example, said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay tax on diesel, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they consider that a ship's profitability threshold is reached only with a diesel less than 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Beautiful
The novelist of Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes praised the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian airliner table on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the global economy's threat of recession.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircrafter delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, in particular for his aircraft from the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider assigning more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have endorsed, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to reimburse the $85 billion that has been advanced to it, according to the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its life insurance to the international and its retirement activity in the United States, states the newspaper which cites sources close to the file.
The board of directors of AIG met in the evening to examine possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from IGA.
Assets that AIG plans to separate include its airline affiliate International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer and its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision was taken on these transfers, followed by the FT.
AIG must quickly realize liquidity in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve to the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting in two proportion the current shareholders.
Analysis Paris History of the session Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall on Monday after the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson bank rescue plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq index yielded 199.61 points at 1.983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (to 106.85 points), at 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Bank Rescue Representatives to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was based on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would not happen "too late".
"If the project is actually dying (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the U.S. central bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, Chief Economist at Global Insight.
And further emphasizing the sense of urgency, "every day that comes to bring the fall of a financial institution to the United States," said Ms. Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benin, Iceland and Germany, signs that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," added the analyst for FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond declined to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% Friday evening, and 30-year-olds to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% the day before.
Obama, winner at the first TV show
In the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, another succeeded to find out who, by John McCain or Barack Obama, took him away.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democrat campaign QGs proclaimed their own victory in this TV show that would have been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, has not been "brilliant enough" to allow him to reverse his decrease in presidential five-week polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose a public opinion survey on Saturday, grants Obama a five-point advance (49% versus 44% to McCain), considers that it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
In the indecisive voters, who count, Obama came out victorious for 39% of the polls, while 25% of them win at McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the well-awaited performance of his collector, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
It has good instincts," however, Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventeenth McCain has always put forward his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing his opponent's "navity" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge necessary to be president," he also assured.
An angle of attack hammered yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that he was representing the future.
Without dismounting, he was concise and precise.
He has put forward his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still did not understand, while Obama, if", retorted, this weekend, a democratic spot reprobating the Republican not to have taken the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "U.S. of the Street".
"During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, said Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a beating rain.
He did not even say the words "medium class" or "workers." The financial route clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the edge of the cliff.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point," said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final eight-year verdict of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating that 95 per cent of Americans would still be able to reduce taxes despite Wall Street sobers, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that the realization of the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was her first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
The two candidates excluded questions relating to the $700 billion financial saving plan (EUR 470 billion) adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents manifested on Sunday night in the main place of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday night as soon as the polling stations were closed on the central place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to manifest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "How good, because they will do what they want with my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been a good figure for foreign observers in order to resume their language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if those elections were considered to be clean by the observers.
They weren't against the opposition.
"We have been held apart from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the clearing," said Iuri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is that it counts the votes, and in us it is the executive power.
If members of the opposition come into parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for legislation."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, comes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
It points out that participation figures appear too high, and that the generalization of vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, you asked the Social Democratic Leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night returns to the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
Interview - Red blood safe
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice because Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he restored the public's confidence that had been seriously undermined by the blood scandal contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public grunt, in February 1994, the Government of Canada instituted a public investigation, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such disaster to stop happening.
While Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan for a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has completed this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38 per cent of people still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
In an effort to improve the safety of blood and work products in the field during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said before proudly affirming that in early 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now trusted Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "confidence is something extremely fragile."
Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle from its establishment on 28 September 1998.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, were being dealt with in Europe.
"And we did not know at all whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports that when it is not known and a serious disease may arise, in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, therefore, the blood of those who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was denied.
A few years ago, however, it was shown beyond doubt that this disease was transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (TAN) that enable the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the blood of donors and not in anti-virus antibodies, on which the tests used until then were based.
The NTAs have been able to shorten the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
Thus, the risk of some donors being infected was substantially reduced without the knowledge and could not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV occurs by a blood product.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the security of our products.
We never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant," continued Dr. Décary before pointing out that in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Québec must also provide adequate supplies.
"Needs increase because the population grows older.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often require red blood cell or platelet recharge.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors, which is an average of only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Every person in health, aged 18 and older who meets the eligibility criteria, however, can give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is prevalent, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so scary, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving his blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec which also manages the only public blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord once considered to be a biomedical waste is a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth blood sample of cordon and it is expected to take more than a thousand a year.
We should start proposing this for grafts early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cordon blood sampling program as very popular.
"Mothers are disappointed they can't have access to it," because Hema-Québec has no means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The semi-final impact
The Montreal Impact has qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 victory in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, at the second and decisive match of the fourth round of the total goals, at Sapputo Stadium.
The background Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a first goalless half on either side, the David Testo and Rocco Plancentino field environment marked the other threads of Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
We recall that during the first round-trip match, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunder reached a 3-1 deficit in the game back to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps also joined the 5-4 half-final round in total goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victorious goal of Kovalev
The trio number one of the Canadians is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn fuelled the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win at dams in front of the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec raised two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, warned the Russians.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest placed on the North
The Prime Minister shall not exclude elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council was completed, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) attempted to be elected on the occasion of today's partial election.
"Repudiate the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was designed a kind of Moulin in images.
They turned around, on three huge screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Major means, as in the electoral period.
In the press, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would launch the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the recent Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister refused to explain why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential", but did not give due time, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: including hydropower, forest, but especially the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's listing.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's at our house, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, but it is in us," he insisted, as well as showing that he was demanding a national founder myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he has emphasized: the gold road in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's us, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has specified the Prime Minister at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity comes, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the northwest pass, which will open all year round because of the ice source.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pakis MP of Ungava), have already started consultations with about 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with that of the Liberal Prime Minister who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which started on Friday with a big cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rebaptize the Beauharnois Central in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, in Borassa who made the James Bay, our party knew how to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press release, he invoked another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest pointed out that its launch was planned for 2012.
"There remains among us, but I am planning to be there," he entrusted to his militants, raising in their homes nursed applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not dismiss the possibility of holding a vote this fall, which the law allowed him to do.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was fulfilled, including by a mission of the council of the federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that went as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the "speciality of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the broad lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
Pakistani leader Pauline Marois noted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, upon reaching power in 2003, gave up its application.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today," said Ms. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (the poll today), Françoise Mercure.
The AQA said it supported the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (O irony) in Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say to Louise Arbour that she was an "honest" for Canada.
To cast the reproach on this woman who has fought incessantly for justice and deserves all our admiration, she says as long as she is around the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one among all the Western countries involved not to have returned its citizen locked in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take any account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts he was being criticized for.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and lets a child-soldier collapse under inhuman conditions.
The only person who commits himself to a parody of justice to assess the accused's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, advocate for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that shuts its eyes to torture: it does not matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, no doubt ever after so many years of exactions.
We do not yet realize this, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper keeps branding and sounding so cruel in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morals: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the right will of a head of government until now minority (so it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that upholds the Truth, the Law, and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In his September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest goldsmith company has attempted a defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the envelope in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecution in defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to lead to the ruin of anyone who dares to support a stand against his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the editor of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defense and to fight, to very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
Tactical, in these unequal struggles, is, in fact, often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a regulation on the friendly who will banish the opposition in addition to oppressing anyone who will dare to look again at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually done with the exchange of ideas rather than with matriculation.
It was therefore sufficient to open its books, records and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and reject requests and letters of support from black Canada authors from the back.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could at the same time ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the views of that same audience?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word refers only to fat lawyers paid, not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or don't want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public who supports black Canada's authors and publishers is doing it first because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is prepared to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a prosecution-boat (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just placed a standstill at the authors of Black Canada urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's continuation is a direct attack on freedom of university research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in block, the right to quote credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that appeal to rich companies in this world in a country such as Canada, subject to prosecution, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by black Canada authors.
She has a right to reply.
The academic community we belong to has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's move clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms that limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Hear · Global Voices
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by the two Houses of Congress.
It provides for, inter alia, better control by the electors of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at wages paid to the executives of the rescue companies.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done in a way that has opened up the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do so, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on the American daily life will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned on the spree in the last few hours, fearing the effect that would result in a new failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, however, without failing to express their discontent that it is necessary to reach that end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that of allowing owners to keep their homes and that of the government-responsible business leaders.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be welcomed.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American television waves.
Asked about another channel to see whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The big lines that I read [show] is something that we're all going to have to digest and with which we're going to be able to move forward.
The choice to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the dubious, risky and invincible debts of the US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgages at risk (subprimary) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (CPAA) and leading to a liquidity freeze and the detonation of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans who had led to the first draft of an agreement last week.
It is believed to have come out of this impasse since Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only secured by the government rather than purchased.
In order to round up the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government was to make losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its release.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the President judges it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be endorsed by another vote of the Congress.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will be able to obtain participations in the rescue companies that will pay him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the storm passes.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for housing for the real estate loans involved in this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The architects of the plan would like him to be put to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plans will have green fire.
In fact, voices continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"Of course, Washington does not hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, at his electorate.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one to take advantage of taxpayers."
Animator of a small group at the Congress called "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presented things differently, but reached the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention by the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the BNP Paribas Bank announced that it had renounced its acquisition of its competitor in full shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (US 2.9%) in the U.S. venture capital lending crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
In exchange, a right to vote in the bank and influence is recovered.
It's just something that savers and households now appreciate the uncertain announcement of times."
Meanwhile, on the other hand, the British government seemed to be in the process of nationalizing another bank under the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would return all outstanding loans to the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than $41.5 billion (US75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be the one who would buy the branches and customer accounts of the UK bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed
His beauty in the eyes of the blue was long his card, no one will say his weakness.
Had he released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His stink, his sensitivity and a talent that flowed from source will also have removed him from the register of power that nurtures the true sacred monsters.
What a great racer!
Paul Newman, disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, following a lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of the American film of the years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and had long been a kind of screen rival, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostorate of the freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 by a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born.
Without egos, the last brand of quality.
Because in the early 1950s, a whole country with the self-made man, the war fighter of the Pacific, injured in combat, studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television, soon at the cinema.
The same man who was also the driver of civil rights was the second-class car driver at the Mans 24 hours in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The dark areas of this secret, discreet, engaged, allergic star are also removed with him, and the enigma will not be completely lost.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance sought the vertigo of the cinemas this weekend, as his great roles were intertwined on the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parade through it.
Back in memory, the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a suitable burning roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we refer to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have come to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Lices Me (marked by hatred), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, who was born after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathic malfrate in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's The Hustler (1961), he will resume the character on the return to Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which in 1987 was his only Oscar on nine appointments.
That face through the ages, it was him.
Again.
The times are boisterous through its path.
Young people know him mainly through George Roy Hill's cultivistic Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Brother Coen's The Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as sponsor of the Irish Mafia in the Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was sealed.
In contrast to several film legends that soon left the trade, Newman will remain in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its facades and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humour, "as a challenge living to "underplaying" judging his over-supported benefits.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles have long been cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the first young than the marginals: nevroses, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman reveals ill-known facets of his true pubic sensitivity.
Her husband, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew a fine feminine portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated to him his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of purity and sadness.
Among the rains of praise that took place yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former arms partner Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, deeply saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant features of the missing actor.
Beyond his career as a legend, he also became a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of Hollywood's drifts.
We will have seen a lot of his trolley on vinegar pots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of quite taste, although gag at first.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, has been engaged to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
They name the model, in sum and in sum.
What could have made Zuschlag &amp; Company in their invoice factory well?
On 8 October, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin, against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly serious damage, and other charges were brought against them, such as false and false use.
According to the public prosecutor's office, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipalities' money, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand in the caisses of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and, on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, which was also published by the investigating authorities, was to pay money for the subsidies obtained by issuing bills of fees, which were behind which no real benefit was provided and thus, the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoices from the Józsefváros market, while they produced the caches in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were about to be included in the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, conducted by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he called for an invoice, on the model on which they made the other invoices they were going to introduce, inter alia, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of Capital to access grants.
The majority of invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with drafting the files necessary for obtaining the grants.
One of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this site provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Foundation Jövőért, which subsequently bears the name of Együtt a Harmadik Évesredert, was grunting in form and background.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, had in fact only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night. Yet, the bill mentioned one hundred thirty customers.
The invoice issuers to the overflowing imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor the name of Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the parquet.
Győző Farkas, the company manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: "Beyond the shape, the fact that, according to the invoice, one hundred people stayed there, was not collapsing either, since this establishment only counts eleven rooms, which do not have so much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
Zele invoice issuers have also not been informed about Budapest's travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but are organizing only travel abroad. Thus, by no means, they have indicated stays in Hungary on cash invoices, which is also contrary to the agency's accounting practices.
In addition, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the travel activities benefits, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the rate of VAT of the four invoices established on behalf of Hotel Revefülöp in the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Furthermore, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the fakes were hand-written.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" have also made mistakes by mentioning as a provision the carriage of goods by road, that the issuing company of invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
Moreover, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of inadequate invoices and false caches, that invoices issued in the order of Együtt a Harmadik Éverdért Alapítvány of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfeherto's sports internship, which both deny to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Nor did the Faussaries pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to take a meal at their homes. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company refused to issue this bill.
Deliberate invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were required to issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták Group, established an invoice at the order of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évesredert, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003, issued invoices at the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület Association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of about five million HUF, but behind which no benefit was actually provided.
There was no financial movement either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies did not mention it in their accounts.
The next category of invoice-emitting companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the Director General of Delta Trió Kft, dealing with fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was impossible, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices concerning the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also send documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As we know, Kubatov recognized during his investigation that he had issued invoices at the order of Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évesredért Alapítvány, and that he had seized their countervalue.
It is precisely at Ivan Kubatov's request that Romanian masons have created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were working, as the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
He also used these companies, since, at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the founding acts of the companies, he established invoices to their names, to the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlas and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave to organizations, a total of 15 invoices issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The public prosecutor believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on invoices as well as VAT went to the Kubatov pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictional invoices that were used in the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarszágért filed a grant application with the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy for two times HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To prevent this from being known, five fictional invoices received from Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search in the office of Arpád Kemecsei, in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a part of the accused will report the method of making invoices, as she had already done before the public prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or if so, the socialists would have concluded an agreement that, in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would bear only the hat.
Today, the latter is likely to be seen, as applications for his supervised place of residence, based on an alleviation of his detention conditions, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf.
While those who have caused much more significant damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, await their own home at the end of the proceedings. He does not have this possibility.
Over-the-counter psychology: why do we spend more money?
In auction sales, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate merchandise.
Neurology and Economics researchers at the University of New York have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as a auction sale on eBay, and that is why they prefer to even pay a high price.
These researches attempted to develop a neurological pattern of this type of "game" using sales at experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played the loto, while the other group participated in a sale at playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance process (RMF), researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction sale, a key element of which is the oversales of a third, the whole under the brain trunk, called stritum, was moving intensively during the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why researchers believe that price rises are due to the leak in the face of the violent reaction of the stratum.
In support of their theories, economic members of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups surpassed a partner under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they did so.
In another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would get out of the game, then they would receive an additional $15 in reward.
While the third group received these $15 before the auction, the group also lost this money, in the event of their loss of the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed on one victory, while on the other, on the failure.
By proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the player team "against failure" were willing to take higher steps than those performed by the control group and the "to victory" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena found during auction sales only by the pleasure of winning and the parade at risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped eliminate the contradiction between the two theories, leading, now, to a third explanation." - found Andrew Schotter, the professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, the chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the first causes of death.
Patients with hepatitis virus in Hungary are estimated to be 100 miles away, but only seven miles after treatment. This is because the patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to liver-related infections caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and yellowishness are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are propagated primarily in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, vaccination against A and B viruses is also recommended. There is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, generally accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible yellowish, the seals become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die of the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know how to get to the virus, because pathogen destroys the liver cells in a subtle way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with C-type chronic hepatitis worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor treating from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
On 30 September is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the organizations representing the sick around the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to the chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does he who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article in which researchers at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experience by analyzing how much belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electrochocs, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
The results show that Catholic believers have been able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and disseminating electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with hermine painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, was about its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, they received 20 electrochocs in four successive parts, while watching either the religious theme painting, or the more general theme.
The Catholics said that, in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe" as someone to whom we "care" and they "sustained, and peace invaded them."
In view of the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% pain less than when they looked at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself has taken part in the experience, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided you find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image in front of which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Bishop of England, welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if a Madone painted by Leonard or a painter of the same caliber were shown to believers?
Would the view of a higher quality Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You're what you're spreading about yourself.
On the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found at the bottom of the people's pocket in the same way as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their centers of interest are.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While with respect to skeptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they do not see exactly the essentials of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated in the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for Google founders to meet their initial goal that sounds like: "Get all the information in a system of the world!".
According to Google's interview leader, after ten years of global chambuling work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will it be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the job that would be best for me?" However, the software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first sight, until the day they know enough about the users.
It is not perfectly clear to all netizens that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages subsequently consulted by interested persons are listed.
Through the Custom Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and can see what they have sought, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to provide much more personalized responses, and will submit products and services based on our previous declarations and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my work is? ask users, who are worried about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or possibly the rebellion against power that can arouse counter-reaction among netizens.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of netizens.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus enabling an identification.
Internet users concerned with human rights have been able to cause a sigh of relief last May, when Google, the arm on it with the EFF legal protection agency, has proved its right to the FBI. According to the judgement rendered, in the future, Google will still not be forced by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier. But ultimately, it fails to obtain lists of private users' searches, or the full list of websites and keywords of the past two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is flogged by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against the fierce multinational societies of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savage" bringing together the passionate, enthusiastic activists and users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "gendered incorporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as the invader of the world because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in view of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that the geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what Web 2.0, the most famous keyword in recent years, shoots just behind it.
In fact, web 2.0 is nothing other than collaboration, than the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use communication channels at our disposal, and while the dimension of them changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These youths can also keep blogs, in which their latest photo galleries automatically appear as they store on Flickr or on Picasa.
While you can get acquainted with many examples, such as that of the little friend who easily understands the pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the society that fired one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about the top management, one can be on one thing: the term of privacy is totally to reconsider our days.
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and that is how the principle can be defined behind the behavior of today's youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least, he wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, can do it (e.g. starting with Scroogle, using Google's search system, but at the same time, leaving no trace intentionally).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not less. Google's online services, through text processing to image processing, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and which do not resemble our best profile, which have existed so far.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding from it, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the increasingly high-speed benefits are causing serious migraines not only in Microsoft but also in many other computer program creators.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the enterprise motherhood and after the company has considered it too costly to restore multiple daily life, taken at any time. All this seems ridiculous in addition to the fact that Google has already acted before the Chinese government and according to the terms of its agreement, the company detects all the results that harm the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is about, is that in the coming months and next years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's book scan and archive project takes such important dimensions that society will soon be facing the US Supreme Court, others are shaking in front of its Health system, as in it, we can build a full medical benefit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give good raw material to the next generation of authors of science fiction. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tons, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a fascinating way only through Google data.
Two minors helped to remove traces of Ozd's double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. According to well-founded suspicion, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the department of Borsod.
Young people have recognized the facts they are being accused of, and for the time being, they are being accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to the information of MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, are free to defend themselves.
The complicity of murder can lead to imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect of Ozd's double homicide, a 23-year-old boy, was placed in pretrial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it was found that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that is why he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ozd where he killed him, as well as this young man's daughter, aged 9.
According to MTI's information, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is evidence.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw stock exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange stock package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish made even though the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State that wants to separate from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London stock exchange, and the Deutsche Börse have offered so far.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague stock exchange, said last week that among the interested, the Warsaw stock exchange would be the best new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague stock exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated at between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25 percent participations, followed by the 14.7 percent of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, increasing from day to day, European press leaders already refer to a "second 11 September".
"The global financial disaster is due to the President of the United States" - he accuses the daily life of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised to the va-life, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the emissary loop in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that led to the global economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system grows every day, and eventually the whole world will pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the Congress's vote, a real threat, the one Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - notes the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still hold a life-threatening blow to their fledgling financial institutions, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks collapse like dominoes, then financial means, and new improvisations will not be enough.
In the long term, we need the European Union's states to make few cases of their national selfishness, and to centralize control over the divided financial markets.
Only on Monday, the weakened financial institutions have received more than 100 billion euros - reminded the Vienna newspaper, Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands on the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses, in part, the old continent.
The "saviators" should not immediately shake 100 billion euros, but it would be appropriate if they noticed in which case it would be rational to pay taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing more damage.
The intelligent car imitate the bourdon's flight
What would be the best way to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle if it was not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
For example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, which took place in Japan, bourdonning bees gave the strategic idea of departure to Nissan engineers, to inspire them on how they must design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-robotted, BR23C-type system, which he has equipped with bees qualities, the ultimate objective being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee is its own space, of oval shape, which actually resembles much of our safe protection shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and the technological public relations of the brand.
The bee's face-eye plays a vital role, as it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the face-to-face eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies obstacles in a 180-degree angle and at a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C, it assesses distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid the collision.
Contrary to any existing system, this avoidance manoeuvre is carried out in an instinctive manner.
"If it wasn't so, the mini robot couldn't react fast enough to avoid the obstacle," says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for now the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must be carried out in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, only the rotating movement, acceleration and slowing as maneuvers made available to the mini auto robot could be used.
BR23C uses polymer lithium batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentrate is larger, making their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the intelligent instinctive reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should handle only a few incoming signals per second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-bytes of memory continuously.
There is no need for memory of a giga-byte capacity, or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards designing an instant avoidance technology. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter the serially manufactured cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver towards his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at buying the banks' dubious credits, and using them several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that during further discussions that continue until midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on the disputes that have existed for days and days around the plan to save a total of $700 billion.
"We made a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the US Chamber of Representatives, who said that there is no longer any more than to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Secretary of Treasury, Henry Paulson, commented on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question of the rescue of Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, on Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m., local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2:00 p.m., depending on the local time in Central Europe), but did not cause spectacular rise in the scholarships.
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also greeted the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved this night, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
Furthermore, the programme differed from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which stated that the $700 billion needed to be spent on the purchase of dubious credits.
The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the bill is passed by Congress, probably Monday. This first sum will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase dubious bank receivables, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The cost of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase dubious receivables, mortgages and suspicious mortgages, as well as other "toxic" types of receivables.
The department's competent persons have stated that purchases can take place as part of a auction sale, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools that cause the concerns, for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast purchase of dubious receivables, insurance, or avoiding the risk of seeing the system collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the law as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in bad positions and waiting for state aid can expect their starting allowances, simply called the Golden Parachute Beyond the Atlantic, to be captivated by the government.
Wages capping is mentioned only in very specific cases. Moreover, limitations depend on the way in which the Treasury secretariat proposes its assistance to the company.
The ceiling principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys in the context of a auction sale, they will collect a surplus tax on the gold parachute, unless the discretionary bank president is retired.
Directly after the purchase of dubious receivables, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not overstated.
For the image to be complete, however, it must be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only relates to new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force regarding the remarks of the directors-general - said the chairman of the committee in charge of the financial benefits of the House of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State provides a right to acquire shares in banks participating in the plan. Thus, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even be won in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will return on their legs.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress which will rule on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That is not why the American citizens sent us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican MP of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise

Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to those of a previous year, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of internal price fluctuations and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Internal industrial sales prices have only increased to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent, compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry have only increased by 0.1% compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), with first, the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 percent, then the production of shoes with 2.5 percent monthly increase.
The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing sector of chemicals and products (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimum increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry increased from 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, representing a significant weight in the national industrial operation, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the gas price established by the authorities since 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, the oil processing sector prices were the most significant increase (32.4%).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, there was an increase in prices of 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, drink and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions have occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacturing of machinery and electrical equipment (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the price increase has increased between 0.6 percent and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices increased by 10.2 per cent in the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7 per cent in the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and according to sector allocations, in August, the investment profit-initiating sectors showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and material-producing sectors for subsequent processing did not experience any change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase in energy and material production sectors for subsequent processing was observed (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, an inflation of 6.8 per cent was measured, while in the profit-initiating sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent was measured.
Export sales prices for the industrial sector in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent in 12 months.
In one month, our national payment rate decreased by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, and 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar. Compared to the month of August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that, by 12 January, the American-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will enter into force. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs has stated in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "maintaining, everything depends only on the moment that electronic access and control systems outside the Atlantic will be put in place".
Once again, it drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before the departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today's Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will give the decoration of the Commander Cross with the Order of Merit Star of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisors of candidates for the presidency, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, as well as John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, assured their support of the 700 billion government rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary to the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives at Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday afternoon, that they had concluded principle agreements on bank rescue.
This funding plan, aimed at breaking down the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even appear, each as fiter than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the introduction of economic issues, Obama has again managed to get some advance. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a columnist just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote on the 700 billion rescue plan law.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he too supports.
"Now it is necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a danger to your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
There was no lack of qualification for McCain's economic ideas of excesses.
In an interview with the ABC channel, McCain said, "We'll all have trouble swallowing it (...) but nothing to do is a way."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal mentioned the establishment of a Treasury Board and the capping of senior officials' starting allowances, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill as soon as Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The camp on the right is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that the voters have become more aware - as well as evokes the Der Spiegel, the low USC score in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers".
According to this recognized polytologist, the erosion of the CSU began well before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took its place.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now, these same modern citizens turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of the whole of Christian democracy, and thus also that of Angela Merker.
For the USC, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to have come to an end, just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the USC gathered 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be imputed to the modernization of "devoring its parents", which is established in the region in a manner consistent with the USC.
This has been announced for 40 years by sociologists, but they have been heavily mistaken about the rhythm. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of North and East Germans in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not be left without consequence of the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The field on the right is intact, it is only within the party that the voters have become more aware, more critical and more enthusiastic.
It is also surprising that during the last few weeks, it is precisely the groups of classic citizens who have instead moved away from the USC, such as the independents, the artisans, the box holders and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, USC support has declined below 40 per cent.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who ? With whom ? Party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of the issues of the coalition", the Austrian Conservative newspaper deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian socialists of the SPÖ want to discuss with the conservatives of the ÖVP.
ÖVP forbids SPÖ to interfere with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens still do not want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, everything now revolves around the coalition; during the debates organized on public television, party leaders have barely let their cards open.
Werner Faymann, president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the ÖVP, as Vice-Chancelier, remains open by Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer reacted with caution to the red proposals.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to get involved in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In its part, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is at the moment a very open question, which must be discussed in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," said Haider.
Jóroka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began in Paris, the host of which is France, as representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In his message before the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the consultation of experts, Lívia Jóróka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to the segregations in education, as it is a violation of the right that most affects Roma children and thus one of the main brakes on their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies, in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of MP FidesZ Popular Party, Jóroka has warned that, in addition to the distinctions found in the hirings, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of elementary education of poor quality, only a small part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education degree."
Járóka also stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in asserting other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of the European Union member countries.
According to the European Parliament, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in a widest possible circle, also between the Roma and non-Romans.
In fact, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market, and by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"By their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and sectarian education." - said Lívia Jóroka.
According to the honourable Member, collaboration by the European Union towards an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of de-gregation of schools, and for this, compliance with existing and pre-emptive anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and the opportunities provided by democracy for Roma children must be given so that they can participate as citizens of the right to the future of Europe" Jóroka demanded.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the goal of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe held annually from the summit in Berlin last year is to ensure a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination, which are targeted at the European level and at the level of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transition period
The decision on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo dechu will be taken in October.
Despite this unfavourable election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The party's president, Erwin Hube and the regional government leader, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of tandem, having suffered a loss of a catastrophic voice of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the convention of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair, in any case, felt that they did not especially hold their seats.
As a result, they worked to appease the angry members of the fraction and the base, which one day after the "sunami Bavarian" required personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it's true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength is left.
For 46 years, the USC has been the only sovereign of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still have a strong role in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal redevelopment of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, has also received a place in this modest group of recognition, which initiates tandem discussions with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange nose of fate was that, using the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as a possibility of putsch performed by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then to treat without home the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, the CSU leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far drew the straps in the backseats, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the USC, appointed on 28 September as the day he loved the most of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a few bitter remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will be able to be a chancellor only if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by fiasco, the loss of CSU land will not negatively affect the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relatively, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured USC, and the socio-democratic crisis always lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivals : 110 - 0
No member of the opposition has acceded to the Belarusian parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegality of voting.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation made up of 110 people in this country of 10 million had been very successful in opposition for decades, before the elections yesterday, the opposition uniting its forces as the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as President for the fourth time in dubious elections, would "allow" this time the presence of a few members of the opposition to parliament.
In this way, ODSZ gave up its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian political order qualified as an anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians did not receive entry visas, was one of the opposition's expectations. Belarus had to take credit because of the ever more expensive decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, and thus contributed to the passage of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipelines across the country, was passed by the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in the course of the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the prohibition to appear for a third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior calming.
However, the OSCE communiqué on Monday had already challenged the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were taken.
Despite all of this, the opposition is still a tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize the southern Ossetia and Abaziia separated from Georgia. Or, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories already for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevitch to our newspaper.
According to the candidate for the opposition of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains, even though "power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to have even one opponent enter".
The opposition does not include protest actions in the light of the results, but rather attempts to deliver its message on the need for economic reforms to electors.
"Of course, we have a lot of concern on this side: we need to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the wheels for what is diffusion, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported retirees does not consider it appropriate anymore.
"Because of the debt of the country and the rise in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'recalling the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time" - Milinkevitch says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers qualified for democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had no turning doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But from today on, this new measure is in force against the little machines, against which it points and then will drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
Today, the anti-faint novelty has been presented by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The turning doors- tell Brunetta- are a tool for better working, with more productivity, more presences and more services" said the minister.
Now a new season of responsibility and transparency begins.
"It's about reformism" points out also Brunetta.
The installation in all institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is even important from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General assures: "it is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7am in the morning is an excellent and safe resolution".
At a conference at the School Superior of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister reports that "in three months, the absence of public employees' disease has been reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand workers more than one year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "of which wage dynamics - the Minister has explained - over the past 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined in challenging the standards of decree Brunetta using Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today expands the data on the drop in absenteeism in the workplace because of illness- written the association of consumers- the people of "active hungry" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the proper and productive Public Administration met to declare the war to the illegitimate standards contained in the Decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of disability due to service is challenged; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's stay, during which inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents on the workplace, Napolitano: "Crime prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
Inail data confirmed in 2007, that the white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures testify to the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to get the attention of the institutions, social forces and the means of information on this dramatic aspect, Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents on Labour, institutionalized the second Sunday of October.
"Anmil's disturbing data, as well as the tragic events of the past few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention at work," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the ongoing association effort to prevent workplaces, the protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness of public opinion."
"naturally independant, everyone has punched in to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the everyday reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, our attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber pointed out to the extent that this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each one of us, and requires all the institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
Labour accident data seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being even impressive" the President of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli later emphasized.
"we do not want this "tendency to the low" to actually translate into less attention, because it is just when attention relaxes, that tragedy comes.
"we believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"In our opinion, Mercandelli - more checks and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added, "There is still a need to make an effort to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
" Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the expected compensation for the victims of work" and the "derived from the assistance to which the system has been taking place in recent years."
"The objective, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - so that the fate of the one who has an accident, must not depend on the spontaneism or the extension of the legislator"
Mp3 reader pointed to the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to music in full volume for a prolonged period using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent injuries to the hearing.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a press release in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Cssseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report- let's read in the note that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than an hour per day and a week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones in full volume can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to scientific data, the EU is responsible for a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What counts most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing systems of control in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientists-concluded the executive Ue- confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100Db, but there is increased concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reduction of levels and length of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee Ue notes that users of portable music, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, are above the current limits on the maximum noise level agreed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their numbers can be quantified for about 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germano gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we finish, in June we will draw the money.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other Commission components will develop the directives for Rome.
In March when they have completed, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp " of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all the political, social and cultural ideas are represented here - it wishes to stress Germano - it will have to propose ideas for development in Rome to be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, she will have finished her work and will then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time frame.
In June-announcing the Mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its views will not be binding, German replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France, thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often the policy is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see from the front, and beyond, towards a deeper prospective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Germano, in fact, "there is a need for a strategic, firm, and immovable draft of reference, in order to enable our city, to improve itself, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit."
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first U.S. President. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to go independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the side of his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he always has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "this person is full of ambition".
Obama is really sloppy: he believes he will gain the highest function of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In reality, these are attacks that don't say much; of course they are attacks of a racial nature, and they don't answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have polls, all of them saying that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
That's what emerges from an aspect of American mentality kept secret to the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: If Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things that have never been revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were Bush's errors during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent home to kicks.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's point of weakness.
Who will take George W's place will have a huge spot to accomplish.
Usa, the economic break is even felt in journalists: in the press, it's time for the suppressions, and many accuse the Internet, this "murder" newspaper paper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists were asked by the POW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not openly stated to the information officers, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is an economic model crisis destroyed.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work in the assembly of the newspapers, are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we want traditional journalism as the general public understands it, to be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses take a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as "the killer" of the paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to putting themselves in the technology hoping that she "dos something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest acroc in American journalism lies among those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage decreases to 23%.
For some, it is related to the "security of work".
Directors who consider losing their jobs within 3 years are 47% at the national level.
With regard to journalists, we're going to 30%.
The one of the "safe work" at staff level (nos editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a question to take or leave.
Directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 million a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, U.S. journalists are often "bad" during the year.
It's a lack of climate.
UNIPOL:CRIBUNAL ROME, DANILLO COPLA RESISTING GROTTAFERRATE.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for banking in the framework of the Unipol-Bnl Escalade instruction.
During his trial last week, he had obtained the mandatory house arrest in Grottaferrata.
Her lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel from the city of the province to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such travels (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to evidence that accuse him.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already taken place a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the 700 billion dollar rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and he was even more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms it by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its moderate East Coast vigour, favourable to federal institutions and to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to " Washington's" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, precisely, which became despotically felt with the vote I was talking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just an example of the changes, of the major changes that the current economic earthquake anticipates, or it already allows to run: not only the United States, but throughout the West, and it may not only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomenon that has been covered for some time, so that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary revival, of the dual sovereign state category, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for who governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here nationally.
Political internationalization seems really out of play or has little to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union which, shared as usual, between various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide any common political lines.
And so it is from the government of each State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all credit: when we go through a difficult period, there are only those States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis is still in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a rather related factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of non-materials, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized once and for all that our future would have to settle its accounts more and more with the rather little material things like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is, the one who has the evil of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
Now I come to the second novelty, which nevertheless provides for a fracture.
He who says Territoire, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and hence Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a discretionary wave for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved to be inadequate and full of shadow.
And also, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus, it further increases the conviction of the various classes, before actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far to their support, how to listen and be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
in short, The demand for leadership, subterraneanly nourishes, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimates of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "revolts" or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter all the time, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of workers in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not come by chance).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say, are still more difficult, which does not give rise to today's problems, to understand and thus represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis increases, increases and potentially acts in a medic fashion.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated.
But it's good to say, keep your eyes wide open, it's not without reason.
The supercolle to walk on the walls.
Win the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With a sticker measuring only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
ETUDE- The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a specific carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a stack of spaghetti." Explain Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hair that enables the animal to be a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Téflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "is easily detached from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
MARCH ON THE MURS? –"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on walls like Spiderman? It may be that yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian researchers have presented an adhesive made up of microfibres as hair, which self-cleans dust during the movement on a surface to ensure perfect adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juices.
Attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, mainly consumed in the summer as desalitants and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital medicines, alter the amplifying or decreasing absorption as the case may be, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in box or fresh, associated with the intake of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: it is enough a glass of grape juice, orange and apples, to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, cancelling their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Pamplemous juice has already been strongly criticized because it is responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, staminal and neurological drugs up to toxic levels.
MEASURES A RISK- It is the Italian Medicine Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to be under assessment of the danger arising from this mix and to be careful that you drink, if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba's appeal, director of the pharmacology department of the Public University of Milan, "these discoveries are generally immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the drugs you take, and, if something is not clear, do not get impressed, but to make it clear to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert pointed out to Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in the Economy was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Kennese who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest criticisms of the Bush administration's foreign economic and political solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of the bankruptcy of Enron, Krugman had written in an article published on the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that ran out of many polemics, and was blamed on the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memories of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive divulgeer, especially critical to the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of OpenOffice.org.3.0 broadcast, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to touch more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost one year, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with a variety of new features: from the welcome screen, and from the revised interface and became less austere, to some more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version.
Open Office has paid special attention to the interaction with Office 2007 and it is possible to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain functions specific to certain modules, such as that which allows you to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful, for example, for sending them by email, or for importing PDF files into the graphics development module, preserve the original aspect of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format chart with elements of a spreadsheet or text writer.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the modifications, in the development of texts, as each contributor is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should produce the final result.
The Italian version is unloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is usually also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation CD may be shipped to the home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of freeness can be a means to spread it in the homes, it is precisely in the business that Open Office is the next one that is facing the big challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Without counting the realities that provide a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word equivalent writing video; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint rival presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Objective for 2008, to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, it will even be possible to exceed the projected figure.
Kohl too, is positive, that's the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber's jersey.
It is the site of the daily The Team that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, as well as Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's specimens are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter analyses confirm Cera's positiveness, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years to be eliminated.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the Third Generation Epo was confirmed by the leader of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, that he had notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus sharpening the pea shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NOW YORK TIMES ASKED IF ITALY IS RACIDED?
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
This would turn the Beautiful Country into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times is about, which devoted a long article debating the theme of racism in Italy, from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where we register "more integration and work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support to the North League"
To confirm the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislation required by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegals is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Trend highlighted by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked that the state and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market does not know about crisis
According to the latest investigation of Sunia, the tenant's union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects at the point of excluding the whole categories of young people, from the right to study due to the very high global costs that families of origin must support - the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the high demand of students has distorted the market so much that a process of generalized increase has begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free, unregistered contracts, no rent limit, sublocations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax taxation are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Black Band Zone), to an average value of 800 (Lambate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria Area)
In Florence, an average bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room of about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students focus in the nearby areas of the University, it takes 250/280 euros for one bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas near central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), approximately 600 euros are required for a simple, 450 for a double bed.
slightly lower values (550 euros for a simple one) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
It can only be saved if you move away to the peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed, and 450 for a simple one in the Predestina, Centocella or similar area.
In Naples, it takes 300/400 euros for a single bed, from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, there must be 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the citadine economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra community students, have a subsequent anomaly: the rent requested for foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italian students.
Adieu old cinema Paradiso, the cities provide the historic halls.
Historical cinemas close to multiplexes.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind town, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the great Italian urban centres, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalizing the cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of the great multisales, and the death of consumption of the mono-rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems to us to be inescapable and undisputable; in addition, it has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historic places that are charged with memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of road and so many emotions" observes the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and who told the poetry of a province hall, and the nostalgia of a way to live the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the leading trader's association, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that have paid the most: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is headed by 82 lost mono cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-story cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy over the past five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exploitation has developed in an irrational way" observes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it is also necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a firm room in a city, these visitors are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplex.
Without talking about the lack of credit for traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not comply with existing laws.
In order to support the sector, between €16 million and €18 million are needed per year.
We note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first such in Italy, to defend and promote the mono cinemas of historical and periphery centers.
Among the proposed regulations, there are tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and in some parking spaces.
"It's an initiative that pleases" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
However, it is clear that, in contrast to the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" to which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have had so many shared emotions, I turn from the other side to not see the black panels through the dust.
Links between politics and ‘drangheta, arrest the mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the mayor's choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy charges are brought by the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabre, towards the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for Mafia Association.
The handles also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little lawyer son, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"a fight against legal and moral norms, and especially common sense," wrote the prosecutors, both local governments had expressed the desire to pay for consultations with Master Piromalli.
"In this way, the clan - written by the judges - would have been granted to enter officially within the city halls to facilitate the opportunities, already considerable, of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Agazio Loiero regional committee, only hides "collections between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in its region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of drangheta, heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests followed last July's, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a coalition of right-wing centres, after the ballet of May 2006.
He called for scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, the accused of manipulating everything for a political issue, but, given the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in asking for the variation of the A3 project.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the authors, emerged "the willingness to combine the requirements of a businessman, representing a more known group, close to the Piromalli, uniforming the public administration's choices to the interests of the clan.
When energy rises from waves, the big ones are now launching.
This is a well-equipped deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the major global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have set their eyes, and now they're trying to get their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When oil prices dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now ecological forums and the new increase in oil give rise to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 estimated that 15% of the world's electricity requirement could be covered by operating systems of the sea houle.
This would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colosses on the attack.
The first marine energy company was Enersis, which in 2005, signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it would have been said a genuine revolutionary step.
At two years of this, more and more candidates among these companies who have always been dedicated to traditional energy put on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said the spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil colosseum, the Wall Street Journal economic daily, and he assesses the opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a project to operate marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the way of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested so far, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about technology at the beginning, on the other hand, that marine energy does not dispel fear of the environmental impact.
Currently, systems such as Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major problem in the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technologies must be used with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave push, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure drives a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through cables under the sea.
For now, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used at a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping centre and a parking lot using six marine turbines from the East River of New York.
The movement of water during tides, turns the turbine blades, creating a rotating movement that nourishes a generator.
Verdant announced to have a long list of customers waiting for the authorizations necessary to extract energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, deserves at the moment the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tide is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely about the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the shores, invested $7 million and half a dollar in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million in 2009.
