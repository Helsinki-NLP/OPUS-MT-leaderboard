The cumulative coronary artery disease (COVID-19) that is increasing rapidly in the European Union/Wilayah Economi Europe and Britain Raya, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incident in the case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) showed a similar train in the United States of Europe/Wilayah Economi Europe and England, which confirmed that, despite the different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemics developed very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care unit, it should increase the number of people to spend the COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a classer case of pneumonia with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On January 9, 2020, the T-T-Kyokok Disease Control and Prevention Center reported that the taustif agent of this disease was a new coronavirus now called a 2-weight acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence thus far shows that about 80% of patients with COVID-19 suffer from mild, or respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, with most of them recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 developed into a more severe disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of other cases experienced a critical condition requiring intensive care.
Mortality of patients treated at the hospital due to COVID-19 about 4%.
In this study, we studied a COVID-19 country cumulative train in Europe/Wilayah Economi Europe (EU/EEA) and English Raya (UK) and compared it to an incident in the Hubei Province in Tiokok.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases currently in the EU/EEA and UK to the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and UK
After Tiokok, the COVID-19 has been geographically distributed further and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemics in other parts of the world are now following the pandemic dynamics in Tiokok.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans in the case of the COVID-19 confirmed based on WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 by the returnees from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiokok.
On 15 March 2020, the case of COVID-19 has been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020, including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents in the case of COVID-19
At European Center of Prevention and Disease Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported across the world are updated every day at 8.00 p.m. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the State Health Department, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate the COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare it with the train in Italy.
As a proxy for the prevalence of active COVID-19 case, we count the 14-day cumulative incident, so calculate the natural voyage COVID-19, in each EU/EA and UK country, in the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported by each country until 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to the Italian case during the period 31 January–15March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
The 14-day cumulative trend in the EU/EEA and UK is usually followed by a train in the Hubei Province (Thirdkok) (Gandrum 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the COVID-19 cumulative incident began to rise about February 21, and then increased to about February 28, 2020 (Additional Year).
This train is mainly driven by rapid increases in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and UK show a similar number of cumulative increases in COVID-19.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data suggested that, until March 15 at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases equal to the total number of Italian cases three weeks before or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported increased rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
A observed train at the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicates that the pandemic is increasing at a rate equal to any country.
This is out of the range of stages that have experienced countries, varying responses to health, and possible differences in the definition of a case between a country and a protocol difference to choose a patient to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes a referral test.
Early March 2020, physicians in the affected Italian region explained the situation about 10% patients COVID-19 needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 case receipt data in the hospital and/or intensive care unit at the EU/EAA level are only available for each 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
However, the data must be collected in a systematic way to complete the current survey data that focuses on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
Studies carried out in the year 2010-2011 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care and treatment of the Madya in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 populations in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and nursing for the 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario related to the severity of health care capacity, with the prevalence estimate of COVID-19 rate inapap for each EU/EEA and UK countries that relate to risk >90% exceeding the capacity of intensive care bed, provided at a six-fold ECCDC rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Because so far the most classy cases in certain areas in the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve specific regional service coverage populations, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the level of the Unit of Area for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the current train in another country shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of patients COVID-19 requiring health care, especially intensive care, such as in the affected region of Italy.
As shown in recent ECDC's rapid risk assessment, rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is very important to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from delayed approach to mitigation, because the increase in rapid cases, as anticipated, may not give the decision makers and the hospital sufficient time to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if it does not apply before.
The rapid risk assessment also exemplifies public health steps to increase the impact of pandemics.
There is a short window of opportunity when the country has the possibility to further improve its control efforts in slowing down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EAA health care system is likely to be on-site with a patient in need of intensive care in a few days or weeks to come.
The disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Turkey and elsewhere in the world, which has caused disaster for humans.
Similar to the homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and caused symptoms similar to similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower level of disease and mortality than SARS, but more contagious and older than young people, and more on men than women.
In response to the increasing number of publications about this new disease, this article tries to give timely and comprehensive examination of the subject of rapid research.
We're going to discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope that this examination will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Semi Festival on January 25, 2020 has been a memory that has never happened and is not forgotten for all the Tionghoa people who were asked to stay at home during their vacations and weeks later because of a new virus disease.
The virus is very homologous with coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and it was referred to as CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemics began in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with over 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died in the world.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the enemy of number 1" and potentially destroying more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that establishes a virus that is isolated from some patients, more than 200 has been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This study aimed at measuring research in this rapidly growing new subject.
Possibly, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other COV diseases, which are Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, plague in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and prognosis of disease and some other unanswered questions, but they are urgent.
According to tradition, CoV is considered a non-lethal pathogen for humans, especially causing about 15% of the population 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered a highly pathogenic CoV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing an outbreak that started in Tiokok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with morbidities and horrendous mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is the third COV plague in human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the first known cluster of pneumonia was reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, as CoV was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemics spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the health care infection reported, which indicates that human-human transmission may occur.
On 23 January, forty-five districts were held in Wuhan city and the entire public transport was stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of this disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients directly competed with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered an early site of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague as a global health emergency.
When this report was written, the disease has spread to the whole of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).
Because the situation is developing very quickly, the final fit and the plague's severity still has to be set.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centered study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients COVID-19 confirmed, provided an updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at the age of 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people over 50 years of age, only a few under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected people under 10 years of age.
More SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 extends into a classer, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes about 5 (2-9) days from time to time until diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the clock to the death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic reproduction numbers (R0) are 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, according to the time of massive transport before the Semi Festival in Tiokok.
Patient mortality with a confirmed case of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the most appropriate mortality for all patients of 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender, age (≥ 60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large-supply virus subfamily that contains single RNA sense strain.
CoV can be divided into four genes, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein tonjolan or spike (S) connects to the receptor of the cell, enzyme angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) and peptidedil 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The genom RNA virus is released into the cytoplasma; after replication of the virus genome, the genomic RNA is accompanied by glycoprotein sampul and nucleopacid proteins form vesicles containing virion, which then undergo fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% of the 10 samples that are administered; the sample is taken from the site of the outbreak, namely the Huhanan Sea Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through electron microscope transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in epithelium of very thin human breathing channels.
ACE2 humans were found as a receiver for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S SARS-CoV-2 protein is associated with human ACE2 weaker than its bond with S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes non-segregated SARS-CoV infection in patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new orf3b orf3b short protein and a secreted protein with an orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of virus and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not have a functional domain or a known motive.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a full human cryo-EM ACE2 structure in resolution 2.9 and in complex with the amino carrier B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformation, is composed of dimers and ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which are evidence of recognition and CoV infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original and the intercessor
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each is transmitted to humans through musks and camels.
Using the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic comparison with another CoV, bat is considered the original SARS-CoV-2 for this new virus 96% identical with two SARS-like CoVs of the bat called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, an interferon that helps virus cross species barriers to infect humans still unknown, and transmission routes still need to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as a carrier of bat viruses to humans who involved homologous recommendations in S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiokok, suggest that grinding, mammals have long ants that are commonly used in traditional Tionghoa drugs, potentially as an intermediate angel SARS-CoV-2 based 99% genetic homology of the CoV found in casks and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the differences spread across the genome are still a huge difference; therefore, the conclusive result as evidence of concrete has not yet been achieved (Gb. 3).
The physicochemical nature of SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar qualities.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and hot light at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, chlorine, assay acid, chloroform, and other fat routers, but not chlorohexidine, effective disabling viruses.
Generally, the entire human population does not have immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and because it is vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies report any immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another study of CoV before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
Generally, after invasive anang, the virus is identified by the immune system with a pattern (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receiver, Toll-like receiver (TLR), NOD-like receiver (NLR), and RIG-I-like receiver (RLR).
Through different pathways, viruses thin the expression inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and interferon synthesis type I (IFN) that restricts the spread of the virus and accelerates antigen phagocytosis by the macrophag.
However, N protein in SARS-CoV can help virus avoid immune response.
Shortly thereafter, an adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
T-Limphosite, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to viruses, and CD8+ T cells kill directly infected cells.
T-cell helpers produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, the CoV can slow down the T-cell function by subscribing apoptosis to T-cell.
Humorous immunity, which includes complexes, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in fighting virus infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from patients who have recovered have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large amount of free radical locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, failure to the mosquito organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, marked with the toilet classer, more about the age of a rapist and pregnant woman.
Typically, people who spread viruses in large numbers or who are affected by their immune function have a higher chance of infection than others.
Estimation of the average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on study of 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as explained above, shows that the 4,8 incubation period (3.0-72) day based on demography 8,866 cases.
It is of utmost importance that health authorities adjust effective quarantine times based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent infected people, but without symptoms, from transmitting viruses to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to viruses or infected usually have to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended for up to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early COVID 19 symptoms, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, breathing, muscle pain, swelling, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after illness.
In severe cases, the development of patients’ disease is rapidly becoming acute respiratory syndrome, septic symptoms, metabolic assidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who have fever and/or acute breathing and fever, even without lung imaging, have to be shielded against the virus for early diagnosis.
The demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that 98% of symptoms for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for spleen, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients need ventilator support.
Similar findings are reported in two recent studies, namely studies in family class and classrooms that are transmitted from asymtometics.
In contrast, the 2012 demographic study showed that the patients of MERS-CoV also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the primary symptoms.
However, 80% patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients, and consistent with the mortality of MRS higher than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13-25%) was shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support required for approximately 14%-20% patients.
Until February 14, COVID-19 mortality is 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to that, SARS mortality on November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality of 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
The previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with confidence interval (CI) 95% up to 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV was only around 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in symptoms, mortality, and R0 was given in Table 1.
Those numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but does not eliminate MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV pandemic.
Yarns of class are often found in one family or in one group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have travel history or live in Wuhan or other affected areas or have dealings with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before sunset.
However, it is reported that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms of more than two weeks and patients sent from the hospital can carry viruses again. This leads to caution to increase quarantine time.
At the early stage, patients have normal or decreasing white blood cell counts.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and aspartate aminotransferase and increased viraemia were found in 1,099 patients COVID-19.
The heart and muscle enzymes and hemoglobin increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood levels increase in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels increase, which is the product of fibrin excretion in the blood, and the amount of lymphocyte decreases progressively.
A variety of chest photos were found in the large number of patients COVID-19 and marked with bilateral objects or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occur, tactical inflammation, accumulating fluids, and progressive fibrosis greatly exacerbates the disturbance of gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumosis function lowers the surface level and increases the surface pressure so that it lowers the ability of lungs to develop and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Hence, the worst finding in chest photos is often parallel to the worst level of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first COVID-19 pathology analysis showed pneumocyte dissection, hyalin membrane disintegration, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, as well as sinitial cell in many patients who died from this disease, consistent with pathology of virus and ARDS infection, as well as pathology analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used as the primary criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to false negative levels, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
Similar situations also occurred in SARS diagnostics.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is very important and a necessity to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the protocol for the basic use of SHERLOCK to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected the RNA SARS-CoV-2 fragment in 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a cell stick within less than one hour without needing a complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly enhance sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with new COVs, especially doctors offer support to patients COVID-19, while trying to try various therapies that have been used or previously proposed for other COVs, such as SARS-COVs, MERS-COVs, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral, immunosuppressant, steroid, plasma from cured patients, traditional Tionghoa drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from a cured patient is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At the beginning, SARS-CoV-2 especially attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
But dysfunction and failure to breathe are a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is very important to relieve symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on disease levels.
Patients with severe breathing symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) oxygenation, which is the thermodifying kardiopulmoner orientation technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and protection of vital organ function is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune systems are known to cause a cytokine storm on SARS and MERS patients.
Locekin storm is a systemic inflammatory response that is marked by the release of the sitekin series, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
Sitokin-sitokin these subjugates the immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the primary cause of ARDS and fail to perform the mosquito organs.
Immunosuppression is very important in the management of a cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroid and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monochlonal antibody, has been used to handle a cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression for cytokine storms includes modulation of the immune response given to T-cells; IFN-, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibis; blinatumomab; cytokine signals 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are often used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are useless for severe lung injury to SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can cause heavy side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which strongly affect prognosis.
However, short corticosteroid supplies at low doses are being encouraged to be carefully given to a chronicly ill COVID-19 patient.
When writing this review, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenously remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found in a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, retreading the disease caused by the Ebola virus and Marlburg.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition of the other single-cell RNA virus, which included the MERS and SARS virus.
According to this, Gilead provides this compound for Tiokok to do a series of tests on the infected SARS-CoV-2, and the outcome is highly awaited.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as a potential therapy for patients with acute breathing symptoms.
Diare, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
This therapy interaction with other drugs that patients use should be monitored accurately.
Plasma of cured patients and antibodies
There is a long history of the patient's recovery from infectious diseases to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to prevent the healthy person from suffering the disease.
True, patients who have been cured often have a relatively high level of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodi is immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize the unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COPID-19 and injected to 10 patients who are seriously ill.
Their symptoms improve in 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and weight of the virus and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be done to submit these methods for large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
In addition to its therapeutic effect, some plasma-related deficiencies need to be considered accurately.
For example, antibodies can stimulate excessive immune pressure and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low and plasma is required in large amounts to treat a chronically ill patient.
Specific development and production of antibodies with fast enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have been cured and identify genetic codes that provide effective antibodies or make effective antibodies to proteins that are important to viruses.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effects largely depend on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula is different depending on the diagnosis of disease based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify the components or the optimal combination.
Currently, because effective and specific therapy for COPID-19 is not yet available, TCM becomes one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms until now or for people who recover from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be spelled out for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest level of well-being in COVID-19 patient therapy was observed in some provinces of TCM in 87% of the TCM, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM only in about 30% of the COVID-19 patients, had the lowest level of recovery (13%).
However, this comparison is still very harsh because many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his friends fertilized a study that compared western drug therapy (WM) only with WM and TCM combination therapy.
They found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, the loss of symptoms, and the pace of the inap was much shorter than the WM+TCM group alone.
More impressive, the drop in symptoms (from light to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and mortality is lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, TCM effectiveness and security are still waiting for more controlled trials on a larger scale and at more research center.
Another interesting thing is to identify the working mechanism and clarify the effective components in the CTM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most of the patients who were suspected or confirmed by the COVID-19 were greatly afraid of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and those who were quarantined also experienced boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Further, such symptoms as fever, hypoxia, and coughing and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroid can lead to greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phase of the SARS plague, a series of morbid psychiatrics, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor symptoms, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicideists have been reported.
Contact history and mandatory quarantine, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 disease, can cause people to become more concerned and feel guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental - health care should be provided for patients of COVID-19, those expected, and those who argue with them, as well as the public in need.
Psychological support must include the identification of a multi-discipliner mental health team, a clear communication with a routine update and accuracy about the SARS-CoV-2 plague, and a therapeutic plan and use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important in inserting transmission chains from animal and human reservoirs infected with vulnerable swimmers and are often equipped with antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by viral outbreaks.
The effort has been made to develop S protein-based vaccines, which, in the long term and effective, make an antibodies penetration and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, a life-to-life vaccine has been evaluated on an experimental animal.
However, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the age and model of lethal challenge and its protection against zoonotic virus infection must still be determined before clinical studies begin.
This is probably because SARS delayed 17 years ago and no new cases reported since then.
On the other hand, the sporadic and the Mers classer cases continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to another region because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic areas.
Vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS using a virus that is disabled, plasmid DNA, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombination protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on experimental animals.
The safe and effective development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunity people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to cope with due to a long time to develop dynamic vaccine (almost 18 months) and a dynamic VOC variation.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show the full clinical trip to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover without a single jaw.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with morbidity and high mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the development of a prognosis model of disease is vital to the health care body in order to enhance its service, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients COVID-19 (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also happened for COVID-19.
COVID-19 especially occurred at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% patients over 50 years of age in studies with 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have drug addicts and complications and significantly older age than patients who do not need intensive care (66-year-olds versus 51-year-olds), which impose age as a predictive factor for the final outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Female type: SARS-CoV-2 more infected men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Komorbidites and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer acute heart injuries and arrhythmia.
Heart events also mentioned the main cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be related to collaguositics with ACE2-positive, which can result in heart dysfunction in the COVID-19 patient.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are highly correlated and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory evidence: C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or tissue injury and is proposed as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between the CRP and severity and the COVID-19 prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, the increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartat aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and kinase (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and heart dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Fotothoracs and development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict the end results and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroids are immunosuppressives that are widely used as an injection therapy for infection to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of this disease end up suffering an avascular osteokinosis with a lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dose and short-lived dose in patients with COVID-19.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 plague, many patients suffer extraordinary stress because they have to endure long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and watch the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on a demographic study so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to the other COV that causes seizures.
Therefore, in the early or incubated phase, infected patients can produce a large number of viruses during daily activities, which cause great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most of them do not occur at the early stage.
Thus, the current COVID-19 plague is far worse and difficult to control than the SARS plague.
Currently, a major effort is being made in Tiokok, which includes forty Wuhan and the surrounding cities and quarantines, with almost the entire population in hopes of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this has been a major economic and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients has decreased, which indicates the spread of an epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate states that the plague will end in March and the decline phase will last for 3-4 months.
Some, though, were not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be far more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
Canada's research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-conka vortex and throat patients who had been cured and returned from the hospital two weeks before. This indicates that the newly identified virus can be repeated episodes, similar to influenza.
Even so, promising signs occur in China, if seen based on a decrease in the number of new cases, which indicates that the current strategy might be successful.
Ebola is predicted to cause one million cases with half as well as death.
However, with quarantine and tight isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe, like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus not too pathogenic to be associated with humans.
Compare the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic below.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also by direct contact with substances contaminated by viruses.
This virus was also found in a phase, thus triggering the possibility of a new transmission, which is a wave-in-the-blank transmission.
Recent studies in 138 reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health care providers.
Hence, proper precautions must be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even people who happen to be in contact with patients or infected ones.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both scalps and N95 respiratory masks (the number of 1860-year-olds) to control the spread of viruses.
The surgeons must ensure that the sparks of a potentially infected person are not affected by the air or are attached to the surface of the material, which can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (Series 1860-year-old) masks can protect against inhalation of virion with a size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can fully detect; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, both of which are approximately 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even five surgical masks that have been implanted into one, health care providers that are directly related to patients should wear N95 (Series 1860-year-olds) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear a healthy isolation cloak to further reduce contact with the virus.
Virus can also infect someone with eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore N95 masks; the virus may enter his body through the eyes.
Therefore, the health care provider should also wear a facial shield through the eye or glasses while working with the patient.
For public communities in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfected soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for independent quarantine, and avoid contact with people who are potentially infected.
Three feet away is thought to be suitable for keeping the patient at a distance.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a great warning to the Chinese that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS plague.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Whah Disease Control Center calmed the population by saying that this new virus had a low level of preaching and limited reproductive capacity from man to man and prevention and disease conservation was not a problem.
This message is very reassuring to the public, especially as the whole country is preparing for the Semi-Semi Festival, so that the critical time has passed to stem the disease that is still small in Wuhan.
The disease - control body in Tiokok should draw lessons from this and make great improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the population and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to non-normal information than clinicians, than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorized officers; (3) more restricted to build potential epidemics at the early stage, and not trying to calm the public; and (4) more often release targeted and effective training in order to increase public awareness of the epidemics and test and increase public response systems periodically.
The COVID-19 plague was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started to take on at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout China and over 50 countries in the world at the time of writing this survey.
Because this virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV and the COVID-19 and SARS symptoms are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak is re-occurred.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important in building an epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 is more about the age of young people and more about men than women, and the level of death is also higher than that of young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
The COVID-19 patient transmits the virus even when they are without symptoms, while the SARS patient usually transmits the virus when they are severely ill. This makes it more difficult to block the COVID-19 distribution than the SARS.
This explains some of the reasons SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
The routine RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results to some patients COVID-19.
On the other hand, a cured patient can give further positive results to the virus examination.
This finding poses a real threat to the spread of the virus.
With such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some important problems still need to be solved, namely:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although genetic homology was found 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two similar COVs-SARS bats, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What kind of animal is the intercessor species to provide the virus from the original ring, tell the bat, to humans?
Without knowing answers to numbers 1 and 2, we can't send transmissions effectively and the plague can shoot back any time.
Although molecular modelling and a lot of biochemistry show that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the breathing channel cell and lead to subsequent pathology changes?
Is this virus also linked to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic take?
How does the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Is this pandemic going to be a global pandemic, end up like SARS, or repeat periodically like flu?
The answers to the questions above and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, at any rate, we have no choice but to end the epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
The zoonotic source of the human crown virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved the co-evolution of the Crown virus (CoV) and its ring, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoV) were known to cause mild illness, such as selema.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Central East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveals how much HCoV infection can be very damaging and threatening the soul.
The SARS-CoV-2 construction in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoV a resounding and surprising us with a high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis. Therefore, the understanding of the origin of HCOV zoonotics will benefit us.
Most HCOVs come from bats.
Some HCoV midwayer vessels have also been known.
Identification of animals has a direct involvement in the prevention of human disease.
The investigation of the coV-inang interaction on animals can also give important insights into the pathogenesis of coV on humans.
In this review, we present a general picture of the current seven HCoV, with a focus on its discovery history and its zoonotic origin and its interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compared and retracted the HCOV from the perspective of evolution and genome recommendations.
The 2019 CoV epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, successful swimming conditions and the involvement of virus evolution in disease disorders are also popularized.
Corona virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of RNA viruses hiding, inducting positive, and single.
This virus has the largest genome with a size of 26 to 32 kilobes among the RNA viruses called "CoV", because of its morphology that resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
Based on the structure, CoV has an unsegmentated genome that has a similar definition.
About two thirds of the genome is made up of two large open rows (ORF1a and ORF1b) which vary in size. Both are translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replica.
Polyprotein has further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining genome consists of open read (ORF) for structural protein, which includes tonjolan or spike (S), bottle or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific complete proteins for specific lineages are also presented by various lines of coV descent.
Based on differences in protein sequence, CoV is classified as four gene (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four gene, the beta-CoV gene has the most HCoV and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
The phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and predators are a source of the majority of the alpha-CoV and beta-CoV gene, while the fungus is the main gamma-CoV and delta-CoV reservoir.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens for humans.
So far, there are seven known human CoVs.
Among the seven viruses, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other five beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, a heavy acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), a central East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as pills and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing heavy respiratory tract infection on relatively more patients and having a higher chance to develop into acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lungs.
Strain HCoV-229E first, B814, is isolated from the ingus of a patient who was ill in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through a thorough study of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both of which have caused healing symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak occurs.
The SARS outbreak that took place in 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in today's history, which infected over 8,000 people with an estimated 10 per cent gross death rate.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a continuing epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spreads to other parts of the world.
HCoV new 2019 (2019-nCoV), next called SARS-CoV-2, is a kausatif disease disease-ochronous agent 2019 (COVID-19), which has taken life more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
Alarm is ringing and the world has to prepare itself for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins of bats, mice, or pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of the evolution of all HCVs from bats. In bats, CoVs are well adapted and nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a great challenge for the medical, scientific, social, and morals of the Chinese and all over the world.
The trace of the zoonotic HCoV gives the work framework to understand the natural history, the driving force, and the reconstitution factors of intersecting species.
This study can also guide or facilitate the search for an animal reservoir, an internavigator, and SARS-CoV-2 amplification, which has an important involvement in future precaution.
In this review, we give a general image of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenosis.
We specifically recommend and discuss the general topic that HCoV’s parent virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but it becomes pathogenic after transmission of interspecies to the new angel.
We also review the HCoV evolution train that increased transmission capacity often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The final result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 the first of the ingus patients affected by the disease, various CoVs have been isolated from infected animals, which include turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In some of the last roots, seven HCVs have been identified.
The short history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
Strain HCoV-229E was first isolated from the patient's respiratory tract that had an infection of upper respiratory tract in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to be implanted in WI-38 lung cell.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed symptoms of fever, including headaches, sweats, nausea, and throats, followed by fever and coughs seen in 10~20% cases.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequence pathways in the brains that still submerged.
A clinical description of HCOV-OC43 infection seems to be similar to HCoV-229E infection, which could not be compared to another respiratory infection such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread all over the world and tend to be broadcast the most during the winter in the current climate.
Usually, time incubation of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by illness for about two weeks.
On the basis of a human volunteer study, a healthy person infected with HCoV-229E suffers from mild spleen.
Only a little patient with a weakened body immune system that shows a heavy low respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as atipis pneumonia, is the first HCoV documented well in human history and its etiologic agents are SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first case SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tiokok.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spread in many countries and continents.
Apart from the superintendents, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incompetence of 4 to 7 days and a peak of the burden of the virus on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV were initially suffering from myalgia, headaches, fevers, nausea, and choking, followed by dyspnea, coughing, and breathing disorders as further levels.
Lymphopenia, abnormal heart function tests, and kinase creatine enhancements are abnormal labs in the SARS.
The damage to alveolar diffuses, the proliferation of epitel cells, and the increase of macrophage is also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal, heart, and kidney can also be infected in a heavy case, usually accompanied by a cytokinic storm, which can cause death, especially in patients with weak weight.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of patients with zeros traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, efforts have been tremendously dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was at first very common in young, elderly, and infirm patients who were suffering from respiratory disease.
Coriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronkiolitis live are depicted in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from an 8-month-old son's nasal specimen that suffers from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Despite being identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually spreading around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% general respiratory disease and the peak of the event occurred at the beginning of summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called the body.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from 71-year-olds who had been treated for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchitis, HCOV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma abuse.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 found worldwide, causing mild breathing.
Four HCoVs of this entire community have adapted with humans and generally have a small likelihood of mutating into a highly pathogenic disease. However, this is an unusual case for unknown reasons, as in the recent case of HCoV-NL63 more virulen subtypes are reported to cause serious respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when you have the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend yourself within humans, these HCoV virulence and pathogens also decrease.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from 60-year-old lung patients with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the confirmed laboratory cases come from the Middle East, the import case with a time of secondary contact has been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The Mers clinical manifestation is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which has been explained by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients have also suffered acute kidney failure, which so far has only occurred in MERS among the diseases caused by HCOV.
Over 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases are reported with high case deaths, which is 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most frightening viruses known to humans.
At the mid-December 2019, a classer of respective pneumonia patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the infection of ongoing respiratory tract infection was caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named the COVID-19 disease.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a death rate of 3.4%.
Reportedly, the death of the case in Hubei, Tiokok, is 4.2%, while the death of the case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with the images of fever, coughing, and breathing.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop quickly into acute respiratory disorder.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of high nucleotide sequence homology, 82%, both of them flock to a different phylogenetic tree branch.
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is clearly lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subject infected SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms has been reported and may play a role in the fast SARS-CoV-2 distribution around the world.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCVs shows a very interesting similarity and difference.
First, the incubation and duration of travel of HCV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows another six HCV general train.
Second, the CoVID-19 severity is between SARS-CoV and four other HCOV communities (such as HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of HCoV infection in the Community, which includes a mild or even unspecific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infections even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting pattern characteristics, having similarities with community HCOVs and SARS-CoVs.
On one side, the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is at least as high as the community HCoV.
On the other hand, decreasing the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 after some lines in humans still needs to be verified, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like any other HCOV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a phase sample.
"Is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in a certain situation, it still needs to be clarified by further study."
It's also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the community's HCoV case.
In any case, the images of SARS-CoV-2, which include transmission capacity, pathogenicity, and continuous circulation in some pathways in humans, will have a strong impact on the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 plague.
Four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCovs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be HCoV endpointers of ancient times.
HCOVs that have caused severe human illness and people with severe HCV disease have been wiped out.
In order for this to happen, HCOV must replicate in humans in sufficient amount to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations to be used against an angel-combating factor.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 disease survives and more people are infected, the more likely this virus is to be fully adapted with humans.
If the virus is properly adapted, transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
Over the years, four community CoVs have moved out of human populations and have triggered a fever in people with immunocompetence.
This virus doesn't need animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are highly pathogenic yet to be adapted to humans and their transmissions in humans cannot be maintained.
Both have to defend themselves and do the bombing in the zoonotic reservoir and look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or some of the intertwiners and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted as community HCoV, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and is not as pathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It still has to be observed if SARS-CoV-2 will be fully adapted with humans and blended into humans without an animal reservoir or a midwife.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary angel, natural, resource, intermediate, and HCoV amplification.
Animals act as a HCoV evolutionary angel if they have close relatives and share high homologies at the secondary level of nucleotide.
The ancestor virus usually adapts well and is nonpathogenic in this angel.
Similarly, the blood vessels carry HCoV on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, the angel is naturally infected and is a natural angel for HCV or parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV has just entered the intermediate ants just before or around time the virus enters humans, the virus is not adapted to new and often pathogenic.
The intercessor's memory can function as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an auspicious enemy by enabling the virus to replicate temporarily, and then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV can have a fatal infection if it cannot maintain transmission in the middle.
On the other hand, HCoV can also be adapted to the internavigation angle and even cause long-term ambience.
In this case, the middle angel became a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data retrospectively reveals that the case of zero SARS has a history of contact with the animal.
The subsequent seroprevalence investigation indicates that the animal salesman has a higher IgG prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
The moon mossang (Paguma Larvata) and the raccoon dog at the living animal market is the first time identified with a similar virus-SARS-CoV that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the merchants in the market were killed.
However, it is reported that the moon weasel of wild or undisclosed farmland to the market for living animals largely yields negative test results for SARS-CoV. This indicates that the moon weasel may only act as an internavigation fan, but not the natural resorption of SARS-CoV.
It has to be noted, because 80% of animals in Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be observed that many small mammal species may also function as an SARS-CoV intercom.
All this angel seems to be an end to SARS-CoV.
A natural animal search for SARS-CoV next reveals a close-neighbourly related COV, which is called the Rhinolopus bat Rhinolopus relatives HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is in the T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T.
Thiswar yields positive testing for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and sequenced SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomes.
This coV and other bat CoV share secondary nucleotide homology 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study became the foundation for a new concept that bats are an angel for new human pathogens.
Some CoV-SARS (SL-CoV) are also identified from bats, but only one, given the name WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 that comes from a bat fesses sample is shown using ACE2 bats, musks, and humans as a receiver to enter the cells.
Interesting, a convalescent SARS patient can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, with secondary nucleotide homology of 95%.
Apart from the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the direct parent virus SARS-CoV and bats are not the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups the MERS-CoV into the same group as the CoV-HKU4 bat and the CoV-HKU5 bat.
CoV-HKU4 bat and MERS-CoV use the same anang receptor, which means peptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as a virus entry route.
The sequence of RNA polymerase depends-RNA MERS-CoV phylogeneticly closer to its compliance with beta-CoV bat identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no Mers-CoV lives were found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and close relative CoV-HKU25 bats only share 87% secondary nucleotide homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct meRS-CoV reservoir.
On the other hand, the study in the Middle East showed that Arab camels yielded seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like those from the Middle East in some African countries.
The Mers-CoV lives that are identical to the virus found in humans are isolated from the strains of the Arab camel, indicating further that the camel is a real reservoir for the MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that mass virus delivery with symptoms that are usually mildly observed on the test camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It needs to be noted, the infected camel releases the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for the spread of the virus from bats.
However, the question has not yet been answered because many confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, the possibility of human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown species of animals that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 share 96.2% nucleotide homology with RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the secondary difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to establish parent relationships.
In other words, bats may not be a direct reservoir SARS-CoV-2, unless COV is found almost identical in later days.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 is one of the species of wild animals sold and killed at the Great Sea Food Market Juanan. Many of the early cases of COVID-19 are linked to this market, which indicates the possibility of transmission of animals to mankind.
Some recent studies based on metanomical sequences indicate that a small group of mammals threatened with death, known as trengilling (Javanica Manis), may also carry an ancestor beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2.
This new Genom CoV is divided 85-92% secondary nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to RaTG13 with 90% of the same size on a nucleotide-compliant level.
Both are grouped into two sub-line viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which shares the reception domain (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a similar amino acid severity of 97.4%.
What's remarkable, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much more different, although the level of homology is consistent with the entire higher genome.
Previous study in sick treggilling also reported a detection of the contiguous virus from the lung sample, which was also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted a different teaching method and a manual study to produce a partial genome sequence consisting of about 86.3% complete virus genome.
We can't limit the possibility of twirling as one of the animals of the saRS-CoV-2 intermediate animal.
However, at present there is no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 directly from trinkling due to a serious difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 flying.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathways in bats, trinkling, and other mammals still have to be set.
Although the highest homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trengilling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shared the highest homology at the secondary level throughout the genome.
Too speculative if it is said that the level of similarity between RBD beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trinkling and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by a convergent evolution that is selectively mediated.
The comparison hypothesis supports the reconnaissance between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trengilling and RaTG13 species of third wild animals.
As a driving force for evolution, a lot of reconnaissance has occurred between beta-CoV.
Researchers still can't decide about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Apart from HCOV, which is highly pathogenic, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63, and HCOV-HKU1 have also been tested.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from the bat CoV, while the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 parent virus has been found in the feeder.
It is reported that CoV bats called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected on bats three colors North America shows close stability with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to the other bat CoV, with the name Hipposideris/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with the expected Camelidae is also the intertwiner.
To make it clearer, today's knowledge of the origin of HCoV animals that are known to be contained in Figures 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of HCoV's interspecies transmission in history.
In about 1890, when HCOV-OC43 crossed the species of livestock to infect humans, it was reported that there was a pandemic of respiratory infection.
History of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is not too clear.
Alpha-CoV bat related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Between them, there's alpha-CoV alpata.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of viruses from bats to humans.
First, humans, not the avocados, who may be competing with bats in the ecological shelf together.
Humans, on the other hand, have a close contact with the alphabet.
Second, alpha-CoV bats associated with HCOV-229E are various and nonpathogenic in the bats, while alpha-CoV alpapa causes respiratory disease to infected animals.
Last but not least, alpha-CoV alpaca is not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the alpaca is likely to get alpha-CoV relatives-HCoV-229E from humans can't be overlooked.
In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
It is not surprising, therefore, that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Other possibilities, while alpha-CoV bats function as a HCOV-229E extension gene, avocados and Arabic camels may function as an interferon that transmits viruses to humans, exactly like the Mers-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is a very good example for the transmission of interspecies from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
In addition to the MERS-CoV evolutionary of bats known in the early identification of the virus and also reinforced with subsequent discovery.
Clearly, bats are the lengths of rich virus species for the exchange of interspecies genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
A long age, a mixed colony, a strong social interaction, and a strong flying capability, all are conditions that support bats to be an ideal 'viruser'.
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV has been in the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has been adapted with camels that have changed from the middle ant to a stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains relatively low rate of mutation in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happens by chance and humans remain the ultimate angel for MERS-CoV because the transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of the camel in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of trinkling, if any, in different SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Especially, the beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in treggilling.
It's probably a final angel for the beta-CoV relatives of SARS-CoV-2, similar to a muss in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible SARS-CoV-2 interspecies transmissions from animals to humans should be calculated or withdrawn.
First, bats could be a reservoir for a SARS-CoV-2 kin virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological repellents with bats through drilling or mining.
Second, trembling may be one of the internavigation rings for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2 kin virus.
Humans get viruses through slaughter and consumption of poultry meat.
It's possible, many mammals, which include pets, vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies survey of pets and wildlife needs to be done.
Three, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that compete well with bats and trinkling.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 animals is still ongoing.
Apart from various species of animals, three main factors on the virus side are also important to make it easier to pass through species barriers.
First, its rate of relative mutation in RNA replicas.
Compared to another single single RNA virus, the rate of CoV mutation can be considered "currently" to "high" with the average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per step, depending on the adjustment phase of CoV to the new angle.
CoV has exoribonukease corrections, removals that cause very high mutabilities, attenuations, or even merciability.
Interestingly, the known Remdesivir nucleotide analogue suppresses CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribunukease and RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the rate of CoV mutation is about one million times higher than the rate of the wave mutation.
Moreover, rate of mutation is often high when CoV has not been adapted with an angle.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of mutation, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, according to a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another angel closely associated with humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV which has been adapted with Arab camels.
Theoretically, the small possibility that genetic leaks will quickly make vaccines and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 become ineffective.
Second, a large RNA genome in the CoV gives extra flexibility in genom modification, for mutation and recombination, so that increases the likelihood of co-evolution of interspecies, which is beneficial to appear new co-V at appropriate conditions.
This is supported by the many unique open readerships and protein functions marked to the end of 3′ genome.
Third, a random pattern-changed CoV during RNA replication through a unique "selected-saline" mechanism.
In the wave that functions as a mixing vessel, the rotation of the camel usually occurs during the RNA CoV transcription.
Complete RNA and very homologous subgenomics can experience a new CoV recommendation.
Natural phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in CoV animals such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
The interaction of viruses in connection with transmission
In addition to three factors of the virus mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the receptor is another major factor affecting the interspecies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV recommendation is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection evidence during the interspecies transmission event.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and musks, SARS-CoV is expected to undergo rapid adaptations in various angels, especially with mutations in S protein RBD.
Generally, RBD S CoV protein interacts with the receptor cells and is intensively a target of an antibodies response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is amino acid from 318 to 510 in S1, which is connected with human ACE2 and the co-receptor as a virus entry route.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, musks, mice, and rakun dogs, allowing transmission of the interspecies virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues observed are different between human virus isolates and musks in RBD and 4 of them located on the receptor ignition motifs for interaction with the ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV musang has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of protein tonjolan interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It needs to be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receiver as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit involved the S protein binding affinity with human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows the affinity of human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV-2 protein 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV protein.
What's also important to know is whether there's any other co-receptor that might be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interesting thing, HCOV-NL63 is also tied to ACE2, but to a different part on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-O-teraethylase acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after the interspecies transmission of the animal's ring.
In addition to the receptor cells, the end result of HCoV interspecies transmissions is also regulated by the dependency factors and other limitations.
The difference between human and natural reservoir, such as bats, Arab camels, and animal breeders, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoV must take over the power-dependent factor and break down an angel-restraint factor to succeed in the interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular checks on the interaction of these important viruses still need to be identified and explained.
Extinguishing the entire genome is not sufficient to see the dependency and containment factors of the SARS-CoV-2 using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCOV appearance: return to the beginning of the plague
The bat CoV personality gave great opportunity to appear new HCoV.
In this case, the bat CoV functions as a HCV extension.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also motivate HCoV evolution and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, a new protein filter gene may be affected by a drastic modification of phenotype viruses.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was expected to play an important role in adaptation to humans because of the virus of the relatives-SARS-CoV virus that was isolated containing various ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with special characteristics of 29 nucleotide removals found on the strain isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that supports a swing.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV descents, with a large number of smaller areas of recommendation identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Locations also identified in nsp9, most of which are nsp10, and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the reconnaissance of various lineages took place during the MERS-CoV epidemic, which took place in Arab oats in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the occurrence of reconnaissance has also been observed at other HCoVs where HCoVs are recombining with other COVs in its non-structural genes.
It should also be kept in mind that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes to viral genomes, likely caused by the release of the virus from the pressure of selection, such as the immune system.
This example of effect is the complete ORF4 missing on HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While full ORF4 can be observed in a bat and camel virus related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpapa shows a single nucleotide sidepan that leads to a pattern shift.
Finally, new HCoV evolution was also driven by the pressure of selection in his reservoir.
A light or no symptoms detected when the bat is infected with CoV, which shows an adaptation between CoV and bat.
Looks like bats are well adapted with CoV in anatomy and physiology.
For example, disabling in the effectiveness of pro-inflammation response to bats will reduce pathology that CoV is taking place efficiently.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is stressed due to the rise of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer receptor regulation and the molecular expression level complex histocompatibilities of the lower I class.
In addition, the high reactive oxygen (ROS) species of high bat metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and influence corrections by exoribonukease so that it gives selective pressure to produce very pathogenic strains of strains of the virus when entering the new anang.
A more pathogenic strain of CoV may also develop through recon, which results in the release of protein or new protein fibers for the adaptation of the angel.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that the new three HCoVs have appeared in the last two stages.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes light symptoms in his blood vessels, such as bats and camels.
CoV replicates with strong without triggering a strong immune response.
Here lies the secret of a carrier without symptoms and the cause of a serious human infection.
Especially heavy symptoms because of excessive immune response and cytokine storms, with increased lung damage if the immune response is becoming stronger.
On the other hand, on the carrier without symptoms, immune response has been removed from the CoV replica.
The same strategy for deciding the involvement of the immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The most powerful interferon response on bats.
Therefore, the interferon type I gift, at least at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activity in bats is defective.
For this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be beneficial in the handling of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appearances follow the general background of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the beta-CoV bats that share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there is also the CoV bats that share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although other animals and animals in the market were found to carry an identical virus with SARS-CoV, the ring of direct internacional for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
Beta-CoV trending which is very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which shows that treggiling may play as one of the intermediate or beta-CoV straining may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Though still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by either man intentionally or unintentionally.
CoV is back into the center of attention because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 plague.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoir for HCV on human transmission.
Many evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and is transmitted to humans through the middle ring.
Considering that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and wethouses in the wet market, maybe wet market closure and murder all the wetlands in it that effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, trinkling should be transferred from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, considering the discovery of some beta-CoV strains that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanics are transmitted to humans through twirling and other mammals still need to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV has been in Arab camels for a long time.
This camel works as an important transport tool as well as as as a main source for meat, milk, skin, and product wol for the local community.
Arab cattle spread across the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all the camels to control MERS, as done in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the Mers disease, comprehensive approaches must be made to develop vaccines for effective camel against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we get rid of this virus, a new genotype can appear and cause a plague.
The different zoonotic CoVs are out in the wild.
Especially, coV bats that are potentially zoonotic are very diverse.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience recombination, which leads to the emergence of a new, easier-transmitted and/or more deadly coV for humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China had to be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and plan of deployment must be put into practice.
Actually, many viruses have been on this planet ever since.
These viruses are in their natural reservoir until there's a chance to spread.
Although the bats have many features that support the spread of the virus, human opportunities run with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
The ongoing surveillance of mammalia needs to be done to understand more about CoV ecology and its natural ring, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future plague.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the zoonosis of the virus is for humans to keep the distance from ecological extensions of natural zoonotic viruses.
Some parts of the zoonotic puzzle SARS-CoV-2 have not been found yet.
First, if bat transmits SARS-CoV-2's ancestor virus to treggilling, the condition when bats and strains share ecological elongations is important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans compete with bats must be determined.
Third, if there's a third mammal that plays a real midwife, the way mammal interacts with another species, which includes humans, bats, and spins must be explained.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, either attempted infection and surveillance should be performed.
Whether bats, tremors, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its mother's nearly identical virus can be identified in its natural ants in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this field will derange the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary path in animals, with important involvement in prevention and control of the COVID-19 in humans.
Update of "expected case" diagnostic criteria and "confirmed case" COVID-19 needs to be done
On 6 February 2020, our team published rapid guidance for diagnosis and management of new 2019 coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to combat pandemics worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, awareness and knowledge that is growing based on ongoing research findings and practical clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are being updated as well.
In this letter, we answered one comment in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "expected case" and "confirmed case" based on the Code of Diagnosis and Control for COVID-19 (the seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is now formally referred to as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called a kronavirus heavy breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed fast counseling guidance and the guide has been published online at the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
These guidelines have long drawn attention to the way they are published.
However, it needs to be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and knowledge that is increasingly based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are being updated as well.
For example the Guide to Diagnostics and Controls for COVID-19, issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, this commission has produced a total of seven editions with a large part of the context.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
The results of their work added to the new evidence for our guidebook and provided a valuable reference to this worldwide pandemic.
We supported their meaningful work and expressed our appreciation for it.
However, their work also required updating based on the most recent (verting the seventh test) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the expected case, a combination of one epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations is required to make comprehensive analyses, or to perform three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history or reside in Wuhan city and its surrounding area, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the emergency; (2) contact history with SARS-CoV-2 case (by positive nuclear acid test); (3) contact with patient who has a fever or respiratory disease from the city of Wuhan and its surrounding area, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the emergency situation; (4) contact history with the class of the confirmed case (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or breathing symptoms that occur in 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or breathing symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection citriculation features; (3) total white blood count indicates normal lymphocyte counts, decreases, or decreases at the early wet phase.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the expected case with one of the pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) the positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire genome of the virus shows high homogenity for known new coronavirus; (3) the positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or the change of specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from negative to positive, or the titer increases ≥4 literate in the recovery phase above the level in acute phase.
We can see that the real-time nuclear acid PCR test in the blood or respiratory channel sample is added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020); and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the ongoing research of researchers to find optimal nuclear acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the breathing channel including blood flow, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the collection of specific positive antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more evidence to remind us to watch out for patients with typhoon symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. chart should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in practice and clinical studies in future.
In closing, we hope more direct evidence will appear and ask readers to comment.
For the "expected case" and "confirmed case", we suggest to follow and obey the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also update our guidelines on time for help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day as a result of that virus.
Up until yesterday, Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported a number of reported infections involving 114 active cases and 33 home-based cases.
Totally 17 deaths.
In an overview of the online news, director IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that death covered four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41 and 50.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of the deceased was the Saifur Rahman Road, director of Bengali Anti-Corupsi Commission, who was treated at the Kuwaiti Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a online video announcement, Minister of Road Transport and Bridge, Obadil Quader said public transport would be stopped longer than originally planned, until Saturday is coming.
This public transportation stop has begun since March 26th and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4th.
Transportation of basic necessities -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection incident reported in Bangladesh was on March 8th, on two new arrivals from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, those three men were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by a coronary virus.
The top occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first Crown virus infection and Zambia had its first death related to the Crown virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free of the infection of the Crown virus.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Middle European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of Crown virus have been reported, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reports, which cites data from Johns Hopkins University, there are over 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by crown virus infection.
Around the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, extended the region by 40 to the 1st of May.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians would remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament made a vote to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote was passed with 215 supporting voices, ten abstaining voices, and one voice refused.
Saudi Arabia extends the nighttime in the holy city of Mecca and Madinah to all day; before, it only occurs between 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand plans to apply nighttime between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the order to live at home until May 1st.
Australia's Toko store lowers the purchase limit of the toilet tissue for transactions
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australia Woolworth and Coles network each lowered limits on the purchase of toilet tissue to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also applies the limit of one sir, on Monday.
This flag was announced as a message in the casserole and on the Facebook page of the network.
The buyers reported to increase supplies due to the fear of COVID-19 if the people had to make independent isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet tissue to send home to one pack per order.
This change follows the four-pack boundaries per previous transaction applied to Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In his statement on March 8, Coles reported that, by means of the four-paking attack, "many stores have been running out in an hour since the shipment", and called the request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unforeseen".
The sale "highly sharp" last week, according to one of the speakers speaking Woolworths.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed until two weeks ago.
To avoid a shortage, Coles ordered larger packaging than a installer and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of Australia's Steel Association, said that the oil was trying to raise supplies, but the local government's body limits for delivery time made it difficult.
He anticipates the increase in production costs, while the vendors try to meet the demands, and less special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since it had released earlier supplies, some stores could not create a special Wednesday.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, the architect of the Queensland University of Technology, said the store filled supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet tissue was hugely bulky so that the amount of supplies was low and, if sold out, it made a lot of empty space on the shelves so that the shortage of stuff was getting worse.
Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if product like toilet tissue and pens can be [bought] and there's a large amount, panic may be minimized, so far Russell Zimmerman through the ABC News Office.
The producer of the recycled toilet tissue Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made tissue Kleinex, and Solaris Paper, which made Sorbent, insists that they work 24/7 to keep the supply, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some property vendors offer a free toilet note to the first auction holder in Melbourne, when less auctions are held because the buyer takes a break for long vacation weekend workers.
The NT News Thursday edition, a diary printed in Darwin, lists eight cover pages that are meant to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
The stores actually refused to apply the limits, according to Australia's ABC report on March 3, they said that they were not planning on applying the purchase limits.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also in high demand, including masks, servings, dry foods, handwashing soap, and flour.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British Ocado supermarket was observed restricting the purchase of Andres toilet tissue until two packs of 12 scrolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 plague—a disease caused by corronavirus SARS-CoV-2—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to how extensive the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemic trip.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and immobilizes its people in response, it takes Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We were very good at the level of preaching and fearlessness and fearsome action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center for Control and Disease Control, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a record published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, there is no respiratory virus that has ever been tracked from its inception to the continuing global spread."
Ghebreyeus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic triggered by coronavirus."
He goes on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic state followed WHO's decision in January that declared this plague as a deterioration of the society that divided the world.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "the point is, this plague will worsen."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported there are at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that continues and is caused by akut heavy breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
An outbreak identified in Wuhan, Tiokok, in December 2019, was reported as a Health Health Health Disease that provided the world on January 30, 2020, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, some 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
The number of fatalities in the case is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breath.
Complications can include tight breathing and pneumonia.
Time from exposure to symptoms in general was about five days, but could range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Preventive action recommended includes washing hands, closing mouths when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and isolation of the individual who is suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by making travel restrictions, quarantine, nighttimes, hazardous workplace control, and facility closures.
The pandemic has caused severe global economic social unrest, delay or cancellation of cultural, political, religious, sports activities, and the extent of the supply of items that are hard to buy panic.
Schools and universities have been closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
Misinformation about this virus has spread online and there is a xenophobic incident and discrimination against the Tionghoa people, people with descendants and appearances of East and Southeast Asia, and people from the area with a significant virus case.
It's a result of heavy travel reductions and industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Tiokok (hubei propensity chief), reported the classer pneumonia with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and the investigation carried out in early January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Sea Sea Seafood market Juanan and therefore the virus is expected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the plague is called SARS-CoV-2, the newly discovered virus and associated with the bat coronavirus, the coronavirus ringing, and the SARS-CoV. The first person with the symptoms later known fell ill on December 1, 2019, and the person does not have a clear connection with the next wet market classer.
Among the first-class cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds of them were found to have a connection to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, at 55 years of age from the province of Hubei, was likely to be the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported dropped in Tiokok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, a new number of cases outside of Tiokok had exceeded the number of new cases in Tiokok for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
Until 26 February, a relatively small number of cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds falling into 2.4% cases worldwide.
Cases refer to the number of people tested by COVID-19 and the results of the tests have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
By 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with light symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, 86% of COVID-19 infection was undetected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was higher than the reported case.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A research published by the United States Disease Control and Prevention Center concludes that the number is likely 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers recovered.
For those who are not cured, time from the development of symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, some 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In China, up to February 5, about 80% of deaths occur in people over 60 years of age and 75% have previously experienced health disorders, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The calculation of official death due to the COVID-19 survey generally refers to those who die giving a positive test for COVID according to the official protocol.
The actual number of fatalities caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, since the official number of people who died untested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
The partial data from Italy found that the excess number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death calculation with a factor of 4-5 times.
A female speaker for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [a number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number," a statement reinforced by a non-profit report on the calculation of the U.S. too low. Too low calculations often appear in the pandemic, such as in the 2009 H1N1 pig flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of Tiokok's land occurred on February 1st in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14th.
Until February 28th, outside the land of China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported death on every continent except Antarctica.
This number varies by region and time, and is influenced by the number of tests, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, type of gender, and overall health. The ratio of death to the case reflects the number of deaths by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate for the case overall is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) by 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the region.
In Tiocurk, the death rate estimate for the case decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms after February 1, 2020).Another estimate includes the number of fatalities in the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed who die from certain diseases, and the number of fatalities in the infection (IFR), which reflect the percentage of those infected (diagnosis and not diagnosed) who die from certain diseases.
This statistic is timeless and following a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for certain populations.
Center for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of fatalities infection for the entire pandemic between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The limit on the scale of this estimate is the result of the first random test for the COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyzes the impact of the CFR test.
WHO confirms that this pandemic can be controlled.
The top and end of this plague is unclear and may be different depending on location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University said, "Without being controlled, a contagious epidemic usually starts and then begins to decline when the disease is running out of the available ants.
However, it's almost impossible to make a sensible projection right now about when it happens."
Senior medical advisor to Tiokkok Zhong Nanshan believes that "this plague may end June" if the whole country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, likely until one or two years."
According to the Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restraint and other steps will be required "so that vaccine is available (probably 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think the possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, can disappear all of it" and this disease may change into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
repeat virulence depends on group immunity and mutation level.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively unspecific and people infected can be without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Poor symptoms include tiredness, the production of respiratoryputum (flogmatic), loss of the sense of smell, breathing, pain of the joints and the muscles, throat pain, headache, choking, vomiting, hemoptissis, diarrhoea, or serasis. WHO states that about one of the six people is severely ill and has difficulty in breathing.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed emergency symptoms including breathing difficulties, depressed chests or chest pain settling, sudden confusion, walking trouble, and blues on the face and lips; medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear. The further development of the disease can be acute pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic sycozectics, and death.
Some infected people may be asymtomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with the results of tests that confirm infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are close to those who are confirmed to be infected should be monitored closely and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tunghoa estimate asymtomatic ratios ranged from a few to 44%.
Incubation periods (when between infections and symptoms) usually range from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, uncertainty, estimated number of COVID-19 patients who lost their initial performance 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Details of how the disease is spreading are still discussed.
The COVID-19 preaching is believed primarily to occur at close contact and through small droplet produced when coughing, sweating, or talking; close contact is between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 ft).
Research found that unplugged cough can cause droplets to be pushed 4.5 meters (15 feet) up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that viruses may also be transmitted by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced while talking. Breath droplet can also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although this virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplet can fall in the mouth or the nose of someone close to it or it may fall into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung heart (RJP), can cause a respiratory secret to turn into aerosols and spread through the air.
Preaching can also happen when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through a phase, this risk is believed to be low.
The Government of Tiokok may be dreaming of a fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission.The most contagious virus in the first three days after the event, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and at the stages of further disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before symptoms, which signal transmissions may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few asymtomatic case reports are confirmed by the laboratory, but asymtomatic transmission has been identified by some countries while investigating the search of contact.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others.
Specifically, found that viruses can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylen) and 304-cart steel, one day on the card, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on the moisture and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that might have been affected by the infected.
Koronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, the first time isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with the classer case acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All of the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are newly associated with the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if it has a household soap, which enqueues its protective envelope.
The virus is estimated to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that coronavirus is genetically classed with the genus Beacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (or perhaps B-seed) along with two galloned bats.
This virus has 96% in the entire genome with other batCov RaTG13 corronavirus samples.
In February 2020, researchers Tionghoa found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the secondary genome between the bloodthirsty virus and the human virus.
Until now, the comparison of the entire genome has found the most 92% of the genetic matter between coronavirus scouring and SARS-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that the grinding is an intermediate angel SARS-CoV-2.
Virus infection may be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, but confirmation in the end is made by the reaction of reverse polymerase transcription chain (rRT-PCR) on infected secretes or through CT imaging.
A study that compares between PCR and CT in Wuhan shows that CT significantly is more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with the many distancing features that overlap with pneumonia and other disease processes.
By March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, first released on January 17.
Test using real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on a blood sample.
The results are generally available within hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed on the nasopharynx, but it can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, not one of these serological tests proved to be accurate enough to approve its use.
In the U.S., the serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by the verified laboratory.
The characteristics of computed radiography and tomography (CT) features in people who are symptomatic include the ground glass asymmetry and there is no pleura efusi.
The Italian Radiological Society is building the international database for a demonstration finding on confirmed cases.
Because the passenger is dwindling with other infections such as adenovirus, an unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A major study in Tiokok compares chest CT results with PCR and shows that although less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive that it is recommended to be considered as a screening tool in the epidemic area.
Convolutional neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed to detect the features of the imaging of the virus with radiographs and CT.
Strategy to prevent the spread of this disease includes keeping good personal hygiene comprehensively, washing hands, avoiding eye, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing tissue while coughing or sneezing and immediately throwing the tissue into a trash can.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical restraints are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various regions have restricted or resorted to halting all non-essential journeys to and from countries and regions affected by the plague.
However, the virus has reached the scale of the spread of society in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread to the society, and some members of the society do not know where or how they are infected.
The use of the location data from the government's cell phone for this purpose has triggered a matter of privacy, with a statement from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for this kind of surveillance limitation.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed to be used voluntarily, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts are working on a friendly privacy solution, such as using Bluetooth to record the user's distance to another phone.
Next, the user will receive a message if they're close to someone who's tested positive for COVID-19.Leave a misunderstanding about how to prevent infection; for example, brushing nose and chewing with an ineffective chewing drug.
There's not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing hands is encouraged to prevent disease from spreading.
The CDC recommends that people often wash hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after toilets or when hands look dirty; before eating; and after spreading noses, coughs, or sinews.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, viruses were killed by a home soap that damaged the protective layer.
In addition, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand service with a low alcohol content of at least 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages a person not to touch his eyes, nose, or mouth before washing his hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of larynxes (in one minute disinfected to the low surface of the karate), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorit 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other streams, such as chlorida benzalkonium and chlorhexidine glukonate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed COVID cases in the public facility, such as office or childcare facility, all areas such as office, bathroom, public area, electronic equipment together such as tablet, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machine used by the sufferer, should be disinfected.
The health organization recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with whipped elbows or use tissue when coughing or sneezing, and immediately remove tissue.
The surgical mask recommended for people who may have been infected because using masks can limit volume and length of breathable droplet spreads when speaking, sweating, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on time and manner of masking.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using masks can reduce people's tendency to touch face with insufficiently clean hands, which are the main sources of transmission."Maskers also recommended to use by people who care for others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of a healthy person's masks only if they are at high risk, such as the person who treats the COVID-19 sufferer, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing a mask can help prevent people from touching their face.
Some countries have begun to promote the use of masks to members of society.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medicine masks made of cloth. Tiochik specifically recommends the use of medical masks once used to a healthy society, especially when close to 1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks when using public transportation or living in crowded areas.
Thai health officials encourage people to make clothes masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned the public from going out to the public without wearing a mask or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear a mask when they went to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government forced everyone who entered the serene to wear a mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear masks when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since the mid-March, requires train and interstate bus passengers to wear face masks for April 1st.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time outside the house, and recommends the creation of artificial face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social exclusion (also referred to as physical restraint) is an infection control action designed to slow the spread of disease by minimizing contact between individuals.
Social limitation methods include quarantine; road arrest; and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Social harassment can be applied by living at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using uncontacted greeting, and keeping the physical distance from others.
At present, many governments are obliged to seek social restraint in areas affected by the plague.
The maximum number of people recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organization quickly decreased, starting from 250 people (if unknown as far as COVID-19 is concerned) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. The aged and those with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and the troubled immune system that were at risk of serious illness and higher complications, suggest the CDC for as much as possible at home as possible in areas that were affected at the level of society. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social exclusion" as "physical limitation", to clarify that its aim is to reduce physical contact with maintaining social relations, either in virtual or from a distance.
The use of the term "social exclusion" implies that people have to isolate themselves completely socially and do not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative ways.
This recommendation includes the encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or virus symptoms.
Private isolation in the home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and suspected infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many governments are obliged or recommending independent quarantines for all populations living in affected areas.
The strictest quarantine instruction is issued for people of high risk groups.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to the country or region with extensive COVID-19 coverage are advised to do independent quarantine for 14 days since the last possible date.
The strategy in the control of the plague is control or suppression, and mitigation.
Convergence is done at the early stage of the outbreak and is intended to track and isolate infected people and take other steps to control infection and vaccinations that aim to stop disease spread to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the disease, the next effort turns to the mitigation stage: these steps are taken to slow down the preaching and reduce its impact on the health and society care system.
Combination of retention and mitigation actions can be done at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1.The amount of the management of infectious diseases is trying to lower the top of the epidemic, which is known to trigger an epidemic curve.
It lowers the risk of anaesthetics in health services and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical intervention to deal with the epidemic includes individual precautions, such as hand-cleaning, wearing face masks, and independent quarantine; steps at the level of society that is intended for physical limitation, such as closing the school and cancelling the mass gathering; community placements to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and steps at the level of the environment, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries also apply various steps aimed at restricting the spread of viruses.
South Korea introduces local mass and quarantine, and warns about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who do independent quarantine and wear huge fines for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of facial masks and punishes medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (drinking, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have great challenges.
Optimum mitigation policy can reduce the peak of demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but it still results in hundreds of thousands of deaths and a hostile health system.
A suppression may be selected, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to dissipate in the human population (or until vaccines are available, if this is the first reached), because otherwise, the transmission will fly back quickly when the suppression steps are delayed.
Long-term intervention to press the pandemic has an impact on social and economics.
There is no specific antivirus drug approved for COVID-19, but the development efforts are being made, which includes an existing drug test.
Absorbing free flu drugs, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depends on the level of depravity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can make the patient's condition worse.
Some of the animals previously approved for treatment of another virus disease are being tested for use in treating COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and household manipulation" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting health services for the needs of patients with COVID-19 is a basic step in responding to the disease.
ECDC and the European Regional WHO Office has issued guidelines for hospital and primary health services to divert resources from various levels, including focussing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible to cancel elective procedures, separate and isolate positive patients COVID-19, and increase intensive care capacity by personal training and increase fan numbers and bed.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known new coronavirus case can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiokok.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei rose gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Grand Market of Huanan Sea Food, which also sells animals alive, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Whah Center hospital told their colleagues about "coronavirus similar to SARS."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false fates, and the others, Ai Fen, were reproved by his superiors for the warning he had issued.
The Whah City Health Commission announced to the public on December 31 and told WHO.
Sufficiently many unrecognised cases of pneumonia are reported to the health authority in Wuhan that then triggered the investigation in early January. At the beginning of the plague, the number of cases increased twice every seven and a half days.
In the early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of Tiokok, supported by migration during the New Year Imlek and because Wuhan was the transport center and transit point of the main train.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.For 26 March, the United States has surpassed the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. By April 9, 2020, over 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 people have died in the world and over 364,000 were cured.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Because of a pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area limit free movement and make border controls.
National responses include measures of resistance, such as quarantine (dependence as housing orders, shelter orders, or quarantines) and evenings.

On March 14, 2020, President Iran Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and said that his country was having difficulty fighting the plague because of the lack of access to the international market as a result of the US sanctions against Iran. This plague has prompted the United States to adopt general social policies in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher education levels for the health of the community.
Political analysts predicting this may have a negative impact on Donald Trump's opportunity to be re-elected in President 2020's election. Diplomatic links between Japan and South Korea have worsened because of this pandemic.
South Korea criticizes "ambigu and passive Japanese quarantine" after Japan announces that everyone who comes from South Korea will be placed in quarantine for two weeks at a government location.
At first, the view of the South Koreans was shared by President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many Koreans sign a petition, or call upon Moon's proclamations, on the basis of their claims about the government's misdeeds in dealing with the plague, or commend their response.
Some commentators expressed concern that it would enable the government to strengthen its influence on power.
In Hungary, his parliament chose to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule through timeless decrees, to postpone parliament and public elections, and to punish those who are considered to be spreading false information about viruses and crisis management by the government.
Coronavirus plague was studied in cases of lack of supply, which came from an increase in the use of equipment globally to fight the plague, panic purchase, and operating disturbances of factories and logistics.
The U.S. Drug and Food Supervisor is warning about a lack of medicine and medical equipment because of an increased demand for consumers and food disorders.
Some areas have also been traded because of panic that causes the loss of the basic needs of trees, such as food, toilets, and bottled water, which trigger a lack of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about delays in sending electronics.
According to general director of WHO Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self-protection equipment is 100 times higher.
This request resulted in a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and triggered a four - to - six - month postponement of medical supplies.
It also causes a lack of protective tools around the world, and WHO warns that it will endanger health.
In Australia, the pandemic offered new opportunities for retailers to sell Australia’s products in Tiokok.
This activity resulted in a milk shortage of formulas in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Out of the height of the prevalence of the COVID-19 case in North Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, these two areas were avoided by lack of food supplies.
The steps of Tiokok and Italy to combat the development and illegal trade of important products were successful so that a lack of accurate food anticipated in Europe and North America could be avoided.
North Italy, with its large agricultural productions, has not yet experienced declines, but prices can increase according to industry representation.
Empty food stores are only temporarily discovered, even in the city of Wuhan, as the government official of Tiokok took off pig meat reserves to ensure the community's nutrition.
Similar communities also exist in Italy, which requires food producers to keep reserves for such emergency conditions.
Global economic decline has been felt in China: According to the media report on March 16, the economy in Tiokok was hit in the first two months of 2020 as a result of the steps the government took to curb the spread of viruses, and the sale of anjlok ritels of 20.5%.
Since Tiokkokland is a major economic center and manufacturing, the virus epidemic is considered to pose a major threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the market will remain in motion until there is a clearer picture of the potential for the end result.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of the global epidemic on global growth could surpass the SARS plague in 2002-2004.
An estimate from a Washington University expert in St. Louis stated that the plague has affected more than $300 billion in the supply chain of the world, which can last for two years.
The Earth Mining Exports Organization (OPEC) reported "kuchar-chire" after the price of earth oil has dropped sharply as a result of a decrease in the demand from Tiokok.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside the land of China.
On February 27th, due to increased concerns about the coronavirus plague, various U.S. stock indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 indexes, and Dow Jones Industrial Avage, recorded a drop of 1,191 points, with Dow falling one of the biggest days since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
The three stock indexes close the week with a reduction of more than 10%.
On 28 February, the Scope Ratings GmbH ruled the Tiokkok government credit rating, but maintained a negative Outlook.
Anecdotes again because of the fear of coronavirus, the biggest decline occurred on March 16th.
A lot of people think economic recession might happen.
Econom Mohamed El-Erian praised the urgent steps of central bank and timely state.
The central bank reacted faster than they did at the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors because of travel bans, public closures, including tourist sites, and government actions that limit travel around the world.
As a result, many drivers canceled flights because of the slightest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British Flybe regional drivers collapsed.
It's found in the travel industry at a level that's never seen before.
A number of railway and ferry stations have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season related to New Year's Imlek.
A number of events involving many people were canceled by the central government and the area, including the New Year's Imlek festivals, and the private company also automatically shut down shops and tourist sites, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many of the New Year’s events Imlek and the holiday home are closed to prevent mass meetings, including the forbidden city of Beijing and the traditional temple exhibition.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, the city ofmadya, and the region of Tiokok, the authorities extended the New Year to February 10 and ordered most of the jobs not to be reopened to that date.
These areas are 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of the exports.
Hong Kong increases the removal of infectious diseases to the highest level and announces the emergency situation, closes the school until March, and cancels the New Year's celebration.
Visits to European and Latin America's captors fell by 40%.
The North and Central American researchers suffered a 50–60% decline.
It also resulted in 33-43% of pedestrian traffic falling to the shopping center in March compared to February.
The global costing operator is doing additional steps, such as an increase in sanitation, the installation of the most expensive exams, and the cancellation of the event, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the recession can cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people in comparison with the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during Wuhan’s peak epidemic, some 5 million people in Tiokok lost their jobs.
Most of the 300 million Chinese rural workers were homeless in a remote province or trapped in the province of Hubei. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a koronavirus plague could cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the level of employment can reach 32%. The region in India has caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily pay). Surveys from Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households had some kind of job loss. Almost 900,000 workers had lost their jobs in Spain since it was done forty-five regions in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, four million French workers applied for temporary employment and 1 million British workers offered a universal credit scheme, and nearly half a million companies in Germany submitted a short-term employment scheme for the government, known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Worldwide, the art industry of performance and cultural heritage is heavily impacted by the pandemic, which affects the operation of the organization and individuals, both employed and self-employed.
The art and culture sector organization strives to uphold their high mission (often public-funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the public, to ensure the safety of employees and society, and to support the arts if possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, shows, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with shows, shows, shows, and shows canceled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. This is damaging to other diseases that are new and very rapidly developed are the cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and costume shows.
The film industry was also disturbed, and the Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebration in Rome, which fell on the last week of Christian repentance, was canceled.
Many communities encourage Christian seniors to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services through radio, live newspapers or television, while others offer the worship of drive-in or awakening.
By closing the church and chapels of the Roman Catholic Kescupan and barring it from the Holy Peters of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public meetings in the church, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurders.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayer in areas covered with plague and places of worship and then closed, while Saudi Arabia forbids the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the sacred places of Mecca and Medina.
Since World War II, this pandemic has caused the most significant disruption of the world sports calendar.
Most major sports events are cancelled or postponed, including the League of UEFA Champions 2019-2020, the League of Premier 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-2020, and the NHL 2019-2020.
This plague is messing up the 2020 Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but not more than the summer of 2021."All over the world, casinos and other games are closed and the direct broadcast of poker tournaments is delayed or cancelled.
This has caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites have reported significant new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with music groups delaying or canceling the concert tour.
Many large theaters like Broadway also delay all the performances.
Artists explore various ways to continue to produce and share works through the Internet as an alternative to a direct traditional show, such as a live online concert or make web-based "festival" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their works.
Many use the Internet for coronaurus to spread its message with many people who turn to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 plague, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the people of Tunghoa and East Asia, as well as against people from affected areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion, and widespread hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia-Pacific.
The report of February (when most cases are still limited in Tiokok) notes the racist sentiment revealed in various groups around the world that the Tionghoa people deserve to accept viruses or receive what they claim as a fair reward.
Some countries in Africa are also experiencing an increase in anti-Thiong sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei report discrimination because of their background.
There's been support for the Tionghoa people, both online and offline, and for people in areas with viruses.
The development of outbreaks to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe with a serious COVID-19 disease, could also be a target of suspicion and xenophobia. People in the countries included Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition prohibiting the Tunghoa from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become a Twitter train.
The Tionghoa and other Asians in Britain Raya and the United States reported an increase in the level of racial harassment and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling coronavirus "Virus Tiokok", a term that critics considered to be racist and anti-Tiok.
Fountains in Ukraine attacked buses that brought Ukrainians and aliens evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East India, bordered with Tiokok, and learning in large Indian cities reported having been subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus plague.
The President of the Bharatiya Janata Party State Unit in West Begligaa Dilip Ghosh states that Tiokkok has destroyed nature and "that is why God takes vengeance on them."
That statement was then threatened by a Turkish consulate in Kolkata, calling it a "misleader" in China, xenophobics and racism against non-Thionghoa's inhabitants are reported by the pandemic, with strangers described as "foreign waste" and targeted for "recovery".
Many of the newspapers who use paid talks have deleted them for some or all of their coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers make the most associated outbreak science available with open access.
Some scientists choose to distribute results quickly on a printer server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes a method that detects the existence of the virus and detects the antibodies produced as a response to infection.
There is a virus in the sample confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA as a single.
This test is used to confirm a new infection or is still active.
Antibodies detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibodies tests show the number of people who have been infected, including those who are usually too light to report or without symptoms.
The number of mortalitys that are accurate and the level of group immunity in the population can be determined by the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, by March 2020, no country had any background data on virus prevalence in its population.
By 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests that have been carried out in the countries.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of fatalities reported, which is likely to be too high in some countries.
Using the reaction of the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on the respiratory sample obtained by various methods, including nasopharynx orputum sample.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed on a throat valve can only be trusted during the first week of illness.
Later, the virus could disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for the infected person tested on the second week, sample material can be taken from the inhalation channel by using the isap or material emitted through the sputum.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the reaction of the real-time reverse polymerase transcription chain (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
English Raya also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korea company Kogenebiotech developed a CRP-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerCheck Coronavirus) pre-testing device, which was based on a clinical clinic on 28 January 2020.
This device is looking for an "E" gene that has all beta coronavirus, and a specific RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2. In T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T., BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from T-T-T-T-N-T-T-T-T-N-T-T-T-T-N-T-T-T-T-N-R-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-R-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-R-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-R-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-S-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-S-D-D-D-S-S-S-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-S-D-S-S-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-S-D-D-D-S-D-S-D-S-D-D-S-S-S-D-D-D-D-D-S-D-S-D-S-S-S-S-D-S-S-S-S-S-S-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-S-D-D-S-D-S-S-S-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-S-D-S-D-D-D-S-D-S-D-D-D-D-D-S-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-S-D-D-S-D-S-S-D-S-S-D-S-S-D-S-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-S-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-D-S-S-D-S-D-D-S-S-S-D-R-R-D-R-S-S-S
One out of three genetic tests on old version tests yielded unconvinced results due to reactive errors, and the number of CDC tests limited in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being processed throughout February 2020.
Trial using two components considered untrustworthy until February 28, 2020, and after that the state laboratory and the local laboratory were allowed to perform tests.
This test was approved by the United States Drug Supervisory and Food Authority based on the Authority of Emergency Use. The U.S. Commercial Laboratory began testing at the beginning of March 2020.
By March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of the COVID-19 testing based on the RT-PCR on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics produced a national national COVID-19 test on March 9, 2020.
No recommended quantity limits; collection and processing of specimens must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the Federal Surveillance Service registered the tests in Health Care. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic reported developing tests to detect COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that could be carried out within 3.5 hours with high volume so that a machine could perform approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, FDA authorized the use of emergency (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing in the m2000 Abbott system; FDA had previously issued the same authorisation to Holic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the U.S. from the FDA for a 45-minute trial.
FDA has approved testing using isothermal acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Because there is no need for a series of changes in the temperature cycle, this method can yield positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott anticipate to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monochlonal antibodies that specifically link new nucleopacid proteins (N proteins) are being developed in Taiwan, hoping to yield results within 15 to 20 minutes as rapid influenza tests.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "photothoracs have a small diagnostic value at the early stage, as well as the CT [compared tomography] findings may already exist before the onset of symptoms."
Special features on CT include bilateral wide-glass multi-bar opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior.
Subpleura dominating, crazy showing, and consolidasis formed as a result of disease development.
In Wuhan, a study that compares PCR with CT at the current pandemic point shows that CT significantly is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many pneumonia and other disease processes.
By March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."On March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the identification of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals from about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population monitoring. The check can be done at the central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care (PoCT).
The automatic system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this examination, but its availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, a peripheral blood specimen is generally used, although a series of specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, it is generally used as one specimen of the peripheral blood that was obtained through a skin stitch.
Unlike the PCR method, the extraction step was not required prior to the examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 organizations that provided notification to the agency as needed and because it could now distribute their antibodies tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test approved by the FDA based on authorisation of emergency use. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their testing devices that could detect IgG and IgA antibodies to viruses in blood samples.
The test capacity up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR checks on RNA viruses.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after the outbreak of infection. In early April, Raya found that none of the antibodies that were purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong developed a scheme to allow the expected patient to stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient an inspection tube," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results a few moments later. The British NHS announces that NHS is pioneering the suspected case review scheme at home so as to eliminate the risk of the patient shooting others if they come to the hospital or must disinfect ambulances if they are used. At the stage examination for the suspected case of COVID-19, a professional health force will take samples using appropriate precautions.
On 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Germany said that Germany had about 12,000 tests per day in road traffic and 10,700 tests had been conducted the week before.
Costs are borne by health insurance if a doctor asks for a test.
According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a wake - up test was offered in a number of large cities.
By 26 March 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested up to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technical and Rambam Hospital develop and test methods to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only further testing if a couple sample was found positive. In Wuhan, a emergency laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin language: , or "Api Mata" in Indonesian language) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction monitored by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the modernization showed that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the cost related to Karantina management could be twice as high if this test capacity did not exist.
Wuhan laboratory soon followed by the Huo-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in all of China.
By March 4, 2020, the total capacity of the day is 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design issued by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 checks. This balanced design can be carried out in a small laboratory without needing a robotic fluid.
By the month of March, lack and lack of sufficient reagents have been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, in Britain, and in the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers are trying to explore sample testing protocols involving sample warming at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, the United Arab Emirates reported doing more coronavirus tests by population capitas than any country, and are ready to increase the scale of testing to most populations.
This is achieved through combination of state-of-the-art testing and mass production of the laboratory of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on the laboratory of emergency detection "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory is capable of tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of China.
A variety of testing recipes that target various sections of coronavirus genetic profiles are developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German prescription for the production of testing devices sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop itself.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Center was not available until January 28th, so that it slowed down the testing available in the United States. In the beginning of the plague, Tiokok and the United States are having problems with the occurrence of the test device; these two countries and Australia are unable to provide sufficient testing tools to meet requests and recommendations for medical examinations.
On the contrary, experts say that extensive testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The ability to test, mostly in the private sector laboratory, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization identified an increase in the testing program as the best way to slow down the increase of the COVID-19 pandemic. High requirements for testing due to the widespread spread of viruses cause hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for testing in the U.S. private laboratory, and the supplies of the wetlands and chemical reactors to become gesturing.
By March 2020, China reported the problem of accuracy on their test devices.
In the United States, a test device developed by the CDC has a "disruption"; the government then removes the obstacle of bureaucracy that prevents private testing. Spain buys the test device from the company Tiongz Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but finds that the result is not accurate.
The company explained that failure to collect samples or to use them properly might result in a failure.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would attract the wrong-doing equipment, and replace it with another test device provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the tests purchased by the Czech Republic of Tioko in Tiochikk, and Slovakia bought 1.2 million tests from Tiokok.
Prime Minister Matovič recommended that this test device be thrown into the Danube River. Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said that the test device that was bought in Turkey from Turkey had a "high level of error" and they didn't "use it". British Raya bought 3.5 million tests from Turkey, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test device could not be used.
Tests, followed by forty positive people and tracking people with positive individuals SARS-CoV-2, yield positive results.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, the first location of death due to COVID-19 in Italy, did two rounds of testing on the entire population of 3,400 people, about 10 days.
About half of the positive tested people have no symptoms, and all cases found in quarantine.
With restrictions on travel to this community, new infections are completely eliminated.
With aggressive contacts, forced entry, testing, and quarantine restrictions, the coronavirus 2020 pandemic in Singapore grows much slower than other developed countries, even without extreme restrictions, such as closing the restaurant and the ritual company.
Many of the events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that the people stay at home on March 28, but the schools were reopened on March 23rd.
Some other countries also handle pandemics with aggressive contacts, forced entry, testing, and quarantine restrictions, but with quarantine areas that are not too aggressive, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower number of fatalities, perhaps because these countries were better able to detect people with mild or unexplained symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive samples COVID-19 and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 are in North America, and 1 is in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "positive results of testing" was influenced by the country's policy of testing.
The country that only tests people in hospital will have % higher positive results than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with the same factors.
Washing hands, which is also called hand-washing, is the act of cleaning a person’s hands that aims to remove dirt, oil, microorganism, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently in certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, transmitted through a fecal-oral route.
People may also experience respiratory disease, such as influenza or disease, if they do not wash hands before touching eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucosa membrane).
Five days of a critical day that is very important to wash hands with soap is: before and after a great shower, after cleaning a child's ass or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or cooking meat, fish, or raw mushrooms.
If water and soap do not exist, hands can be cleaned with ashes.
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning kids who just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hygiene relates to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving a medicine or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse hands from pathogens (bacterial, virus, or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for the public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses, and other infectious diseases; preventing contagious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infection;
and reducing infant mortality at home.
The study carried out in 2013 showed that a slight increase in handwashing practice may increase the growth of offspring.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children due to respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as by washing hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate due to the disease to almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce the diarrhea to about one third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of diare case reductions can be associated with soap washing. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and infection of acute breathing channels (ISPA), as a low-level behavior done at home, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of the number one death of children; it causes the death of some 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using toilets can be used to save more lives than vaccines or any medical action, and reducing death from diarrhea to almost half and death from acute respiratory tract infection to quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitary actions as part of the water program, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).
Washing hands also protects itself from the empetigo that is transmitted through physical contact directly.
The minor side effects of washing hands are handwashing that can often cause skin damage due to skin discharges.
Studies carried out in Denmark in 2012 found that overwashing can cause the skin of the ankle and the joint, which is known to be the exact hand or dermatitis of the hand, which is particularly common among health workers.
Washing hands too often is seen as one of the obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments all day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the spread of fecal-oral disease: before and after use of toilets, after cleaning children's buttocks, before feeding children, before eating and before preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or raw ointment.
Another important time to apply the technique of washing hands is to prevent disease from spreading is before and after taking care of the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal dirt or handling animals; and after touching the trash.
In many countries, the level of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study on washing hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that average 38.7% of households practice soap washing. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest level of 97 percent; the United States had nearly 77 percent in the middle; and China at the lowest level with 23 percent. Some methods of changing behavior are now available to improve the adoption of behaviors washing hands with soap at a critical time. Washing hands group for students at a specified time is one of the choices in developing countries to habitually wash hands in child behavior.
The Basic Health Care Program that the Education Department applies in the Philippines is an example of a balanced action to support health and education for children.
Twice a year, plus washing hands each day with soap and brushing teeth every day with fluoroids, is the core of this national program.
The program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Microorganism cleansing of the skin is reinforced by adding soap or detergent to water.
The main work of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to the oceans and improve the speed of traffic.
Water is an efficient skin cleaner because of fat and protein, which is a component of organic waste, is not easily laminated in water.
Nevertheless, the flow of sufficient water helps to clean fat and protein.
Heavy soap, because of its potential to use, may contain bacteria that were obtained from previous uses.
A small number of studies that investigate the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap conclude that transfer cannot occur because of bacteria that are infected with foam.
Even so, the CDC continues to say, "the liquid garden that is being spent from the container without being touched by a better hand."
The fire soap is greatly encouraged by a healthy society.
Until now, there has been no evidence that antiseptic use or disinfection is better recommended for organisms that hold antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains general anti-war agents such as triklosan, which have a list of ancient, long - held organisms.
So, even though an antibiotic-resistant strain is not targeted by the antibacterial soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective substances, advanced formulations may contain acidic acid (asam asetat, assam ascorbat, asam laktat) as a pH, benzoate as an antimicrobial active acid, and further skin conditioner (oil, vitamins, mentols, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon's Medical Faculty of Health showed that soap is as effective as usual with the consumer-level antibacterium soap that contains triclauses in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from the hands.
Comfortable hot water to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster on body temperature (37 °C).
The warm water is more effective than the cold water is in eliminating natural oil that holds soil and bacteria.
Yet, going back with the belief of many, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand care or antiseptics are non-water-based sanitation agents.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the hand-cleaning agents were non-water-based alcoholics (also referred to as alcoholic-based hand-washers, antiseptics, or hand-services) becoming known.
Most of these cleaning agents are alcohol or ethanol isopropyl-based, which are processed together with reconstituted substances such as Carbonmer (acrylic acid polymers) into gels or wets such as glycerin into liquids or shells to be easy to use and to reduce the dry effect of alcohol.
Increased hydrogen peroxide nitrogen increases further antimicrobial activity. Hand care containing at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient chemical killer.
Violated alcohol treatment kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis), and mushrooms.
Alcohol treatment containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log 3.5 decrease, similar to 35 decibels) bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands 1 minute after use. Most effective hand care against bacteria and not effective against some viruses.
Hand-services based on alcohol are almost entirely not effective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis. Hand-based antiseptics or alcoholics in sufficient quantities should be used to immerse themselves or cover two hands completely.
The front and back of both hands and in the wind and end of all fingers was rubbed about 30 seconds to liquid, foam, or dry gel.
The fingertips should also be washed well by rubbing them in two arms, especially when the hands look dirty.
Improving the use of service agencies because of the ease of use and the rapid killing activity of micro-organisms; however, the service agencies should not be used as a replacement for proper handwashing, except soap and water not available.
The use of alcohol-based handholds can often cause dry skin, except if hemolian and/or skin-removals are added to the formula.
Dry effects from alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other hemolynic to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol - based treatment of the hands containing hemoli causes irritation and skin dryness much lower than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
Dermatitis allergic contact, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive substance in the chewing of alcohol rarely occur.
The lower incidence causes the dermatitis of contact that interferes into the pull of this product compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't clean their hands from organic materials, but just disinfect them.
For this reason, the hands cleaner is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still in the hands.
The commitment of free-hand alcohol is highly dependent on the materials and formulations, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol abusers.
Recently, the formulation that uses chlorida benzalkonium has proven to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, not like alcohol, which is proven to be less after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects.
Many people in low - income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microorganism, soil or ash may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if contact with water, ashes will form an alkalie line.
WHO recommends as alternative soap when soap is not available.
The technique washes the right hands based on the recommended U.S. Disease Control Center for prevention of disease transmission includes the following steps:
A handy basahi with flowing hot or cold water.
The water flows as recommended as a result of a steady balcomum that may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to be unaffected.
Put your hand through it with a lot of soap, including your back, on your fingers, and under your nails.
The soap lifts palms out of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Gosok for at least 20 seconds.
Chewing creates a tremor, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rub longer to remove more germs.
Review thoroughly below the water flowing.
Collecting in the balkom can cause the hands to get contaminated again.
Dry with a dry lap or let it dry in the air.
Wet hands and moisture are easier to recontaminate. The area that is often passed by is a thumb, wrist, area between fingers, and under nails.
The artificial nail and the discolored fingernails can store microorganism.
Mortgage lotions are often recommended to keep hands dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand-washing when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, flowing water from the water that hangs and/or coils and/or use ash, if necessary, in the developing country. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as school or rural areas in developing countries), there is a water hemat solution, such as "typ-tap", and other low-cost options.
The tippy peas is a simple technology that uses a water bottle that hangs with ropes, the veos that are operated by the feet to pour a little water into the hands, and a soap.
Effective handshake is an important part of the hand-cleaning process, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand-drive in the public toilet.
The more research shows that paper laps are much cleaner than the electric dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper industry, to compare the level of paper cleaning, warmer air dryer, and more moderate jet air control.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% in the fingers books and 254% in the palms.
Thrilled with jet air dryers caused a total increase of 42% in the total number of bacteria in the fingers books and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying by paper, the total number of bacteria decreases by an average of 76% in the textbooks and 77% in the palms.The scientist also performs tests to determine potential cross contamination in the other toilet users and the toilet environment due to each type of drying methods.
The jet air dryer, which sprays the air from the unit at a speed claimed 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and units and capable of infecting other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters.
The use of warm air dryers spread microorganisms up to 0,25 meters from the dryers.
Paper Lap did not show significant microorganism distribution. In 2005, in a study by TÜV Product und Umwelt, various methods of handing were evaluated.
After handing out, changes to the following number of bacteria are observed:
There are many hand dryers, and the hand dryers have been compared to the drying using paper.
Washing hands using hand-held tissue is alternative for traveling without soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand care must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical washing was required far after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found his effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There's an electronic device that provides feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the level of infection decreased with the use of the device.
Medical washing was done for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in a large number of or gels to soften and rub each part of the hand.
Hands must be rubbed together with one another's fingers tied together.
If there's dirt under the nails, the fur belt can be used to remove it.
Since the palms can survive in the water in their hands, the hand needs to be rinsed thoroughly and dried with a clean lip.
After drying, the paper is used to shut down the water tap (and open the door if necessary).
This action avoids hand-recontamination from the surface.
The goal of washing hands in health care is to remove pathogen microorganisms ("skuman") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that insufficiently washes hands still on levels that are unacceptable in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forget to wash hands before touching patients so that microorganism is transmitted.
One study shows that washing the right hand and other simple procedures can lower the rate of infection of the blood flow related to a catheter to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing standard washing hands and shaking hands in the health care sector.
The WHO concept of hand-cleaning can also be seen on its website for public comment.
A relevant review by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if compliance with rules is demonstrated.
The World Health Organization has five moments to wash hands:
after being exposed to blood/body fluid
Before the aseptic task, and
After the patient's treatment, an addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap or antimicrobial soap works to kill handwashing.
The kill function may be desired before surgery or in a situation when an antibiotic-resistant organism is very common. To 'scoring' the hands before surgery, it is necessary to treat the skin that can be lit and turned off without touching, chlorohexidin or iodium washing, a sterile lap to dry hands after washing, and a sterile tie to rub and other sterile tools to clean under nails.
All jewels have to be released.
This procedure requires washing hands and arms down to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not required.
When collecting, the water in the lower arms should be prevented from turning back into the hands.
After finishing washing, hands are rinsed with sterile cloth and scalpel.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use hand care before and after dealing with the sick.
For the control of staphylococcus infection in the hospital, it was found that the biggest benefit of hand-washing came from the first 20% washing, and that the additional benefit obtained was very little when the frequency of hand-washing was increased above 35%.
Washing with soap usually causes more than three times the transmission of infection to food than washing with anti-bacterial soap. The comparison between rubbing hands with alcohol-based larynx and washing hands with anti-bacterial soap with each median time of 30 seconds shows that the shaker is based on alcohol reduces the contamination of the bacteria 26% more than the anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handwashers to reduce the A H1N1 influenza virus and the Clostridium spores difficult from hands. Intervention to improve the hygiene of the health care can involve education for staff about hand-washing, increase the availability of alcoholic-based handshake, and write-on reminders to the staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various health care settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic cost-effective way of achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand washing facilities in the homes of residents, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universally washed behavior.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, handwashing is rare in close proximity to private toilets or public toilets, even though options are available to make a cheap handwashing place.
In any case, the low level of handwashing can also be due to a pattern that has been planted and not to a lack of soap or water.
The desire and encouragement to wash hands with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and bring about changes in long-term population behavior.
In order to walk effectively, surveillance and evaluation is required.
Systematic review of 70 studies found that an effective community-based approach to raising hand washing at the LMIC, while the social marketing campaign was not effective. One example of hand washing at school was UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" which pushed the school to take simple and cheap steps to ensure students wash hands with soap, among other conditions of cleanliness.
When the minimum standards are achieved, the school can move from one star to the last three stars.
Building handwashing can be a part of a handwashing campaign that is designed to reduce childhood disease and death.
The Day Washing the World's Hands is another example of awareness-raising campaign that attempts to achieve the purpose of changing behavior. Through the 2019-2020 Korean virus pandemic, UNICEF encourages hand-washing emoji.
Some studies investigate cost-effectively washing hands in all countries have developed in connection with disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) avoidance or loss of age.
One survey showed that encouraging soap-washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for the vulnerable, such as a mother who had just given birth or an injured soldier in a hospital, first known in the mid-19th century by two hand-cleaning reports: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "modern care workers" in England.
At that time, many people still believe that infection is caused by the foul smell of miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, a plague transmitted through food and infections related to health care made the United States Disease Control and Prevention Center more active stimulates hand-cleaning as an important way to prevent infection.
Pig flu epidemics in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raise awareness in many countries will be of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from the infectious disease.
For example, the poster "technically washes the right hand" was hung on the sinks of hand washing in the public toilet as well as on the toilets of the office and airport in Germany.
The word "washing hands from" means saying someone's reluctance to take responsibility for something or get involved in something.
It came from the Bible chapter of Matthew’s book when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to release Jesus Christ, but it had been widely used in the English community.
In Shakespeare’s work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, began to wash her hands constantly to cleanse the imaginary stains; acts that show her guilt for the crime she did and because she had persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that when people remember or meditate on unethical actions, they tend to wash their hands more often and they tend to appreciate the equipment to wash their hands.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation have smaller potentials involved in "cleaning" compensation, such as volunteering.
Religion commands the washing of hands for the purpose of cleanliness and symbolism. The washing of symbolic hands, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is the ritual of washing hands in many religions, including the Bahá'í, Hindu, the Jews, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hindu religion, Jews, and Islam were obliged to wash hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindu religion, Buddhas, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims were obliged to wash their hands before and after eating.
Hazard control for COVID-19
Hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of safety and occupational health methodologies for the control of hazards for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper risk control at the workplace depends on the location of work and work, based on the assessment of the risk of exposure, the level of disease in society, and the risk of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, work at low risk has minimal contact with the public and other work partners; for this work, it is encouraged basic infection prevention steps, which include hand-washing, prompting workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics, and doing cleaning and disinfection of the work environment routinely.
Occupations at risk include jobs that require close contact or often with people who are not known or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected by the transmission of the society that is going on or on an international journey.
This group includes workers who have contact with public communities, such as at school, the working environment with high population density, and high volume rites.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high efficiency airflow, protection against sinin, and providing self-protective tools when meeting with COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers the health power and body room spread to people who are known or expected to suffer from high exposure COVID-19, which increases to high risk if the worker performs an aerosol procedures on, or takes or handles the specimens of, the person who is known or expected to suffer COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard control for this worker includes technical control, such as negative pressure ventilation room, and self-protection device that is appropriate for the job assignment.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because they are sick, have to care for someone else, or are afraid of the prospect of transportation.
Trade patterns can change, either in the kind of stuff that is asked or in the way of getting these things (like shopping outside the busy hour, through delivery, or wake up).
In the end, shipments of items from highly affected geographical areas COVID-19 can be disrupted. Thepsychiatry and plan to perform infection disease can be used to guide the protective action.
Plans consider the risks associated with various workplaces and work assignments, including the source of parenting, the risk posed by household and society, and the risk factors of each worker, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also outlined the necessary controls to address the risk and emergency plans for situations that might result from the plague.
Thepsychiatry and the plan for the removal of contagious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objective of removing the plague includes reducing the traffic between the staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The level of disease disease in the community where business is affecting the action taken.
Hazard control hierarchy is a work environment that is widely used in safety and health work to block the control of danger based on its effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last of its own protective tools.
Technical control includes insulating employees from work-related hazards without depending on the behavior of the workers and can be the most costly solution to apply.
Administrative control is a change in employment policies or procedures that require the action of a worker or a worker.
Self-protection (APD) is considered less effective than technical and administrative control, but can help prevent part of the parentage.
All types of ODA should be selected on the basis of danger to the worker, properly installed as is the case (for example, breathing), consistently and properly worn, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration, low - cost jobs have minimal contact with the public and other employees.
Steps to prevent basic infections that are recommended for all workplaces include washing hands in a proper manner, prompting workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics includes covering cough and sine, providing tissue and trash, preparing work from distant or shift work on time arrivals/early arrivals, if necessary, informing workers not to use the tools and equipment of others, and doing cleaning and disinfecting the work environment routinely.
Fast identification and isolation of potential individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free of fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of the fever or other symptoms, and so that the disease policy is flexible, allowing employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and so that employees know about this policy.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk include jobs that require close contact or often within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not known or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of a traffic jam in the community around the business location, or because someone has just made an international trip to the location with a wide-ranging COVID-19.
This group includes workers who have contact with public society such as at school, working environment with high population densities, and high volume rites. Technical controls for this group and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation levels, installing physical barriers like plastics tending to sneezes, and installing drive-thru windows or heights for customer services. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include pushing sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, making rotations with time arrival/returns, removing non-essential travel to a location that is undergoing a COVID-19 disease, developing a plan for communication usually includes the forum to respond to the workers' interests, equipping workers with education and training with the most relevant skills of the COVID and can serve as a protection, training that is necessary for clothing and use in terms of skills, skills and skills, skills and skills that are useful in use.
Workers in these risk groups rarely need respirators.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers includes separating the sick from others within 6 feet, showing one of the cabins to take care of the sick, and offering a mask for the sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a cough or sneeze.
You're going to have to wear medical gloves when treating a sick passenger or touching the body fluid or potentially contaminated surface, and maybe another protective device if an ill passenger has fever, coughs constantly, or breathing difficulties.
The gloves and other items should be disposed of in a bag of life-threatening hazards, and the contaminated surface must be cleaned and disinfected after that, and for commercial voyages, including passenger ships and other passenger ships, the control of the danger involves delaying the journey if it is sick, isolated itself, and informing the medical center on the ship immediately if someone has a fever or other symptoms when it is on the ship.
Ideally, further medical action is done in the cabins of people isolated. Apart from the public, for schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if infected people have ever been in the school building.
If there is a transmission in society at the minimum level up to now, a social screening strategy can be applied, which includes: canceling field visits, meetings, and a large group, such as physical education, voice conflict classes, or eating in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between desks, arrivals and standard departures, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health offices locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high spread in local society, in addition to a social rehabilitation strategy, the lengthening of school closures can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, the risk of direct health risks is considered low by the CDC.
The law enforcement officer must contact the person confirmed or expected COVID-19 recommended to follow the same guidance as the emergency medical technician, including using the appropriate protection device.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers should clean up and disinfect the belts and work supplies before they are used again by using a household spray or laptop and follow standard operation procedures to control and dispose of old ODA and to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers that certain body powers and bodies are at high risk or are very high.
High-risk work includes health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation equipment that are exposed to known patients or is expected to be COVID-19.
This job becomes a very high risk if the worker performs aerosol production procedures on, or takes or handles the specimens of, a patient known or suspected COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, coughing induction procedures, bronkoscopes, some procedures and dental checks, or invasive inspection procedures.
The work of high-risk morgue rooms includes workers involved in preparing the body of known or suspected COVID-19 cases at death; this work becomes very high risk if the worker performs autopsy. Additional technical controls for this group of risks include isolation rooms for known or expected COVID-19 patients, including when the aerosol output procedure is performed.
Ventilation of special negative pressure may be appropriate in some health care and mortuary.
Specimen must be dealt with with with a Level Emergency Level of Biological Safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who have come to be separated into a different waiting room based on whether they are suspected of a COVID-19 case. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends a respirator for those who work within 6 feet of the known patients or are suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the person who performs aerosol-bearing procedure.
In the United States, a N95 filter capper or better NIOSH should be used in written and comprehensive breathing protection contexts that include adjustment tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and increase the comfort of the workers. WHO does not recommend the entire or coverall clothing because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and not transmitted through the body fluid.
WHO only recommended surgical masks for scrine officers at the entrance point.
For a person who takes breathing specimens, treats, or transports COVID-19 patients without aerobic procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, clothing, and gloves.
If the aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by the N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Considering that the APD supply is not sufficient throughout the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through long-range medical services, physical caps like a blindfold window, with only those involved in the immediate treatment can enter the room with the patient COVID-19, use only the required APD for a specific task, continue to use the same respirator without releasing it when taking care of many patients with the same diagnosis, monitor and coordinate the supply chain APD, and do not stimulate the use of masks for people without symptoms.

BARIS SUBJEK: [Cvid-19] Reduces the burden and prepares the future
PACKAGE LEAFLET: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No rights protected
We found ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes it clear the global human and responsible relationship that we have to each other.
We have never had the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and global community building, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we have witnessed among all our fellow workers by e-mails, calls, and conversations are an incredible validation of extraordinary humans, which we are lucky enough to work with.
Thank you and I'm so proud of myself that I can call you an associate.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for the present world to access Wikipedia and how powerful this is for this valuable resource to remain available to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site keeps running, helps pay for our colleagues, or helps keep our community safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially now.
This is the moment when not only the work we do but the way we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work schedule and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was a proper response to the challenges we faced and the best way to maintain the survival of the organization throughout this time.
We really want to eliminate the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily routine is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notification is made.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
But the world cannot be predicted at this time, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shopping for the needs of trees, or going to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your working time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been necessary, but we're saying it.
Sick leave or PTO is not necessary, enough to know your manager and help your team review the calendar and schedule to make sure the main areas of work can be resolved.
(If you are diagnosed positively with COVID-19, please tell Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and make sure your situation gets the right attention from management).
The partners whose wages are hour-based will be paid full.
We have said it, and say it again, to respect our commitment to the contractors' partners and the clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours.
It's included if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use jobs as a way of stressing the world around us.
Our work can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and Dana Collection Team, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all the departments to assess the current purpose and divert our focus to support the essentials of our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus full on the most essential project.
Slowing now will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning on "working late" after this pandemic passed.
You won't be expected to work late to meet the unrealistic deadline at this time.
We realize that the situation has changed and will try to set a new target and timeline if necessary.
What about the Annual Plan?
To adjust to the new reality and the day - to - day schedule, we were to adjust the time line for the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We mean to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make the budget so that employees can prioritize important work, care, and care for loved ones while hosting them that they need or want to work with less schedule for the next few weeks.
The length of the timeline greatly reduces the workload and the current planning pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposals to the Council next week and update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, station, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our partners based on SF might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great concern, we hired anti-virus cleaning crew to disinfect all surface in San Francisco's office.
They use hospital-based antivirus to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
The building implements its own safety protocol by using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We're happy that the office will be ready to use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol with us and all of the staff members based on DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a long-distance service, on a journey with a guide to San Francisco.
As some of our fellow students are based in NYC, we are also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work far away for the first time.
Our old colleagues have been working long distances knowing that it may require adjustments and they want to give you advice:
The longest fixed-duration battle for one or two hours.
If the longer session is required, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Define a meeting clearly, for the agenda, and send out previous publications.
Make the video as the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Show leaders to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor conversations for questions and record the list of speakers, and someone to help make records (or make collaborative records).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy little food.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about the shared work
The SDM Operation Team is looking for a webinar-based ergonomics guide to support the increase in the distributed work throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all the beneficiaries of the community funding to cancel the public event that was funded by the Wikimedia, like Edit-a-thon, until WHO declared the pandemic was over.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellation and other limitations could make them impossible to complete the approved activity and that no one would be given a pinealtic because they had to delay or modify the target.
This weekend we will continue with an additional guide on Wikimania and the regional community conference and other themes.
In general, feelings from the entire global community seem to be a sadness over this disorder, but at the same time relief from clarity and the ability to focus on their own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Next, CRT is trying to prepare a page at Meta-Wiki to provide community space to monitor the effects and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send you an invitation to your calendar for Thursday coming at 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can keep getting information from this email and all the essential information related to COVID-19 at Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all information is in one place.
We also seek to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, main workflows, or problems about speech, or other matters that may require help, do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and become a link as needed.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations International SDM.
There is no such change as our job and our obligation.
On the other hand, this change is a confession that, at this time, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are the steps that we believe are important in supporting each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need to move, and give the world of service that they rely on.
The work we've planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and create space for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months to come.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so you can work well when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other leadership team members (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzym angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and gut.
ACE2 has anti-angiotensin (ACE) anti-angiotensin (ACE) enzyme activity, reducing the number of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also functions as a point of entry into the cell for some coronavirus.
ACE2 human version is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzymes are metaloenzyms that are located on the surface of endothel cells and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has M2 domain peptidease terminal-N and domain transporter amino renal collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single type I bypass membrane protein, with an enzyme active domain found on the surface of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extrasel domain ACE2 is separated from the transmegran domain by another enzyme, known as the sheddase, and the extended protein produced released into the blood stream and eventually exported into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the membrane of the cell, especially the type II alveolar lung cell, the enteritis of small intestines, the blood and vein endothel cells, and the pulmonary muscle cells of most organs.
MRNA ACE2 expression was also found in cerebral cortex, stritatus, hypothalamus, and brain stems.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE evaluator.
ACE breaks angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cut the amino phenylalanine terminal acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis became angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, melanin, neurotensine, diorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also arranges traffic membrane transporter amino neutral acid SLC6A19 and involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembran protein, ACE2 functions as a primary entry point into the cell for some coronavirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (sarrival causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (savirus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the use of S1 protein in spleen or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface causes endocytosis and viral transfer and enzyme into the endosomals located in the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires the protease of S protein by the serum protease of the TMPRSS2, which is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesize that the decrease of ACE2 in the cell may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing therapy with standard ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic and meta-analysis study published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors caused a decrease of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
In addition, "use of the ACE inhibitor also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients with higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with the reduction of pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are less powerful than the risk of complete pneumonia."
ACE2 human combination (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase the hemodynamics of lung and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipolisakarida.
The rhACE2 part time in humans is about 10 hours with 30 minutes working time besides 24 hours effect (duration).
Some findings indicate that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance against classical renin-angiotensin (RAS inhibitor) inhibitors or in angiotensin II disease in increased blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory syndrome.
b'Application COVID-19 is the software software application that was designed to help track contacts to bridge the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people who may have contacted those who are infected.
Many applications were developed or proposed, which received official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Some workplans to build contacts tracking applications have been developed.
The issue of privacy is questioned, especially related to a system based on the geographical location of the application user.
An alternative that does not involve too much privacy includes the use of Bluetooth signal to record the user's proximity to another phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and iOS operating system.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed applications that allow people to check whether they have been in contact with the COVID-19 sufferer.
This application is used in more than 200 Tiokok cities, and in Singapore, it is used by TraceTogether.
This application is developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be delivered to the government. North Macedonia launches "StopCorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track the patterns of people who are potentially infected and respond quickly to the health care authority.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, the application is still waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that a contact tracking application is in the process of further development and will be available for distribution within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and France ("StopCvid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore and BlueTrace protocols. Russia means introducing geophencing applications for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur on a application-based system, which includes false positive and possibly poor effectiveness if the data taken is limited to a small part of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of a misleading or dangerous coronavirus application, Apple sets limits on the kind of organization that can add the associated coronavirus application to the App Store, which means limiting only for a "branch" organization or has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply similar constraints.
Privacy supporters express their concern about the mass surveillance involvement using coronavirus applications, especially about whether the monitoring infrastructures made to handle the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement that sets limits on such surveillances.
This organization states eight terms on the government project:
surveillance must be "according to the law, necessary, and proportionate";
monitoring and monitoring must have a sunset;
data usage must be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital monitoring must avoid the worst discrimination and marginalization;
each data division with the third party must be defined in the laws;
there must be protection against misuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
participation means all of my "relevant interests" required, which includes community health experts and online groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan means to deal with ongoing monitoring problems by eliminating tracking mechanisms from the device operating system after it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based site tracking, rather than applications, so that it removes the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel a network - based climber was approved.
A network-based solution that has access to raw location data has the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with the central server need to access personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use the central server only for intercom (see below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used for tracking contacts.
Instead of using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes data tracking mobile devices and card transaction data, and merges this information to generate notification through text messages to people who are potentially infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the public, which is permitted by extensive changes in the privacy laws of information after the MERS is seized in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using systems that are embedded while protecting privacy.
By April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
The search for privacy-protected contacts is a well-marked concept, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts working privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user's proximity to another phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that includes a centralised and decentralised approach, rather than a single protocol. The protocol is decentralised to include a Decentralised Privacy Communication (DP-PPT/DP-3T), a Timely Contact Number (TCN, previously called a Contact Genesis Number, CEN), a Protocol and a Sensitive Private Search Mechanism (PCT), and others.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified never leaves the device, and all the couplings occur on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, a platform to use a technique that protects privacy when collecting and using the location or cross-sectional data to track the COVID-19 distribution.
This was based on a study of the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released on March 2020. Another similar effort was the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was also established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share locations and sensitive health data with other users and officers without sacrificing the data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was founded by groups with a common approach and is a very dense protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key aspect in achieving broad acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that they had made BlueTrace protocols that were used by its official government's application as an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative for tracking contacts, which they claimed will protect privacy, based on the combination of Low Energy Bluetooth technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also set out the basic technology specifications that are used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to be launched in three stages:
launch tool to allow the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this function directly to the iOS and Android Google and Apple plans to address data collection and monitoring issues continues at first to distribute the system through the update of the operating system, and remove it in the same way after the threat passes.
b'Reposition drugs (also called a new purpose, a new profile, or a new task on a drug or a therapeutic choice) are intended to be used for new treatment purposes, for a different medical condition or disease with the initial purpose of drug development.
This path is a scientific research path that is currently being carried out to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
The direction of other research includes the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several sites of binding.
Analysis of such linkage sites can be the basis for effective antiviral development of COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papa-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP-ribophosphatase-like protease.
Hussein A A, et al polled some of the candidates that were subsequently optimized and analyzed with approved drugs and had the highest taste to speed up the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potassium in its clinical study to be recommended in clinical study design.
Chlorokuin is an antimalaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin were two of the four drugs to be tested as part of the Solidaritas clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin tests in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorokuin sulphate and phosphate chlorokuin based on the U.S.
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial and U.S.-based authorisation only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who have been treated poorly, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "use, dose, or duration of hydroxychlorokuin for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been set.
Doctors say they use that medicine when there's no other choice.
A Turkish team of researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study of the use of chlorokuin combined with rice, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
High school is ongoing at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and safety test of the preventive use of hydroxychlorokuin.
Tiokok clinical trial in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved "effectively accurate."
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were tested negative in the median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the medication.
In a study carried out in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipyravir and half of them received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Corps remind the public that evidence exists to support the medication little and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan for supplies and use the military to send the medicine to the university hospital, where it would be used to treat the patients with COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to Trump's government about the drug purchase, which may be less effective in cases of multiple-ply disease.
This medicine may not be safe if you are used by a pregnant mother or someone who is trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), which is the combination of the antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "there is no known benefit".
This drug was designed to slow the replication of HIV by binding protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that will be linked to SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in scientific society about the provision of resources to reposition drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO inserts lopinavir/ritonavir into international Solidaritas trials.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against some philosophers, pneumo-, paramigo-, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can cause more severe diseases and transmissions.
Some early trials showed that remdesivir may have high genetic resistance. There are some ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials performed by the Cleveland University Hospital, one for the sick and one for the sick.
There are three clinical trials being carried out for intravenous vitamin C for those who are treated with inept and severe COVID-19 disease, namely two controlled plasebones (Thirkok, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began testing for azitromisin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning clinical trials for Alvesco (cyclesonide) Teijin, cortikosteroid inhalation for asthma, for treatment of new, pragmatic coronavirus infection patients.
For a form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, Phase II trial is being conducted with 200 patients will be recruited from a severe case of inept treatment in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to find out the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently examining the role of collkisin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, given the name COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms so as not to require inhalation.
A woman who is pregnant or who has been harassed or who has not used effective contraception is unqualified.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low - molecular heparin has been used to treat patients extensively so that the Italian Medicines Authority has been moved to publish the guidance on their use.
A multi-centered study of 300 patients who studied the use of enoxaparin sodium at a prophylaxis and therapeutic dose was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention is focused on giving the purpose of new treatment to the virus that is approved and developed for a previous outbreak, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the 7th edition of Tiokkok
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-
Some antibiotics that are identified potentially as a drug that can be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Adopted by Tiokok.
Besides, the tests are also performed in Italy and Tiokok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaksin COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet been completed, there is much effort being made to develop the vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the tausatif virus of this disease, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The great plague spread throughout the world in 2020, which led to investment and major research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop vaccines that could possibly be opposed to SARS-CoV-2.
CEPI's initiative gave a statement in April that the thing to be observed in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, distribution on a required scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI reported that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development during early 2020 to make effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform target that progresses to Phase I security study, includes:
nucleat acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (phase I and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others are announced, but with little public information available (considered being planned or planned).
Phase I-II tests early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed at random, controlled plasaebo, and at some locations, determining a more accurate effective dose.
Phase III test usually involves more participants, including control groups, and testing vaccine effectiveness to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 of them are not in human evaluation (also in the "praclinis" research).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that they were investigating the potential of molecular seal vaccines that would genetically modify virus proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccinal Center at Saskatchewan University announced that they began developing vaccines, with a 2021 human test target.
The vaccine development project was announced at the T-T-T-T-Konk Disease Control and Control Center on January 26, 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on January 28th.
On January 29, 2020, the Farmasi Janssen company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they began to develop vaccines.

OncoGen laboratory in Romania published on 8 February 2020 a description of vaccine design with technology similar to the technology used for neoantigen cancer vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research agency announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and would start testing.
On February 27, 2020, the son of the company Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that they began a vaccine project to make the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce vaccine candidates that can be tested on humans "in 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop vaccines.
On March 5, 2020, U.S. Research Command and United States Army forces in Fort Detrick and Walter Reed Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced that they were developing vaccines.
On March 10, 2020, the Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were working with Novavax Inc.
in the development and development of vaccines.
In addition, this partnership includes a preclinical and clinical trial plan Phase I in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Health Ministry announced that they were working 11 isolates, and even on a rapid route, the development of vaccines took at least one and a half years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of particles similar to coronavirus with partial recruitment from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with testing of humans planned in July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian reported that the U.S. President Donald Trump had offered "'a large amount of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine' to CureVac, protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, Pfizer's pharmaceutical company announced a partnership with a German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, the vaccine candidate is based on mRNA, BNT162, being in a preclinical test with clinical tests expected to start in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that they would receive the results of clinical testing in April 2020 and the vaccine candidate at the end may begin to test humans in autumn.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Innovation Coalition of Epidemi's Studies (CEPI) announced a total investment of US$4.9 million in the consortium of vaccine research COVID-19 involving Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and Pittsburgh University, with a total investment of CEPI in the development of COVID-19 vaccines to US$29 million.
Another ECI investment strategy for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had initiated six vaccine candidates on animals.
Imperial College London researcher announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing RNA vaccines that could expand themselves for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed in 14 days after receiving a follow-up from Tiokok.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced a funding of C$275 million for 96 medical research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiative and Saskatchewan University.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced a C$192 million special funding to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to set up a national vaccine bank with some new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus plague occurred.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University Medical School reported PittCoVacc's examination, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, in rats; they stated that "MNA that gives S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines results in specific antibodies response that can be taken [on rats] that start to look 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the Pharmacy Faculty of Waterloo University announced a DNA-based vaccine candidate design as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA is designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless like-virus particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
By March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access the supercomputers of IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, which are also called non-specific effects.
It means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease that prevented them.
More tracking tests in Australia are trying to track 4,170 health officers.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess vaccine honesty uses specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-manufacturer primates, shows the need for steps to achieve the level of biological safety 3 in addressing life viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on a model of non-manufactured animals.
By 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that is proven safe and effective in humans.
According to the research published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and health institutions around the world. Furthermore, proven vaccines for MERS have not yet existed.
When MERS becomes prevalent, an established SARS research can be a useful template to develop vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infections.
By March 2020, one Mers (DNA-based) vaccine completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines in process, which are all virus vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media post promotes conspiracy theory claiming a virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccine has been available.
The patents quoted by various social media sites refer to the patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronaviruses, such as corronavirus SARS.
b'Choronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by koronavirus heavy breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
Time from exposure to symptoms in general was about five days, but could range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and failure to perform a miracle.
By April 17, 2020, over 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. This virus mainly spreads interhumanism when close contact occurs, often through sparks or small droplets produced through coughs, sinews, or when speaking.
Despite the result when breathing, droplets are usually dropped to the ground or to the surface rather than transmitted to the distance.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is very contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the next stage of the disease. Standard diagnostic method is with the reaction of the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) on the nasopharynx.
The use of masks is encouraged by people who are suspected of being infected with viruses and people who take care of them.
Recommendation regarding the use of masks by different publics; some authorities recommend not using masks, some recommend using masks, and others impose the use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People infected with viruses can be free of symptoms or symptoms such as flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathlessness.
Emergency symptoms include breathing, pain or pain in the chest that continues, confusion, difficulty getting up, and face or lips; medical withdrawal is advised immediately if these symptoms appear.
Upper breathing symptoms, such as sinews, ingestions, or throat pains, can be found, but more rarely.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in large percentages.
Some of the cases in the beginning in Tiokok were only with a description of a chest-crushed and palpitated clinical condition.
In some people, disease can develop into pneumonia, the failure of an ape organs, and death.
It is called the time of incubation.
Incubation time for COVID-19 usually takes five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who are sprawling will experience symptoms in 11.5 days of infection. Report shows that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of the bearer without symptoms is not fully known; however, initial evidence indicates that they may contribute to the preaching of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms not yet known and are being examined, with the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Center (KCDC) reported that 20% of all cases confirmed remained without symptoms during treatment in the hospital.
The Tiokok National Health Commission began to report the case without any symptoms in the daily case on April 1st; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and clay water can carry the charge of viruses on a large scale.
Speaking with heights release more sparks or droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that unplugged cough can cause droplets to be pushed up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not transmitted through air, the United States National Science Academy shows that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air-gatherers placed in the hallways outside the room produce a positive sample for RNA viruses.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the lung heart (RJP), can make the respiratory secret changes into aerosols and spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through a phase, it is considered a low risk.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others.
Specifically, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard/cardus, up to three days on plastic (polypropylen) and solid steel (ISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products degrade the fat of a virus protector, activate the virus, and release it from the skin and the other surface.
Other streams, such as chlorida benzalkonium and chlorhexidine glukonat, are less effective.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus load, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus load at the second day test.
Koronavirus heavy acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new heavy breathing coronavirus, the first time isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a classic case of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features are on the coronavirus that is related to the nature.
Outside the human body, this virus was killed by a household soap, which damaged its protective bubble.
The lung is the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses angina cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, the most abundant in lung type II alveolar cells.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or tonjolane" to connect to the ACE2 and enter the blood cells.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of infected people who were treated poorly in Wuhan, Tiokok, and more often in severe diseases.
High cardiovascular symptoms are due to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute miokard injuries may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in heart function.
High thrombosis (31%) and high venous thromboembolism (25%) found in patients of COVID-19 infection in ICU and may be related to a bad prognosis. Autopsy in people who died because of COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and infiltrate inflammations that contain lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropics for the epitel of the breathing channel expressing ACE2, patients with heavy COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, T-cells that secrete the GM-CSF pathogens are proven to be correlated with monocysts that secrete the IL-6 inflammatory and severe lung pathology of the COVID-19 patient.
Lymphocytic infiltration is also reported on autopsy.
WHO has established some testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is the reaction of the polymerase chain of real-time transcription (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed in the respiratory sample obtained by the nasopharynx; however, the nasal orputum sample can also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it takes two blood samples taken within two weeks so that the results have a small time value.
The Chinese scientist is able to isolate this coronavirus gallus and release its genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can develop independent polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) independently to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, an antibodium test (which can detect active infection and if someone has previously been infected) is in development, but not widely used.

The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The diagnostics issued by the U.S. University Whah Hospital suggest a method of detecting infections based on clinical images and epidemiological risks.
Ground-glass bilateral multi-bar opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetric, and posteriorly found much at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy showing (lobular septum balance with variable alveolar filling), and consolidasis may appear as a result of disease development.
A little data is available on microscopic and pathophysiology COVID-19.
The main pathological finding on autopsy is:
Makroscopies: pleurisis, pericarditis, lung consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of pneumonia virus can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyt hyperplasia, large-typing pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the establishment of giant cells with many components
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar output.
DAD is the cause of acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in healing stage: high levels of alveolar bronchi and interstitial fibrosis pulmonary
Blood: intravascular coagulation is presented (DIC); leukoerethroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends closing your mouth and nose with the tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommend using the inside of your elbow if the tissue is not available.
A suitable hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of face closures from cloths in general, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. The social screening strategy aims to reduce contact with people infected with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public.
Compulsory regulations also include keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1,8 meters.
There is no known effective cure to prevent COVID-19.Because the vaccine is not yet there until the beginning of 2021, the main part of handling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the top of the epidemic, which is known as a "curve rate".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after toilets or when hands look dirty, before eating, and after spreading noses, coughs, or sinews.
Further CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand service that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand service is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not active substance for hand antiseptics".
Glyserol added as a wettan.
People are treated with support, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect them carry a virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure problems, but its benefits are still considered.
Self-cleanness and lifestyle and eating patterns are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful to those with mild symptoms at the early stages of infection. WHO and the T-T-Kkok National Health Commission have published recommendations to deal with the N-COVID-19 sufferer.
Intensive care workers and lung workers in the U.S. have developed recommendations for treatment from various agencies to be free of charge, i.e. IBM.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical energy recommended paraetamol (astaminofen) compared to ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautionary action should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in the care of health care when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For the health force that treats COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the U.S. Tullar Infection Space (IAIR) other than using standard precaution, contact precaution, and self-precaution. CDC provides guidance for the use of self-protective devices (APDs) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: APD clothing, respiratory or facial masks, eye protectors, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not face masks) are better.
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial control, but the FDA has authorized these masks to be used according to the U.S. Emergency Use Authority.
N95 respirators are designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified use in the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection or, as a last effort, artificial masks themselves.
Most COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but in some cases they are heavy.
Type of respiratory support for people who have failed to breathe related COVID-19 is active for those who are treated in the inapest, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-flow nasal canal or bipositive air vent pressure.
Didn't know if one of these two methods had the same benefits for those who were critically ill.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts the circulation of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal canals. The case is more severe in age (those over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old).
Many advanced countries do not have enough capita hospital beds, which limit the capacity of the health system to handle the surge suddenly number of cases of COVID-19 which are quite severe so it takes inap.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the COVID-19 sufferers who were treated in the end came into the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) occurs at COPID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilator capable of doing pressure control mode and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury and ventilator-related pneumothoracs.
The high PEEP may not be available on the old fan.
Research on potential treatment began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trial.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drug development may take time up to 2021, some drugs being tested have been approved for another use or are in further testing.
Antiviral drugs can test people with severe diseases.
Volunteers who recommend WHO are also involved in tests of potential efficacy and safety treatment. FDA has given temporary authorisation for convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in the case of someone's life very or even threatened.
Plasma convalesen has not yet conducted a necessary clinical trial to prove the safety and efficacy of the disease.
In February 2020, Tiokok launched a mobile application to deal with the disease.
User is asked to enter their name and ID number.
This application can detect 'close counter' using surveillance data so it can detect the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends independent quarantines, but also tells local health officers. Analysts data on cell data, facial recognition technology, cellular tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those who are in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
By March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security services to track the data of suspected coronavirus.
That step is taken to treat quarantine and protect people who might contact infected citizens.
Moreover, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of viruses.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera, said he was told that the mobile operator "40% of the citizens still move places."
The German government did the hackathon at the end of 48 hours with more than 42,000 participants.
Furthermore, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, issued a global call for a creative solution against the coronavirus distribution.
Stress can be caused by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Rather than social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic depression are a perfect storm that endangers mental health and the well-being of the community."
This disease can continue mildly with little or no symptoms, which resemble other general respiratory tract disease, such as a pill.
A mild case usually heals in two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for heavy COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COPID-19 is still less likely. For some people, COVID-19 can influence the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the worst affected person, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or failure of an organ.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood users, and heart, kidney, and heart damage.
Blood disaggregating, especially an increase in prothrombin time, observed in 6% of patients treated with inept COVID-19, while the abnormal kidney function is seen at 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 image show increased heart enzymes (transamine).
According to the same report, the median time between symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in the inhalation rate.
However, the patients transferred to the ICU have an average of seven days between the rate of inap and death.
In a study of early cases, the median time from early symptoms to death is 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in Tiokok, a man had a death count of 2.8%, while women had a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung sample shows diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid content in both lungs.
The cytopathic changes of the virus were observed in pneumocytes.
Image of the lung resembles acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Tiokok National Health Commission, acute heart damage, with increased troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people who are cared for inaccuracies have their own conditions.
Estimates of mortality vary due to the differences in the area, but also because of methodological difficulties.
Unless the calculation of a minor case can cause the death rate to be calculated too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of a case that has taken place in the past can mean the number of deaths currently being counted is too low.
Perocok has the possibility of 1.4 times more severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers. There is concern about the duration of this disease.
The authority of Hong Kong Hospital found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some who recovered from the disease, and lung screening showed organ damage.
It can also cause anxiety-intensive syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it has not been known that previous infections give effective and long-term immunity to people who recover from this disease.
Immunities may be viewed, if you see another coronavirus behavior, but have reported that there is a case healing COVID-19 followed by a positive corronavirus test a few days later.
The case is believed to be a severe leftover infection, and not a re-infection.
This virus is believed to be natural and comes from animals, through widespread infections.
In fact, it is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of infection is almost entirely driven by transmission from man to man.
A study of 41 confirmed first COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest warning date of December 1, 2019.
Official publication of WHO reported the earliest symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This number varies by region and time, and is influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for death due to confirmed laboratory SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for death due to COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without confirmation of laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death ratio in case reflects the number of deaths in the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time range.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the death rate for the case in general is 6.9% (153,822/2.240,191) by April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Another measurement includes the number of fatalities in the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from certain diseases, and the number of fatalities in the infection (IFR), which reflect the percentage of those infected (diagnosis and non-diagnosis) who die from certain diseases.
This statistic is timeless and following a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people create antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people who have been infected.
At the outbreak of an outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) has died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread through the Karnaval festival, which spread among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all of the COVID-19 deaths were possibly classified as COVID-19 deaths.
In addition, the German health system has not yet grown under control.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to have died because of COVID-19.
The pandemic and mortality levels are different for both men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in Tiokok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with a different risk between new men and women not seen at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The reason for such a difference is certainly not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be an excuse.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower smoking prevalence in women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at younger ages than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people are men and 72% are men who died because of COVID-19.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track the related sex data for COVID-19 infection.
Research indicates that virus disease, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affects men and women differently.
The percentage of health workers with a higher gender gender, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance to report the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
The WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is short for crown, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time the plague was identified: 31 December 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (such as Tiokok), species of animals, or a group of people, along with international recommendations for an attempt to prevent stigmatization. A virus that causes COVID-19 was called a koronavirus heavy breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communication.
Both disease and enzyme virus are called coronavirus.
At the beginning of the plague in Wuhan, Tiokok, the virus and the disease are called coronavirus and coronavirus Wuhan.
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and aut 2019-nCov respiratory disease as a temporary name for viruses and disease according to the 2015 guidelines that required not to use the location name in the name of the disease and viruses.
Official name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on February 11, 2020.
Because of the limited capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal vortex and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital is in great need of ventilator valves, and an installer cannot provide within the required timescale, a local company is inverted and printing 100 valves required last night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 disease, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and disinformation arose about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and aspects of other diseases, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread viruses to several other animals.
Study failed to find evidence of replication of the virus on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no drug or vaccine approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization practiced "SOLIDARITY Trial" to examine the effects of treatment of four existing antivirals with the most promising honesty.
Vaccines are not available yet, but various institutions are active in developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were both using the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First of all, the researcher intends to make a complete vaccine virus.
The use of the virus, either an inactive or dead virus, is intended to rapidly trigger the human body's immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine, is designed to create vaccines that make immune systems sensitive to specific subunits in viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on S-spike protein that helps virus abuse the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making vaccination).
The experimental vaccine that these strategies are designed should be tested to find out the safety and accuracy of these strategies. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain a harmless genetic code that is copied from a virus that causes disease. The increase of the anti-antibodies has been suggested as a potential challenge for developing the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials ongoing in April 2020.
Seven trials try to evaluate the treatment that has been approved for malaria, including four studies against hydroxychlorokuin or chlorokuin.
The newly targeted antivirus drug formed most of the Chinese research, with nine Phase III tests on remdesivir in some countries with speed of reporting at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 has been in place.Some of the antiviral drugs currently being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, which included remdesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxychlorokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir were combined with interferon beta.
By March 2020, there was temporary evidence for the integrity of remdesivir.
Clinical enhancements were observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being performed in the United States, China, and Italy.
However, there is a call for an international review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorokuin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending one gram daily dose, notes that twice the dose is very dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, FDA issued authorisation for emergency use for hydroxychlorokuin and chlorokuin on the policies of a doctor who was in charge of COVID-19.The 7th edition of Tiokok also included interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Initial data shows that a ribavirin high dose is required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo study after showing low concentration SARS-CoV-2 bondage. Studies have shown that the initial preliminum against tonjolan protein by transmegran 2 (TMPRSS2) prosthesis is very important to input SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chlorokuin and hydroxychlorokuin with or without azitromysin has a great limitation that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a role known in the treatment of COVID-19.
The complexions of the cytokine storm can occur at the COVID-19 heavy next stage.
There is evidence that hydroxychlorokuin may have an antisitokin trait. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment procedure by the T-T-Kkok National Health Commission after a little research has been completed.
This drug is undergoing phase 2 tests at a national level in Italy after showing positive results on people with severe diseases.
Combined with a serum felitin blood test to identify a cytokine storm, this drug is intended to combat a cytokine storm, which is expected to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of cytokine refractive steroids induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
Until now, there has been no random and controlled evidence showing that tocilizumab is an accurate treatment for CRS.
Transfers refined and sharpened antibodies produced by a human system that has been cured from COVID-19 to those in need are being identified as a non-vaccin passive immunization method.
This strategy is tested for SARS with inconclusive results.
The neutralization of viruses is a working mechanism expected for passive antibodies therapy that can mediate defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, another mechanism, such as cellular cytotoxicity that depends on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may also be.
Another passive antibodies form, for example, using produced monochlonal antibodies, in development.
Convalescent serum production, which is a portion of the blood that has been cured and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be enhanced for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of severe-related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Center Hospital, who later became infected and died because of COVID-19 after exposing awareness of the spread of the virus.
