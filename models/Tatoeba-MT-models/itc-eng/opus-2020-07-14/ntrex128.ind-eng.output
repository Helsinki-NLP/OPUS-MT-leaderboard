The Council members (AM) Welsh worry if they're "acting like a muppet doll."
There was concern among some AMs about a suggestion that they should be changed to MWPs.
This arose because of plans to change the name of the Majelis into the Welsh Parliament.
The AMs all over the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite me.
An AM labor party said that his group was concerned, "It's a coincidence with Twp and Pwp."
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the council (AM) said that his group as one unit, felt "unfavourable" and had proposed some alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group "open thoughts" about the change of names, but judged that this is a confrontation of MWP being Muppet.
In this context, your letter in Welsh is spoken as u-letters in English Yorkshire.
The council's current committee established laws to introduce the change of name, saying, "The last decision on any explanation of the name for the AM is of course a problem for the members themselves."
The 2017 Wales government's decision gave the Council of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the public consultation results on a proposal known to be widely supported to refer to the Council as the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the problem of AM, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Parliament Welsh), but MWP options get the greatest support for public consultation.
The AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could displace the chief, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the billing plans for the change within a few weeks.
These reformers will include other changes about how to work in writing, including disqualified rules for AMs and committee system plans.
The AM will get a final voice about how they should be called when they discuss the invitations.
Macedonian society went to give voice to referendums on country-name change
The voice owners will determine whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia Republic."
The prosecution was held in an effort to resolve disputes for a decade with Greek neighboring countries, also known as Macedonia.
Athena had long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country to the north showed a confession to her territory and had repeatedly rejected the EU-NATO membership offer.
President Makedonia Gjorge Ibanov, a voice-response opponent for a change of name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, felt that the change of name was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bell rings are undistorted when the churches in Harlem are having trouble.
"Historically, the parents I spoke to say once there was a bar and church in every corner," said Mr. Adam
"Today, there's none."
He said that all the bars were missing.
"People socialize in another way" now, he says.
"It's no longer a community living room around where people visit him regularly."
Likewise with the church, he was worried that money from the sale of assets wouldn't last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would come back from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by an apartment building with a condominium filled with people who would not help to keep the holy places around it.
"The superiority of the people who will buy condominium in these buildings is white," he said, "and that is why it will speed up the day when these churches are closed together because it is impossible for those who have moved to these buildings to become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the city of black metropolitans - metropolitan metropolitans in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white method of moving in the 1930s.
Black lepers who have been studying in the surrounding areas have taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black mob under the leadership of Priest John Howard, who led a boycott of the skyscraper on 125th Street, the main road to shopping in Harlem, who refused to work or promote blacks.
The 1939 fire caused the building to crash heavily, but when Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild, they built tower bells.
Dr. David Johnson, the Johnson Reverend's boy and his replacement in St. Martin proudly called the bell tower "The Lonces of the Poor"
An expert who rang the tower bell in July gave him another name: "A cultural treasure" and "an unchangeable historical instrument."
One expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also noted that this is the first tower bell tower in the world played by black musicians, Dionysio A. Lind who just rang the larger tower bells in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What's happened in Santo Martin for the last few months is an architectural story and complicated contractors, some of which have been brought by regular church leaders, and others brought to them by the episcopal exposition.
Westerners - the body responsible for the elections, formed by public leaders - wrote to the elections in July with the concern that "they will try to pay the costs" on the western parties, although the Westry is not involved in the architectural and contractors that were sent by the embezzlement.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency from the authorities.
Shark injured a 13-year-old in lobbyster rescue in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobster in California at the lobbying event of the lobster season, at the expense of an officer.
The attack occurred before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in Incinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been drowning with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then rowing together to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a thrill after catching the lobster, but then he "knowed" that the boy shouted, "I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
Hammel said that he realized when he caught the boy.
"I screamed to everyone out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Child Hospital in San Diego, where he was handled in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack are unknown.
The Captain of Larry Giles Beach Rescue said in the media conference that a shark had been seen in that area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim had a severe wound on the top of his body.
Officers closed access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most of them are considered harmless.
The plan of sciencebury breaks down the English beauty market
Sciencebury takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with kios-kios-kios-kios-like toserba style managed by specialist assistants.
As part of the substantial push towards the UK beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling fashion products and household equipment down, the larger beauty kios-kios will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more shops next year if it is proven successful.
Investment in beauty is a unique hunting ground for the supermarkets to take advantage of the racks that were used to be a place to hang TV, microwave, and household equipment.
Sciencebury said that it would double the offer of beauty to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of brands started from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more room with a marble area as found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also launched a refocusing of the boutique makeup so that most of the products would be friendly to vegans - things that the young shopkeepers are increasingly interested in.
In addition, the perfume hunter Fragrance Shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury stores, the first opened in Croydon. London south last week, while the two will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of the year.
Online shopping and requisitioning the daily needs of food in a small number of local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the executive head of Sainsbury, has said that the movements will become more like Mall when the supermarket chain tries to fight back the rescues like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and without food.
Science has placed Argos' movements in hundreds of shops and has also introduced some Habitat movements since they bought those two warheads two years ago, who said they had supported the sale of food daily and made more profitable acquisitions.
The previously supermarket effort to renovate beauty and pharmacy departments ended up with failure.
Scientificbury tested the efforts of Boots at the beginning of 2000, but the same work ended after there was an argument about how to share the profits of the chemical store in the supermarket.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceuticals shops to Celesio, the owner of Farmasi Lloyds, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding various brands of beautiful leather treatments including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said, "We've changed the look and feel on the beauty kios-kios to fix the mood for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our trademarks are designed according to all needs, the binding environment and the comfortable location of which we are now a betting destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "shut" after Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a £11 million deal.
Dragons Den Star, Peter Jones went "with excitement" after TV star Holly Willoughby pulled himself from a life-style business deal worth £11 million to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage the brand of household furniture and their accessory, Truly.
The business of this couple is compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Ptroew.
This Morning's interviewer, 37 years old, uses his Instagram account to announce that he's out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons' star Den, Petes Jones is mad at the pull of himself at the last few moments, from their lucrative life-style business to focus on his biggest contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Source stated that Jones was so "strong" when the golden girl TV admitted during a resounding meeting on Tuesday at his business government office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - means that he no longer had enough time to devote himself to the brand of household equipment and their accessory, Truly.
Their business has been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptorow and is expected to double Willoughby's wealth of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his holiday homes,
One source says: "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be his long-term future, which would last him for a few decades to come.
His decision to step back made all those involved very uncomfortable.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready to sell."
Experts believe that the travel of this Morning's event, which is one of the most expensive British stars, can harm the company up to millions of dollars because of major investment in product form, from pillows and candles to household clothing and equipment, and there is further potential for launch.
And this can mean the end of a long-term friendship relationship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and Tara Capp's wife for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, who was 52 years old, joined in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is going to be a brand leader for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV carrier named I'm A Celebrity.
A person close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speak seriously ‘and then we fall in love’
He's joking about the criticism he's going to get from the news media because he makes comments that some people consider to be "non-presidential" and has been very positive to the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump hand over so much?
Trump said it was his "new reader" with a funny voice.
"I don't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting two times after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which was praised by Trump as a step forward for the development of North Korea.
But the negotiation of incriminating has been halted.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, the highest diplomat North Korea Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders in. The General Council of the United Nations on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "appropriate responses" from the United States to the early North Korean arms movement.
On the contrary, he noted that the United States of America continued its determined sanctions to guard its pressure.
Trump was more optimistic about his speech.
"We did our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight with North Korea.
Millions will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship,"
He said that his success in repairing relationships with Kim has brought positive results - to stop rocket experiments, to help free hostages and bring back the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing towards the crowd that was right in front of him.
Indonesia’s Tsunami and the Storm Destroyed an Island, Killing Hundreds
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental foreign organization was told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the Lombok population have lost their homes, there is no national disaster statement, as a sign of international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've made it clear that they don't ask for international help, so this is a bit challenging," Mrs. Sumbún.
While Save The Children is teaming up to go to Palu, it's still not sure if the foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a national disaster relief officer, said that the Indonesian officials were examining the situation in the Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute aid.
In view of the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, this country is still very unprepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunami protection had been built in Aceh, it was not a public view of the other shoreline.
There was no tsunami warning siren in the Palu, even though a threat warning was reported, it is likely that it contributed to the existence of a life-threatening victim.
At the best of times, the journey between many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disaster makes logistics even more complicated.
The avocado hospital that has been located in the Lombok to care for the victims of an earthquake is heading toward the Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach a new disaster location.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to the damaged Indonesia infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on road and rail construction.
However, financial shortages disturbed Father Joko’s government while he was facing his election back next year.
Mr. Joko also experienced pressure from the lingering secular tension in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority had embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes when Muslim and Christian mobs fought on the streets, used darts, bows, and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge inserts a leading goal against Chelsea

Sturridge received bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside the Chelsea crew when the team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before kicking it to a distant pole.
The ball floated high above the hawk when the ball reached the right corner over the net.
The ball finally fell past the Arrizalaga Kepa that jumped and fell into the net.
"That's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it in front of as many as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Storridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just do a kick."
Chelsea leads with score 1-0 at the first half after Belgian player Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue attacker gave Mateo Kovacic back to the game, before turning near the middle line and running fast toward the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave the bait and ran in the middle.
He then made a perfect kick, led Hazard toward the gawg.
Hazard managed to get past the rivals and kick the ball to the corner of the gheng with the left foot kick, the Liverpool Kiper Alisson Becker.

The death victim of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The death toll on the earthquake and the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832, with the peak of the country’s disaster agencies on Sunday mornings.
Many are reported to be trapped in the ruins of a building that was destroyed by a 7.5-scale Earthquake Richter that struck on Friday and triggered a 20-foot-high wave, says Sutopo Purwo, an institution speaker at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which is home to more than 380,000 people, is filled by the ruins of a collapsed building.
Police arrested a man, 32 years old, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Murder investigation has been carried out after the body of a woman found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44 - year - old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John's road, at 7.55 a.m. with several coughing wounds, while a 32 - year - old man was held on suspicion of murder.

I also appeal to everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who might record something on the camera to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
The police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is the local Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still going on like what the police have said, they're in the process of telling the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews had just returned to his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
That man can't say anything when he knows what's going on.
Now the citizens are being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed to come back.
A police officer sounds like he's telling someone that all the areas are now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He's always saying, "This is so awful."

Cromwell Parliament's statue is the last memorial to the "history re-write"
It would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban against many British artifacts and religion made by the fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell's society describes Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said, "This can't be avoided in the current debate about the destruction of statues, that figure Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster's palace will be targeted.
The British brother war iconoclasm was neither ordered nor done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell offspring would be sacrificed for Thomas’ predecessors actions in the past century.
The outstanding representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft was a 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed to be worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a spokesman for parliament against outside pressure, in the case of the kingdom of course.
Whether it's a completely accurate representation, it's still a subject of the ongoing historical debate.
which is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the development of the next nation, and Cromwell is the one that can be identified as an individual representing one side of the difference.
His success is also worthy of celebration."
Killer Pigs Ending Chinese Farmers Until Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a southeast Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, who was identified only by the name of his trademark "Yuan", was found dead with severed arteries, covered in blood near a pig cage in the Liupanshui province market, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have gone with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, her cousin found her dead, and saw a pig's hole door near her was open.
He said that in the pig cage there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirmed that a male pig weighing 550 pounds has persecuted the farmer until he died, based on reports.
"My cousin's betis bleeds and breaks," said the cousin known as "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not from Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was already locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the authorities of the reported market are negotiating compensation for his death.
Though rare, cases of pig attack against humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts caused severe injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds grabbed an Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife was scared and banished from the animal.
After a farmer Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC News that pigs usually were not aggressive but the aroma of blood could act as "leaders".
"They're just playing games.
They're biters, very curious to know... they're not going out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's storm brings heavy rain to the west of the United States.
As expected, the storm of Rosa weakened as it moved on the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa would cause flooding throughout Mexico’s northern and western parts of the United States a few days later.
Rosa has a wind speed of 85 mph, Badai Kategori 1, starting at 5 a.m. on Sundays of the East Territory, and it is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa was likely heading north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Palung began to form on the Pacific Ocean and moved east, toward the West Coast of the U.S., when Rosa approached the border of the Low California on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push tropical moisture toward the north to the west of the U.S.
Rosa will bring rain up to 10 inches in part of Mexico’s territory on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture interacting with the approaching marsh will create the vast rains in the West Day for a few days to come.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause a dangerous bandage flood, a stream of debris and possibly longsighted soil in the desert.
Low tropical moisture will cause the temperature of the rain to close to 2 to 3 inches per hour at various points, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is estimated to fall in some parts of the West Day, especially in most Arizona.
The flood is likely to occur with a rapid deterioration of conditions because of the spread of tropical rains.
Very unlikely to explore the desert by walking because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause a flood to swell with violence and may carry a strong local wind and dust.
Close-up sticks will cause the local heavy rains to some of the South California shoreline.
Total rainstorms over half an inch are quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to be slippery.
It will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before it becomes wider on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will extend to four corners on Tuesday and survive to Wednesday.
In October, there will be some major changes in temperature across the U.S. when the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropical area remains quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes in the short distance.
There's an exact example of the dramatic temperature difference throughout the U.S. middle area on Sunday.
There was a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer’s warmth will be formed and renewed.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. regions are expected to start warm in October at a speed of 80s from the South Plain to the eastern parts of the sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate estimates show high chances of temperature above averages for the East U.S. until mid-October.
Over 20 million people have witnessed the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
Over 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by the court of Great Britain Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that was expected to happen in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, political collapse continues, with publishers organizing regular events to announce an unexpected event at the last minute of Friday: A deal developed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to investigate for a week on the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure that if Kavanaugh took her body drunk and tried to take off her clothes at the High High School.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
Probably over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company counts average viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Calculation for another network broadcasting this is not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often experienced difficulties in counting the number of people who watched him in the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the number of viewers that are almost the same as playoff football or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, who thinks the host is very supportive of the Kavanaugh show, superior of all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day's meeting, says Nielsen.
ABC holds second position with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Wanted to stay high after the trial.
Flake is a key event in the drama that Friday.
After the moderate Republican Party office issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being yelled at by a taste show when he tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee congregation.
He's standing down for a few minutes when he's being scrambled, broadcast directly at CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think that he told the country the truth?
He was told, "You have strength when there are many helpless women."'
Flake said that her office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he had to say in the committee.
Cable TV and the broadcast network all directly covered a few hours later, when the Justice Committee will choose to file the Kavanaugh call to the whole Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do that with the understanding that the FBI would examine the charges against the candidate for a week ahead, as the Democrat minority had asked.
Flake has been confirmed by some of the conversations with her friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
Pass the conversation with Coons and a couple of senators after that, Flake made her decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republic party won't have the voice to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accused Brexit's "political player" critic
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the criticism of playing politics with the future of Britain and damaging national interests, for his plan to get out of the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews showing him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed an attack on what he called a Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal about England and the EU that should raise a fee for each other is "the least of it doesn't make sense."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police caught Dyteon Simpson suspect in the death of the LSU player.
The police have caught a suspect on a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and jailed with a two-tier murder charge, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The officer released video confrontations between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his eyeglasses during the fight.
Police found the glass at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the stuff, WAFB CBS affiliation reported.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said that he had committed a fatal shooting at Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
Coroner's Eastern Baton Rouge parish office released a previous report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head to the neck.
The department is grateful for the urgent task of the Louisiana State Police Office, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police and the citizens around to assist in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement officer for "deservation and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
With 6,6 feet tall living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The average point he's 5.6 and he blew up to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said his team felt "broken" and "surprised" with Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," said Wade.
The volcano crushed ashes in the city of Mexico
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern region around the capital of Mexico.
National Disaster Prevention Center warns the Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the volcano after the activity is increased in the rice and registered there are 183 emissions of gas and ashes in a period of more than 24 hours.
The center was watching from a number of quiet, violent times.
Pictures on social media show a thin layer of ash hanging on the front of the car in the neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted the increase in activity on a volcano that is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
This Fire Mountain is known as "Don Goyo" that has been active since 1994.
Catalan's police are in foreclosures of independence elections.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a pro-freedom demonstration with anti-huru-hara police, and when thousands joined in a competition demonstration to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarization vote on self-absorbing.
A group of pro-separatic masks held by the anti-hurus Hara police threw them with eggs and threw powder paints, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would usually be filled by tourists.
The dispute also happened after that day with the police using their staff to control the dispute.
For a few hours pro-freedom groups shouting, "Don't forget, no forgiveness" faced by a union leader shouting, "Spanical life."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, the local press reported.
The tension remained high in this free-oriented region, one year after the referendum of 1 October that Madrid considered illegal but was celebrated by Catalan separatist.
The voters prefer to be free, although the low number of voters with those who oppose self-sustainment and most of them boycott elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote on the GST throughout the region in a fierce conflict.
Pro-freedom groups have camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separate protest with his wife said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's prospect of independence.
"Then we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out because they could choose, but now we're trapped," she said.
Although it has succeeded in achieving vital victory even a little in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-dependence parties have fought to maintain this year's momentum despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in exile or in custody awaiting trial, on their role in organizing the referendum and next declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded protests with his phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"This is getting more anxious," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned for pre-members since the end of last year, announced that he would run in the election of the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to address the decline in the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Gol printed by Menga has given victory to Livingston over Rangers with score 1-0
The first goal Dolly Menga for Livingston is to make sure the victory
Livingston's victory led the Rangers to fire Steven Gerrard from his position as the leader of the Hebox Club, for his defeat in 18 games.
The Dolly Menga attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt’s side moves in line with Hibernian’s second order.
Gerrard's side remains unreachable in this season's Premiership and facing the Hearts leader standing eight points in front of them, next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers gave you Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their invincible record in division into six games, while coach chief Holt still managed defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost a chance against a sloppy guest team
The Holt team should've been superior long before they scored the goal, with their accuracy giving the Rangers a variety of difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his efforts collapsed across the hawk's face, and then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after launching in and facing Craig Halkett's care from across the gang.
The host feels satisfied to let the Rangers play high in the beginning, knowing that they can harden a team of settlers over what happens to be a dead ball.
And that's how to make a very important goal.
Rangers free kicking and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in to help Menga, who got rounds and scored goals from the middle of the field.
At that point, the Rangers have dominated the rule but realize that the defense of the house cannot be breached and Liam Kelly's guitar is totally untiring,
The pattern continued until the second round, even though Alfredo Morelos managed to catch up with Kelly.
Scott Pittman was beheaded by the foot of the Rangers gawk Allan McGregor and Lithgow far out of the reach of another Livingston game.
The attack continues to come to the Livingston gaugge and constantly disappear, while two criminal claims--after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for the handball--rejected.
'Fenomale' from Livingston - analyses
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
The performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they are amazing, beyond hope on these constant routes.
Their style of playing and their personal has hardly changed since they returned to the top board, but the big credit has to be given to Holt over the way he has strengthened the team since he came.
He's got so much decoy.
Captain Halkett is very big, leading well organized defenses, while Menga keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall busy during the game.
Nevertheless, Rangers lack inspiration.
Whatever they did at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not good - only once they could break the formation of the side of the landlord - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan was welcomed to Cologne.
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
They disagreed about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkish entry to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
This city is home to the largest Turks population outside Turkey.
Police mention a security reason to block 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosques, but many supporters move around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan shells - many of them Kurds - also say, threaten both, Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in that country.
The resistance protest describes the opposition to the existence of a national hero whom some of the people of Germany have received and are being polled as a dictator by others.
Breaking down on the Deptford highway: The bike driver was killed in a car crash.
A bike driver died in a crash involving a car in London.
A collision took place near a third of the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The crash took place months after the other bikers died in a rundown on the Childsters Street, about a mile away from the Saturday crash.
Metropolitan police said that the officers were trying to identify the man and preach to his family.
The road closed and the bus route was taken and the drivers were taken to avoid the area.
Long Eastern Prison: Six of the officers injured in hara
Six men suffered injury in a man's prison riot with strict custody, the office declared.
The chaos occurred in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sundays and continues to run.
Specialist "Tornado" has been forced to deal with these concerns, involving eight prisoners and happening on one side of the building.
The officers were treated at the scene because of the slight wounds in the face.
One speaker said: "The specially trained lapes have been forced to deal with an incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison head was treated in a hospital after being assaulted by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, anti-hurus officers were called to prison to deal with serious complaints where an outlaw officer was attacked with biliary balls.
A Rosa storm threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with a Bandar Flood.
The tropical depression that hit Arizona rarely happens, but that's likely to happen early next week because of the remnant of Rosa's storm energy trail across the western desert, causing the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of a flood of flooding on Monday and Tuesday for the region of Arizona West to South Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa was expected to head straight past Phoenix on Tuesday, going to hit the night with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned in twitter that there are only ten tropical mice capable of generating tropical storms or depressed status in 200 miles of Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm in 40 miles of AZ border."
The latest storm power station can predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other western desert areas, including Rockies and Great Basin power stations, are likely to be hit 1 to 2 inches, with the possible number of isolations up to 4 inches.
For those in the free watering area, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because of the drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, part of the rainstorm is likely to be beneficial because the western region is currently in the process of drought.
According to the U.S. U.S. U.S. blackouts, only about 40 percent of Arizona's region has a slight extreme drought, the second highest category," reportedweather.com.
First, the route across Badai Rosa leads to the land across the California River in Mexico.
Rosa, still in the storm power on Sunday morning at the wind speed 85 miles an hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm met the colder waters of the Pacific, and for that reason it weakened its power.
Hence, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm power on Monday afternoon or evening.
High rainstorms may be high in parts of Mexico, risking high flooding
"Total rainstorms 3 to 6 inches are estimated to extend the Baja California region to the western region of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," reportedweather.com.
Then Rosa would cross the north throughout Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which would cross through Arizona and to southern Utah on mid-night.
"The main risk that may be caused by the Rosa storm or the rest of it is a very high rainstorm in Baja California, the western region of Sonora, and the U.S., the western territory of the U.S. desert." National Badai Center (NHC) states.
It is estimated that there will be a threat of floods and ruins that flow into the desert, and there will be a long-lasting land in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton: Arrest of four suspects attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a cough wound in Somerset.
The men's rhyme was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace Midsome Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in a "stabilistic" condition.
A 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - olds and a 20 - year - old man was arrested last night in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, says the police.
Officers have been cheering anyone who might have the video footage on his cell phone to come and report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘receives hatred and anger’ from the Democratic Party
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the cause of the cruel and shameful Democratic Party," said Trump at a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "receives hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the prosecution process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had been sexually violent to him for decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday, "The Americans see the intelligence and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"One vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to protest someone who has the most perfect legal thinking in our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he said to the West Virginia supporters crowd.
The President implicitly refers to Kavanaugh’s caliber as he talks about the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the mid-election.
"Five weeks before it happened one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really going," she said.
"That's why I went there, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argues that Democracy is on a mission to "fight and block."
The procedure of the first vote at the Senate level in the Kavanaugh call is expected to be carried out at the latest on Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed because of the Indonesian earthquake, the tsunami, with an increasing number of victims
At least 384 people died, many were dying when giant waves hit the shores, when earthquakes and tsunamis swept across the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the town of Palu on Friday when a sea of six feet [6 m] (18 ft) destroyed the beach at night, caused a lot of death and destroyed everything it had left behind.
Tsunami is followed by an earthquake of 7,5 power.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and not running away, so they were victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a speaker for the Disaster Relief Agency (BNPB) said at the time of suicide in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged the car, the wood, the house, covered everything in the land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before breaking the shoreline.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from tsunamis and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of service in the tree.
The BNPB’s air photograph shows many buildings and shops that were destroyed, a cornered bridge and an amber and a mosque surrounded by water.
The storms suddenly shook the city along the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes are reduced to 2.4 million people in the region.
The Research and Technology Enforcement Board (BPPT) said in one statement that energy emitted on the massive earthquake that Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb blast that was dropped in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geography of the city, which is at the edge of the narrow, can increase the size of the tsunami, can be said to be.
Nugroho describes the damage that happened as "extensive" and states that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of a ruined building, he said, adding that 540 victims were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be larger along the shoreline 300 km (190 miles) north of the Palu, a region called Dogalea, which was closer to the earth’s earthquake center.
The communication "was completely crippled with no information from Dogalea, says Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading toward a region that has a disaster impact.
"This is a tragedy, but it could be worse," she said.
The instance related on Saturday was much of a criticism because it did not inform the authorities that there was a long-lasting tsunami, although the authorities said that the wave had been suspended at the time of warning.
An amateur tape distributed on social media shows a man on the floor of a sounding building warning with panic that there will be a approaching tsunami, towards those on the street below.
Within minutes of the water flow of the beach, the building and the car are flooded.
Reuters can't immediately prove the accuracy of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunamis were the biggest cause of the electric blackout that transmitted communications around the Palu in order to make it difficult for authorities to coordinate efforts to save lives.
The military is already sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but refugees still need food and other needs.
The airport was reopened just to make efforts to reach its goal and to remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center of the Palu on Sunday.
The Indonesian Tsunami victim is rising above 800.
That's awful.
When World Vision officials from Dogalea have managed to survive in the town of Palu, where the officials sheltered in the purple tent that was built in their office yards, on their journey they have passed through various areas of perch, said Father Doseba.
"They told me that they've seen many houses destroyed," she said.
That's so terrible.
Even at the time the relief groups began to move slowly to start disaster relief activities, some of them complained about the lack of relief to skilled foreign volunteers, who were to go to the Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rules, the provision of supplies and energy from outside the country can only begin if the disaster area has been officially identified as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the time the government said, OKE, this is a national disaster," we could receive international help, but there was no such status."
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in the Palu, friends and family of the lost victims still hope that the people they love will be part of the miracle that will repair the natural disaster's wake.
On the Sabbath, a boy was kicked out of a puddle.
On Sunday, the rescuer took out a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's national paragliding team coach, has been a coach for two missing paragliding athletes, who managed to follow the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Father Mandagei, are his disciples.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how after news about the Roa-Roa Hotel that had been broken out around the paralysed community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who also participated in the celebration on the beach.
However, all the messages, only got one sign of gray belts, not two blue cents.
"I thought it meant the unsent message," he said.
The robber took $26,750 during the ATM filling in Newport in Levee

Anyone who has information about their identity can call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
West Kanye: That Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
She announced a change in her name over Twitter on Saturday, and she wrote: "It was once formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, already has Ye's name for some time and uses it as its eighth album title, released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to write his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to perform at the show, which was cancelled because of "emotional reasons," said the show creator.
As a short for his current professional name, West had previously said that to him that word had religious significance.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You,' said West earlier this year, to discuss the album title with the publisher of Big Boy Radio.
"So I am you, I am us, that name is us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to become Ye-- as a mirror of our goodness, our bad, our confusion, all.
The album is more of our true mind."
He's one of a number of rappers that changed their names.
Sean Combs in various ways has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
Former collaborator West, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of connections and letters.
President of Mexico, AMLO, I swear not to use the military in the face of civil society
President chosen Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had sworn that he would never use military power against the civil society by warning the 50th year of the bloody retaliation against the student.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military power to push the Mexicans."
The troops launched fire on peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when the left wing students movement planted their roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those in college and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity for education have led young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the A.I.
Since China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funds that will be used for research in the field, said investors and A2 Kai-Fu Lee practice, which has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Commentary came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. was in complete lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: to become number 1 in the 2030 innovation.
"Overall AI funding is a good start, since all other countries tend to stay away from the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
Cross-funding could double the opportunity so that the next major AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, the owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed the AI system that defeated the best American Othello player, and after that he became an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of Google branch China.
Lee admitted the competition of the U.S. government technology earlier as a Robotic Challenge for the Final Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win the government's prize, Lee says.
"It's not China that takes the lead in academics; it's a company," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring high-tech professionals from the university for research in the past few years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. to support a round of AI efforts.
"I think the green card can be offered automatically to the PHD-header in the AI," he said.
China's National Council issued its next Generation Design Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions the same way as the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations that distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year in the U.S. Defense Department developed a Joint Building Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industrial partners and academics, and the White House authorities announced the formation of the Selection Committee for Writing Intelligence.
And in this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSFs, DARPA recently invested over $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that called for the establishment of the National Security Commission for the Intelligence of the Forest did not see any further action for months.
Macedonians do a vote in order to change the country's name
The Macedonians made a vote on Sunday to decide the change of the country's name to be "the North Macedonian Republic," an action that would resolve conflicts for a decade with Greece that had challenged its membership offer to be part of the Union of Europe and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the view that the name of its neighbouring country represents confession of ownership of its territory and has prohibited its joining with NATO and the European Union.
Both governments reached the agreement in June based on the new name submitted, but nationalist opposition argued that change would damage the identity of most of Slavia Makedonia's ethnic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't give his voice to the general election and a boycott campaign has raised the doubt that the election results could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the votes needed to ensure that the election results were stated.
The question is: "Did you approve of NATO and the EU by accepting any agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to get permission to enter the body like the Union of Europe and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the younger generations of Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally bound, quite a number of members of parliament say they will obey the results of voting in order to make decisions.
Name changes require two to three votes in parliament.
The state election committee says there's no breach report until 1 p.m.
However, it turned out that the result of the vote was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last elections in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters gave their voice mail.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a picker in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice to the Macedonian general election in order to change the name of the country that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov has already set up a small stage and pulled seats in front of the tents made by those who are going to boycott the voter.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join in honorably, not through the waiter door," said Kavarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more required investment for Macedonia, which had a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe most people will agree with it because over 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving the vote.
He said "yes" would be "confirming our future."
A review published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday states that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the vote - less than what is needed.
Another poll, hosted by Telma Makedonia TV station, found 57 percent of respondents planning to join their voices on Sundays.
Of them, 70 percent said they'd choose yes.
To be successful, it takes 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure in voting will represent the rejection of the first policy against the pro-Barat government since taking over in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City explored all of Brighton's defenses to score goals.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling was forced into Brighton defense on Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the victory look very easy on his score in the minutes to 65.
Argentine attackers received an opin in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three men defending Brighton, before he got into the open field.
Aguero then discovered himself surrounded by four green-eyed men.
He turned past one man defends before running ahead of some other people at the edge of the Brighton gulf.
Then he operated on his left, to Sterling.
Britain's front twinkling took its first kick from the gawag to blow the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's kiper, Mathew Ryan with a kick on the right side of the gaung.
"Aguero was struggling with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola, the city manager to the reporter.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
Sure enough, the young Bethelites have befriended Jacob.
We're glad he scored a goal at that time."
But Sterling gave Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
It happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a ball, far into Brighton's territory on that game.
He's working ball with a far kick that goes through the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Sane did a bit of a ball before he led Sterling to a remote post.

Scherzer wanted to join spoiler versus Rockies
With the elimination of the Nationals of the playoff game, there's no reason to force another match.
But Scherzer, who is too competitive, is hoping to take over Colorado Rockies at the game on Sunday, but only if there's still playoff involvement for Rockies, which is superior in one match over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies have not found the most after winning a wild-card match against Nationals with score 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division title.
"Even if we play without winning, at least we can find out the atmosphere in Denver with a crowd of audiences and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a fight?"
Nationals have not announced the opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer fight.
Scherzer, who will start a strike for 34 times, holds a training session on Thursday and starts a Sunday game that is usually used to rest.
Washington's right-hand picker is 18-7 scorer with average run (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 inning this session.
Trump's campaigning in West Virginia.
The President himself refers to a situation in which the High Court has a choice, Brett Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of the public opinion of the Republic in the middle of the election.
"All the efforts we've done are at stake in November.
Five weeks before the election is the most important one in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I fight all over the place for extraordinary candidates," he said.
Trump continues, "You see there's a very-excellent radical democracy group, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you see the crime, their cruelty.
They do not care who they hurt.
Democracy, he said, is on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you saw it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrath and evil and vile and untrustworthy."
He referred to the Senate of Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Court Committee, by referring to her name, which was closely addressed by her listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, I'm waiting for him-- it's a very bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labor Force Party is no longer a public service site.
Now being intolerant with anyone who is raising his mind
When Momentum's activist at the local party I gave a voice to mock me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I was in the last sequence of Parliamentary Members, who were told that our presence was not expected because we expressed our views.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan got a similar treatment because he defended anti-Semitism firmly.
In my case, it criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, the ironic issue that Jeremy Corbyn opposed to earlier leaders.
The announcement for the meeting of the workers of the Eastern Nottingham on Friday states that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on that Friday night was exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about "better, more friendly" politics is not long forgotten, if, indeed, it has ever begun.
Opinions in the labor party are more clearly not tolerated and each opinion is judged by the party's authority.
It began immediately after Jeremy became a leader, as a colleague I thought I would be able to share the same political view, starting to expect me to turn around and accept the position I would never have received before - either in national security or in the single European market.
Whenever I speak openly--and no matter what I say--then after that there will be a search in social media that calls for an adjournment, attacks the central politics, telling me I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just me.
Of course, I know that I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleague who has faced sexual harassment or racism every day but never let go.
One of the most disappointing aspects of today's political era is how much abuse has been considered natural.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should help develop culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer in larger churches and with every motion "unbelievable" or transforming the selection of party rules becomes more limited.
I got a lot of advice for two years ago that pushed me to keep my head down, not too much voice, and then I'm gonna say, "Okay."
But I fell into politics, not to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by the construction of Thatcher government, which resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsed, I have been trying to fight better public service for those who greatly need it - as local advisors and ministers in government.
I had never hidden my political action, including in my last election.
No one in the Nottingham East will question my policy position and things that I do not agree with today's leadership.
For those who encourage the move on Friday, what I can say is that when the country moves fast towards the division of sovereignty (Brexit), it will endanger our state and public service business, I don't want to waste time and energy for loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, as a member of the Labour Party or not.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr ascended to the top
The last two attempts may have been a little misleading, but no doubt Ayr deserves to win the tennent's Premiership game that is very comforting today.
Now they're in the top order, the only side that's unbeatable from ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, and the ability to achieve the best opportunity, which made the host team and coach Peter Murchie have the right to be happy.
"So far we've been testing our game, and we're still invincible so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The appreciation for Ayr, they're better at taking a chance than we do."
The experiment Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in front of it, but the yellow card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given at the game by Warriors, gave the opportunity for Melrose to print numbers and Jason Baggot to rob an unconverted experiment.
The climate softened Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of time, he scored a goal and then did a single experiment to make Ayr's score 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and the experiment of Patrick Anderson, which was changed by Baggot, reduced the opportunity to five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruaidh Knott had a serious wound, was held out, and since the start of the fight, Ayr went on faster than the Stafford McDowall experiment, modified by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then struck with yellow cards and again, Melrose made a spare player pay with an unaltered Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of the hard stress.
Mr. Home has been back to play, but at the time St. Hutchinson got a yellow card because he slipped Climo without a ball, from the penal line, MacPherson arrived behind Ayr's advanced wounded.
Clima was replaced, as is the case again, almost from the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe made a gawk kick and disrupted the fifth effort of Gregor Henry's operator.
Still Game Star looks ready for his new career in the restaurant industry
The Star Still Game Kieran looks ready to move to the service industry after it was known that he was renamed as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis performs a BBC popular event, which is hosted and also hosted by an old comedian, Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the nine series that will come is the final episode, and Kiernan appears to be planning to drive the broadcasts right after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's the director of the Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refuses to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun narrative indicates that Kiernan is trying to get involved in the "growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours: Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hoping that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific.
The sailors perform patrols at the headquarters of the large seamen in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Navy Camp from Titicaca to Amazon is powered by a motorcycle: "The sea is our legal right.
To rise back is a duty."
Passing through Bolivia surrounded by land, the memories of the defeat of a coast line to Chile in a 19th - century bloody conflict are still clear - as the desire to return to the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a court ruling on October 1 after a five - year election.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will watch the ICJ trial across the country, hope that the court in Den Haag will support Bolivia’s claim that - after decades of insurgency - Chile is obliged to negotiate the guarantee of Bolivia’s sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the Bolivian president who is charismatic about the controversial war for next year's election - also has a lot of support for the trial on Monday.
"We've been very close to the return of the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court cannot decide Bolivia's wishes - and that would only change a little if it were possible.
The Netherlands based on the United Nations body does not have the power to hand over the Chilean territory, and it has already decided that it will not decide the outcome of the possible negotiations.
That the ICJ statement comes only six months after the final argument that has been heard, which indicates that the case is "uncomplex," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law officer.
And still a long way from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years, it's probably a decline.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the good ictikad of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at a certain point will remain at odds, but it will be very difficult to keep the discussion after this.
Both countries have not changed their ambassadorial status since 1962.
Former president of Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s vice president of Den Haag, quickly rejected the decision.
Monday will give Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to open up an era of relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disputes with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-but one of the most famous Latin American presidents used the maritime issue as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never relinquish her right to have access to the Pacific," she added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see what we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons are not going to happen unless they can trust the U.S.
Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never remove nuclear weapons if Korea couldn't trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned the United States to carry out a deal that was made at a meeting between competing leaders in Singapore.
The comment appeared when the Secretary of the State of the U.S. Mike Pompeo appeared almost starting a nuclear diplomacy that had been destroyed for more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri said only a "one dream" that continuing the sanctions and rejection of the U.S. against the declaration of a Korean War settlement would make North Korea surrender.
Washington is alert to agree to that declaration without any Pyongyang making efforts to detain the armed forces first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to hold a second meeting.
But there's a doubt that Pyongyang is absolutely about the confession of the weapons warehouse that the country has become the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris fashion show shows a lot of the latest collection closing heads to the main road near you
If you want to increase the collection of hats or really want to protect yourself from sunlight don't find anything else.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers released a series of big-size cap caps for their SS19 collection on stage fashion shows with a fashionable style held in Paris Fashion Week.
The truly impractical hats have wiped out Instagram this summer and these designers have been showing creations that blind their eyes on the sports stage.
The highlight of Valentino is a krem-colored hat on which it is adorned with the width of the fur tray covering the head of the model.
Large sized accessories include a pair of diamonds, witches ’ hats, and even a pineapple, but not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange mask group-and right through Halloween.
A lot of colorful masks whose lips have been sewn up and look like Hannibal Lecter compared to high couture.
A creation that resembles an ensemble of snorkels and glass, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep looking at the collection of that wide mode-- then you're being flattered.
Fashion watchers estimate that the big hat collection will be placed on the main road near you.
Big-size hats became a very fast train in La Bomba, straw hats with a width of two feet visible used all including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The praise of the label behind a hat that is very impractical of social media makes a big creation in the seacaps of the large straw - almost the same as the swimwear - used with a cellular model.
The brandy bag that was burned, carved with raisin on the edge with white straps, is an outstanding thing from the collection Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrities writer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see a big hat and a beach bag arriving on the main road for the next summer--because the designer has made a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for that big accessory'
John Edward: Language skills are important to global citizens
Scotland's private school keeps track of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with outstanding test results, which are being strengthened by each student and collective success in sports, art, music and hard work.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish School Council (SCIS) work hard to provide the best services for students and parents.
The school aims to prepare its students for higher and higher education, their careers, and their role as citizens of the world.
As the education sector that can design and implement the school curriculum as expected, we see modern languages continue to be the subjects of popular choice and want in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in the language he understands, you'll get into his head.
If you speak to him in his language then you will enter his heart."
It's a strong reminder that we can't just rely on the English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the recent test this year, we can see that language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation in the primary school.
Total 68 percent of students who learn foreign language get A Plus.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools that showed that 72 percent of students get A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them learned German, 69 percent of them learned French and 63 percent learned Spanish also got A.
This indicates that the primary school in Scotland supports the foreign language as an important skill that children and young people will certainly need in the near future.
Currently, the language, as an eye-catcher option, is held in the same standard as the STEM study (scientists, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Engineering and Skills Service in 2014 found that of some reasons why workers had to keep fighting to fill the openings, 17 percent why the lack of language skills was.
Thus, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their careers in time to come.
As the opportunities for more and more language skills increase, this skill becomes important in today’s world.
Whatever career choices a person may choose, if they have learned the second language, in the future they will have real benefit because of having the skills of this kind of life.
It is possible to communicate directly with the citizens of a foreign country, and it will automatically result in a high-ranking multilingual in competition.
According to the opinion of YouGov in over 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak foreign language with good enough to make French the only language spoken in two digits, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning for children today is important for now.
Having multilingual skills, especially the language of countries with a growing economy, will divide children with a better opportunity to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the most important language in England for the next few years, or 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected in the private school, with a staff of teachers in this field.
The Scottish School is designed to provide the learning environment that will prepare the children and divide them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be surpassed that at present, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
The school will continue to offer options, conveniences, and excellence to Scotland’s teenagers.
We have to do it.

However, it has not been determined how many minutes he will play.
"It's more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote tweet that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plan for the six-time Lakers competitions.
"At the stage of my career right now, I don't have to do the season games to get ready," he said.
Public Trump Updates in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a public campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first public meeting of the five public meetings scheduled for next week, including a stop in some lovely places covering Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was stated that the vote was suspended in order for him to choose the position of the Supreme Court, Trump intended to build support for him for the forthcoming public election of part time because the Republican Party risked losing control of Congress if the vote was taken on November.
What time is Trump's public meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia scheduled for 7 p.m. and tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's public meeting in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's meeting for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which is becoming more tense after the accusation of unexplained sexual action and the estimates of the Senate's scrutinizing will be delayed until a week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main purpose of this general agenda meeting is to help the Republic's party get some momentum in facing the November general election.
Therefore, in the campaign President Trump mentioned that five public meetings this week are intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters because the Republican party is trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the DPR," Reuters said.
"Conference control is very important to his agenda so the president will probably travel to the countries during our busy campaign season," the Trump campaign speaker who refused to mention his name conveying to Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling, the public meeting tonight is expected to provide supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attracting the linguists from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state that he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump's trying to help Patrick Morrisey, candidate of the West Virginia Senate of the Republic Party who was left behind in the polls.
"Not a good sign for Morrisey so the president should come as an effort to increase his opinion," said Simon Haeder, a politician at Western Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team bravery holds his hope in face of a single Sunday game
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome session is probably required in this Ryder Cup.
The swing of the momentum band is a sport concept that is the result of a fully trusted discovery by the players, and there is nothing greater than in this competition.
Where do they think the moment is right now?
"Before, they're up six points and now four, so I think we consider it a little moment," said Jordan Spieth as he passed that day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of being superior to four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had a little momentum and they had a lot of things that could be spirit, no exception to the formations of Spieth and Justin Thomas that played together all day and each one was proud of three of four points.
Spieth has played deadlyly from the tea area to the green area and led with caution.
Screaming that giant celebrity is getting tougher as his turn comes, doing a big kick to make a series game when he and Thomas lose two against two.
The punching of her who won them on the 15th that was greeted with a similar shout, a scream that told you that she was sure America didn't lose.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes to mark.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days ago was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unproven story from Ryder Cup.
The unique but interesting couple from Europe are four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the boyy on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and back Monday mornings.
It's the run, and how their energy seems to flow both to and from this tedious crowd that convinces that they're the players to be defeated on Sundays, and there's no player more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari who will lock up Europe's potential for victory at sunset on Le Golf National.
It's better if at the same time they're both placed in a different hole.
Still, it is too early to speak of European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson increased the work of Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero in the morning, when he was installed with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front of the nine like digging holes that can never be set up by the Spanish golfer and this Sweden.
Even though, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and antsome are a good show to be seen closer because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategies can change at once.
So far, Europe plays better as a team and leads far enough to the final day, but also the antsome sessions show that the U.S. team has the nerve to compete even though some parties doubted, especially in the United States.
Top Europe 10-6 on the last day Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the final day Ryder Cup after the rise of the four-ball and antsomes of Saturdays with leading 10-6 over the United States.
The duo that inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over Tiger Woods who had to fight to record their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to maintain an unproven trofi in Hazeltine two years ago, dominating the U.S. team on the wrong target in the morning fourball, making this serial result to be 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in antsome, won two matches, but they could not reduce deficits.
The Jim Furyk team needs eight points out of 12 single day competitions on Sundays to maintain trophys.
Fleetwood is the first European debut to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after the end of the sensational week, are just a second couple who win four points of their four openings in the Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs they became very strong to defeat Woods that slammed and debuted America Bryson Dechambeau with a stronger 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturdays, once a brilliant performance, has lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rest in the morning fourball, then go back to pair with Henrik Stenson in antsome and lose 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - rank one and three worlds.
Europe did not reach itself even though the day was pleasant and winding in the west of Paris.
The main winner of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas three times decreed that the U.S. belittle it by two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 win that was exciting for Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball and then back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in antsome after losing two first holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history where a team back from the deficit four points entered a single game, even though as the champion of the Furyk team only needed serial points to maintain the trofi.
However, after becoming the best of the second for two days, the Sunday attack seemed to be going beyond them.
North Korea says 'unpossible' will take out weapons on one side without any trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations about the ongoing sanctions against the United States of America, and it was unlikely that the country would shed its nuclear weapons on its own alone in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Council that North Korea had taken "significant steps to show good intentions" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, overturning the location of nuclear testing, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"No, we don't see any appropriate responses from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we can't afford to disarm our own weapons on our own first hand."
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance in the "supply" approach to the settlement where North Korea would be punished for taking steps in the first place, his statement pointed out that they did not reject fully as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit meeting between the president of the United States and the new North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, at that time, Kim promised to make an effort to "conclude the Korean side" while Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has officially wanted the end of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States says that Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused the call to extend heavy international sanctions to North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first registration" and increases pressure with the spring sanctions to reach their goal in force, and even rejects the "declaration of the end of the war," by Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us scold our knees is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is the constant sanction that will deepen our disbelief."
Ri didn't mention a plan for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, escorted the U.S. leader of the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister also endorsed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the problemrs in this research are South Korea and not the United States, there's no way to find this kind of dead end."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he spoke to the U.N. General Congregation that targeting North Korea rockets on the United States was something that could not be avoided after "Lord President Devil" Trump called Kim "man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN meeting, Trump, a year ago threatened to "break up" North Korea in total, to praise Kim for her courage to take steps to disintegrate, but the big job still has to be done and sanctions must remain done until North Korea's doubling.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - no problem," he said.
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council must punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the Foreign Minister of the United States, Mike Pompeo, told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue with firmness and must not fail until we know that full, final and verified disclosure."
Security Council with a round voice increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop nuclear program and Pyongyang ballistic missile.
Pompeo met Ri in the wake of the UN General Assembly and said after that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip is not going well.
He left Pyongyang in the month of July saying that there has actually been progress, just North Korea in the stormy hour count that he made "demand like gangster."
North Korea promises in a meeting with Moon this month to unload the missile site and also nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate steps."
He stated that Kim told him to do the "appropriate remedy" with his wish is a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalization of relations with Washington.
High Harvard students take a course on enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year made all S1 students sleep more, in an effort to fight macho culture in learning that is developing through the 'man of ghost birds' of caffeine.
An academic discovered that students at the university number one world often don't know anything when it comes to very basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a medical professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course, which he believed was the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleepless studies.
'In the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why did I just be told now, in my final year?'
She said that no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping - which surprised me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The course launched the first time this year, explaining to students about the essence of how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic results, and improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and an executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a student who was very poor in bed all week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there are images of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation about the influence of caffeine and light, and how athletic results are influenced by a lack of sleep, and the importance of routine sleeptime.
On the other hand, the patient gets an explanation of how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A college map, with interactive icons, then stimulates the participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change student behavior instantly.
But we're sure that they have the right to know - as you have the right to know the effect of choosing to suck cigarettes on health,' fed Prof. Czeisler.
The culture is proud of the 'manufacturer' still exists, to the point of addition to modern technology and the pressure that continues to increase in students, which means that sleep deprivation is a problem that continues to develop.
To ensure you sleep enough, with good quality, must be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, the pain - even to avoid adding weight, because lack of sleep makes the brain activates the mode of hunger, triggers the constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old resident in California who studied chemistry and physical biology that helped Professor Czeisler design the course, took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize the course for the entire college.
The next step, he hoped that the entire university student would be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider regulating the time-to-night alarm, also wake up alarm, and realize the effect of the blue light emitted by the electronic screen and LED lights, which can slow your circular rhythm out of the course so as to cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga degrades mental forces Gerrard
Again, Rangers felt the sadness of the bitter day of the Dolly Menga attack delivering Steven Gerrard's team that was buried in the 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Hebox team tried to record their first victory on their journey, since the 4-1 victory in February at St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team had just given second defeat for Gerrard in 18 games as managers, causing his team to be left eight points by the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
The attack was seven minutes before the first round was over and the unreasonable Rangers didn't appear to be embalming.
While Rangers are now down to the sixth position, Livingston goes up to the third position, only one goal left of Hibernian.
And there could be more problems in Rangers' grave after Calum Spence's line guard should be treated because of a head wound after an object is thrown out of the distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on the Ayr-fly team to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with the costumes that surrounded their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the possession of the ball, but Livingston uses the ball they own better.
They should've recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bait was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's cage, but it attracted that big opportunity too wide.
A free shot of Jacobs's a deep one met Captain Craig Halkett but his fellow defense Alan Lithgow could only stab wide in the back position.
Rangers take control but there seems to be more hope than belief about their game at the third end.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should have been penalized when he and Steven Lawless crashed on a quarter-hour mark but left Steven Thomson refusing to speak out to the Colombians.
Rangers only managed to do two throws in the first round but the previous Ibox guard, Liam Kelly, hardly ever had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's headaches and easy-to-quite Ovie Ejaria's attack.
Although Livi's opening goal at the 34th minute may be opposed to the way for the game, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with a deep Jacobs dead ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for the simple end.
Gerrard acted at a break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and that replacement almost affected the direct effect when the wingman put a ball on Morelos but Kelly played impressively quickly out of the line to stammer.
But Livingston continues to force the team to play exactly the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett wiped out all the balls.
The Holt team should extend their excellence at the end but McGregor stood up well to throw Jacobs away before Lithgow floated wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement player, Glenn Middleton, claimed penalty again when he disagreed with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face away.
Almanac: Geiger Breaker
And now from our German "Sunday Morning" page: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and the MASH will be on the move... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed methods to detect and measure radioactivity, which was a discovery that finally made the device called Geiger Breaker.
Being a science-based tool ever since, Geiger's breaker has also become the root of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," identified cowboy scientists who seem to be less convinced of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Breaker, used to find a radioactive mineral location, like uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of the atom released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, it's gonna come up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But that discovery kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune systems to "know" evil cells
New cancer vaccine teaches immune systems to 'know' evil cells and kill them
Vaccines teach an immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from patients, converting them to laboratory.
They can then 'know' a common protein in many cancers and then inject it again.
A trial vaccine shows promising results for patients with various types of cancer.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which teaches an immune system to recognize evil cells, her ovaries were missing for more than 18 months.
This method involves the extraction of the patient's immune cells, converting them into the laboratory so that they can "know" the proteins that are generally present in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cell back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the United States National Cancer Society in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "It's true that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "grows some kind of cancer," including breast cancer, ovary, lung, and colorectal, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
The same approach as taking immune cells and "teaching" to them how to target cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West started Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing MAGA hats, after his SNL appearance.
Is Not Walking Good
Kanye West was muttered at the studio during Saturday Night Live after performing the messy show where he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said that he was going to run himself in 2020.
After bringing in the third song that night, called Ghost Town where he wore the Big American hat, he challenged the Democratic party and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How come you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL starts a show with a charade Matt Damon where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about the claim of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcasted, the tapes of the Western worms were posted to social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock's trying to make fun of West with that bullshit.
Moreover, West complains to the audience that he has had difficulty behind the stage because of the hat that was worn.
"They're slamming me behind stage.
They said, 'don't go out wearing that hat.'
They're falling for me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "You want to see a drowning place?" said that he would wear Superman's clothing, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
The comment produced at least twice the audience and the SNL appear to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person saying, "A whole studio is closed."
West was brought in at the last moments as a substitute for Ariana Grande, former rap singer friend Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confuses many people with the appearance of I Love it, dressed like the Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservation group, Candace Turner who wrote tweet: "For one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU HAVE BEEN AWAY."
But Karen Hunter's host wrote tweets that West is just "become himself and it's really very good."
"But I choose not to provide someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) that I believe is dwindling and driving dangerous ideology to my community.
He's free.
So do we," more.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "a creature who is officially known as Kanye West."
She's not the first artist to change her name and follow Diddy's trail, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
As a rap singer, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and certainly the legend of Prince's music, turning his name into a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Attempts to kill inhale at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with an attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

Firefighters are expected to be present in front of the Belfast National Court on Monday.
This charge will be examined by the Attorney General.
The Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticizes poisonous masculineness
Kit Harington is famous for swinging swords in his role as Jon Snow in the Middle Century fantasy series full of violence from HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, with stereotypes of macho heroes, said that the role on the screen is often made the teenagers feel that they must be strong to be respected.
Talk to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says that he's convinced he's wrong and questioning how to handle a bad masculine problem in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who just married his opponent at Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, confessed he felt 'strong enough' to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, strong enough, now--where is our fault in this masculine thing?' she said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, related to the problems we see now?'
The kit believes that television may be responsible for the appearance of bad masculineness with its very masculine character.
He goes on to say: 'Where is the character from birth, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, which makes boys feel that they should have this particular side to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of this time-- how do we change it?
Because obviously there's something wrong with the young men.'
In that interview he also admitted that he would not play in precruel or sequele Game of Thrones when this series would end in the coming summer, saying that he had been 'selected with the field of war and horses'.
Since November Kit will rescind the True West from Sam Shepard, which is a story about his film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so give me the future family, and from here my life begins' her speech.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit character, Jon Snow, in this Emmy award-winning series.
This couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% of the new cases
China has announced 14% of its people living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people in this country, said health officer.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of Tiokok as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, the health officer of Tiokok says at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community in Tiokok.
Homosexuality was decriminized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT people was called more and more marak.
Because of the conservative value of this country, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many infectious diseases are derived from improper sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of the effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters objected that the staff had leaked the senator's GOP data, spread 'a dangerous lie' and 'conspiracy theory'
The Maxine Waters representative on Saturday objected that one of his staff members had sent personal information to three senators of the United States Republic Party to the Wikipedia page of parliament.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserts that the claim was moved by experts and websites "ultra-right Wing".
"The lies, the lies, and many more the dirty lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the information released includes the home address and phone number of the U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by an unknown man in Capitol Hill during the Senate panel meeting on the charge of unsound sexual behaviour against the court-mart Brett Kavanaugh.
This bocoran appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the shipment is connected to the Waters office and revealing information of one of the Waters staff members, Hill reported.
"This claim isn't entirely wrong and it's an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member--identity, personal information, and safety are threatened by the false and false accusations that are not responsible for this information leak.
This claim is not entirely wrong and is a lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracts criticism of the online, including the ex-Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This mess means anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be a Congressman.
If a person is accused of something he does not do, he should not be offended.
They must not stray.
They should not question the motives of the conjurer.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday congregation.
Omar Navarro, the candidate of the Republic party who was trying to move Waters on the second-hand election, also conveys his thinking on Twitter.
"Even if you're right," she wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office has warned "right authority and the law enforcement entity about this wrong charge.
"We'll make sure that the perpetrator will be exposed," further, "and they'll be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to one and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - bad spy parody Rowan Atkinson
Now looking for Brexit's significance in every new film with English biases has become a tradition and it seems to apply to the re-emergence of the paralabad parádios Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the syndicate sarcasm be about how bad we are to be a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English, whose eyes are twisted, whose face is rubber, and his lack of competence has renewed his license to mess up everything for the second time - his name gives more guidance than anything that he is a vast comical creation designed for the realm of English - speaking cinema.
Of course, he's a crazy secret agent who, out of his strange guess, has a little clouseau character, like Mr Bean's character and a traveling helmsman who contributed a little note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony London 2012.
Indeed, he is based on international mysterious guides and men who were once played at Atkinson on the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving the mess behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on this latest JE trip.
I love it when Johnny English approached a helicopter with mid-century collars and rotor swings quickly stuck on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy was shown, but his humor was less powerful and too strange, especially when branding a "serious" film like 007 and Mission Couldn't believe himself to put comedians as a material.
It feels like it's meant for children rather than adults, and for me it's a strange Johnny English that's not innovative and focused on Atkinson film jokes in Bean's personality.
A prize that's been warm for years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, uncovering the identity of all British agents in the field, to disappoint an official agent -- unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the proud and hostile prime minister, who has completely destroyed his population politically: Emma Thompson played very well with almost-Teresa-May characters but not much of the script.
The intelligent advisor gives information that because every active spy has been crushed, he has to bring someone out of retirement time.
And that means Johnny English's cousin himself, now employed as head of school in some fancy buildings, but giving a secret lesson on how to perform the undercover operation: there are some nice jokes here, when English offers a spy academy like School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency briefings and rejoined with old friends who had been suffering from Bough, being seen by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, instigating a submarine commander, the high-class role of the high-class woman who sucks where Vicki Pepperdine is kind of out of her mind.
So Batman and Robin made a mistake on His Majesty's Secret Agent back in action, met a beautiful mystery Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is worriedly falling into the influence of a million millionaire charismatic technology that claims can solve the problem of English computers: the bad Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their silly adventure: disguised as a waiter, they burned the French fast-sacrifice restaurant; they made a mess by smuggled themselves onto the luxury ships of Volta; and English triggered anarchy when he tried to use the headsset Virtual Reality to get used to the inside of the Volta house.
All arrests must have been pulled for the last sequence, but with hospitality and such cares, there's a few children's TV channels that contain all about everything.
It's pretty moderate.
And like any other Johnny English film, I can't think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
The workers objected to planning for the British to be able to work four days a week but paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Union considered a radical plan that wanted the British to work four days a week - but was paid five days.
It is reported that the owners of the company continue to reap results through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for the workers by giving them additional holidays.
He'll let the employees enjoy the weekend of three days - but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that these ideas will be 'pass' with the party's economic agenda and plans push the country to support workers.
A four-day transition has been approved by the British Congress of Dagang as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
One source, the senior of the Labour Union, told The Sunday Times: 'This policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This is not going to happen overnight, but four days a week's work is a reasonable aspiration with party approach to re-establishing the economy that supports the workers and industry strategies of the party as a whole.'
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, because the Green Party has promised four days of work in a week at the 2017 public election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
Mentioners say: 'Every day in a week's work is not party policy and is not being considered by the parties.'
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to perfect his vision for a social revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "anonymous directors" and "catutists" in the utility company.
The plan of this shadow canister also means that the current shareholders of the drinking water company may not be able to get back the whole stock because the government of the Manga Party can do the 'adjustment' on the grounds of a perceived violation.
He also made sure that his plan to put workers in the company council and created the Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, who would rely on annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his prosecution at the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question whether the findings of this office might affect the senators of the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In the interview shown on Sunday, the correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Senator of the Republican Party, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find something that could make them change their mind.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his South Carolina partner.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charges appeared, and said, 'You did it?'
He's a firm, firm, firm man."
However, Graham’s voice could not seem to be changed.
"My mind has made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is: Brett's fighting him hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he calls can't verify his name.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What does the Global Citizen Festival mean, and what this event has done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that shows the star-rights that are very impressive, and the mission that is also effective; ending the world's poverty.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the actions of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the purpose of this event which was to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, was the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hoped to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fought against poverty.
To get free tickets for the event (except you want to pay VIP tickets), concert guests have to complete a series of tasks or "actions" like volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, calling, or other ways that mean helping raise awareness of the purpose of their end of poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in reaching its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a gift is the right way to invite people to do something, or just another case called "clickivism" -- people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, prompting them to set other goals.
It has been said that this action has helped trigger world leaders to announce the equivalent commitment and policy of more than $37 billion that would affect more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group had gathered 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of which had been delegated or funded.
This group estimates that the security fund so far has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
A number of major commitments among others: The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership composed of investors and perpetrators committed to "help the children grow to their maximum potential," promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the lack of nutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, the miners, the national governments, and the Global Citizen like you, we can make social injustice about this deficiency a history record," Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told the crowd at the direct concert in London in April 2018.
This group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to raise nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions in the General Questions on their websites that asked "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global scientist answers: "It's going to be a long, hard way--sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But just like the civil rights movement and the great anti-apartheids that were before us, we'll make it, because if we get together, we'll get stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the stars that are performing this year's show in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "block" to prevent the export of Russian energy - Secretary in the Country
"If necessary" Washington could call for help from the Navy to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary, Ryan Zinke revealed, as stated by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly believes that Russia’s involvement in Syria - in particular, where it operates on a legitimate government invitation - is a turning point for exploring a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be an energy maker, just as they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure the open seaway, and, if necessary, to do the blockade, to make sure that their energy can't get into the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the events held by Aliansi Energi Consumen, a group of nillaba who called himself "an energy customer's voice" in the U.S.
He compared Washington's approach in a deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they are the same.
"Economic choices in Iran and Russia are less, exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with the economy that depends on fossil fuel.
This statement appeared when Trump's government representative was doing a mission in order to increase their natural gas exports to Europe, instead of Russia, a much cheaper choice for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including the US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull away from the North Stream 2 "undeserved" oil pipeline project, which Trump says, made Berlin the "conservation" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Northern Stream 2 oil mill project is worth $11 billion, designed to double the capacity of the oil mill pipe that is up to 110 billion cubic feet of this, is pure economic project.
Kremlin objected that Washington's tough opposition to this project was merely motivated by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy can't be made to exert pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US leadership has attracted reactions from Germany, which has reconfirmed their commitment to this project.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in the energy policy of the European Union and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face big problems if the third country mixes our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren would "see the situation" when he called himself President in 2020, said Senator Massachusetts.
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he would "see the situation" while running as president after a part-time election.
While camping in the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren emphasized that he would consider running himself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, including putting women in the top position," as they say to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'll reflect the situation when I run as president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when he was campaigning in the city hall, saying that he "takes this area in the wrong direction.
"I was very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren blancs in delivering his criticism of Trump and the ruling Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we make a vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that most of Warren's constituents did not want him to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that it would be better if the senator didn't run himself, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent that supports the caller.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run for himself, with 38 percent supporting possible self-restraint and 48 percent against him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed regarding the possibility of running for 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd decide officially in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quoted PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son experienced, what he was going to experience when he returned, I was able to contact other families who also experienced the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries suffered by our soldiers," he said in front of those in attendance at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his capture as "the elephant in the room" and told him about his son and other veterans, "they return a little different, they come back harder, they come back and wonder if there's any respect for what they've given, their fellow soldiers and their pilots and every other military member to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, plus reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state, according to And Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support the legal challenge of the new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
The representation of 18 states and this district filed friends-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support policy-responsive asylum seekers, NBC News reported.
The full name of Grace v. On the question of an American Civil Liberties Union session in August against federal policy has not yet been revealed.
He said his partner "and his son was a member of a vicious gang," had insulted him, but the U.S. officials refused his asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as a country that faces major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy goes backwards with the 2014 immigration border council decision that allows black immigrants to escape domestic violence to submit asylum.
Attorney General District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "improvements the laws of the state party, federal, and international that have been in existence for several decades."
"Federal law requires that all claims should be decided on the basis of facts and certain circumstances related to the claim, and such prohibitions as it violates the principle," the friend-of-the short brief said.
Further prosecutors give a brief opinion that the policy that refuses the entry of immigrants is detrimental to the U.S. economy, says that they are likely to be a businessman and "put in the necessary work force."
Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions, in June ordered the immigration judge to no longer give relief to victims who fled the domestic violence and gang cruelty.
"It is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fears caused by race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion," the sessions said in the announcement of this policy on June 11.
It's not meant to relieve all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
It's a very sad rescue effort on the tree because the victim doubles when running in time to find a survivor.
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very exciting," says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her baby man who's in the place of refuge in the broken Palu town.
"Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
The clean water is rare."
People are looking back at their destroyed homes, taking watery things, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and taken care of in the hospital, damage caused by a 7.5-powered earthquake, which was a mess.
Some of them were injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from fractures of the back and shoulder bones, lying outside the Palus Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the room because of a powerful earthquake.
His tears flowed when he told him how he felt when the earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
"You can't save yourself.
I think I'm trapped by the ruins of the wall," Haris said to the Associated Press, he added his family was in the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, then shut up.
I did not know what was going on with my son.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the U.S. accused of Tiokok 'intimacy' by 'propaganda'
The week after the official Tiokok newspaper contains the four-page commercials on an U.S. newspaper that mentions the U.S.-Tiogk back-trade benefit, the U.S. ambassador to Tiokok accuses Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, which then referred to the Chinese Daily supplement in Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa - after accusing Tiokok of attempting to interfere with the US election on November 6, an accusation brought against Tiokok.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election, marking what the U.S. official told Reuters, was a new phase in the expansion of the campaign that Washington did to press on to China.
Although it's a common thing for foreign governments to put on advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now trapped in an ever-increasing trade war, which makes them raise the price levels of each other.
The T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T
Terry Branstad, a great U.S. ambassador to China and former former governor of Iowa, the main exporter of farm goods to China, says Beijing has damaged workers, farmers, and businessmen in the United States.
Tiokok, Branstad wrote an opinion at Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now double the intimidation by running advertising on our own free media."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Government of China uses the tradition of free speech and the press that is highly valued in America by carrying commercials paid off in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Inversely, in the street newspaper news kios-kios here, in Beijing, you'll find a barrier to different voices and will not see any real scrutiny of the different views that the Chinese may have on the problematic Tiokok economics, given the media under the control of the Communist Party of Tiokok," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in China refuses the offer to publish" his article, although he does not mention which newspaper.
Alerting Analysts, Republican Party Keep Women Off Elections · Global Voices
Because the important people in the Republican Party who stand up and defend the Supreme Court in facing some allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see a back attack, especially from women, on the upcoming public part-time election.
Emotions over this problem are very high, and most members of the Republic’s Party have been reported to have shown that they want to advance in the vote.
It can't be overlooked," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the desire of the Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake in the last few minutes to do an FBI investigation would be enough to ease the anger of the electorate.
"Vanita won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and a national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn said it on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "November is near!" when they held a demonstration in the Senate hall when the Republican Party controlled the Justice Committee to continue progressing in the Kavanaugh scandal after the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will come out of the list," political analysts not party Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's tall enough; and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women's voice pickers in the edge and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't give the voice."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, who explained in detail sexual harassment against himself by the Supreme Court chief, analysts would advise a further attack that follows if the Republican Party kept pushing him to move forward with confirmation.
"It's a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of the Republic Party, early last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the election of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on my reserve, it's also about how the Republican Party handles this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of the USA Priorities, a group that helps to choose the Democratic Party, pointed to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be breaking up about who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little bit of a choice that is more consistent with the last.
A new opinion poll YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents really believe or may believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or may believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or would lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said something similar about Ford.
After the encouragement from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges that Ford and one of the other subjects, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford's testimony under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that the drunk Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court's candidate showed his concern when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
A World Wide Web interviewer is planning to start the new Internet to face Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the World Wide Web investigator, launched a startup that was trying to match Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the legend of this technology, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, joking Berners-Lee said that the meaning behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to make "personal online data storage" or their own POD.
This storage may include a list of contacts, a list of tasks, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify that everything is available in one browser and everything at the same time.
The unique thing about storing this personal online data is that it really is up to the user who can access what kind of information.
At the company known as "personal ownership through data."
The idea of setting up Inrut, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is for the company to provide the resources, processes, and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
Now this company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some staff developers that are contracted to work on the project, and the volunteer code community.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralization application using tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether it would introduce or not a total change where all their business models would actually be reversed last night.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post in the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he set up the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been a voice that has an impact on the neutrality of the network debate.
Even when the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: remembering the name of WW1 Victoria Cross
The only last church in England to win Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior, remembered on his birthland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military privilege.
A memorial stone was released by his two grandsons on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was the "intelligence symbol" stone that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's performance won the award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "crossing the thick fog beneath the firing of the field and machine weapons."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with "the greatest bravery" leading the front line before rushing through the field weapons alone and crippling three deteases.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I knew I wouldn't be able to live but it was a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put down a flower sentence after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be involved in this parade" and added "the bravery of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will provide."
MMA fans all night to watch Bellator 206, but they even got Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been working all night to watch Bellator 206 full of trouble just to refuse to watch the main event.
San Jose's bill contains 13 fights, including six in the main card and is being displayed directly throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., right when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other, the English audience was struck when their neck turned to Peppa Pig.
Some feel unappreciative after they are engaged until the day of the special fight.
A Twitter fan describes the replacement to children's cartoons as "disgusting jokes."
"This is a government rule, that at 6 a.m. the contents are inappropriate to be shown, so replaced by a child program," said Dave Schwartz, senior president of marketing and communications Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa and pigs," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker's company said they'd fix their schedule by counting English audiences in the future.
"According to me, if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," said Coker.
"But right now there at 6:00 a.m. on Sundays and we won't be able to fix it until Sundays, their Mondays.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, at the time of the change, a lot of text goes backwards and everything doesn't educate.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Believe me, the next time that happens, it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce up to five fights of just six fights - as we used to do - and we're going to try to avoid excessive screening for fans, and we're successful.
It's an unfavorable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low self" related to sexual problems
The Olympicist Tom Daley said he grew up with self - centered feelings because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man says he doesn't realize it until he gets into middle school, that "not everybody like me."
Speaking for the first time at Radio 4 Desert Island Discs that Lauren Laverne brought, he said, he's talking about the right of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent doesn't really care about winning the Olympics.
The usual showman brought a long-running event, Kirsty Young, taking a few months' leave because of illness.
Looks like the people who are excluded from Laverne's first program, Daley says he feels "less than all the other people who grow up with him because "not the things that can be socially accepted to like men and women."
He said, "Until today, it is a feeling that is less than others, and a different feeling, that has become clear to me that gives me power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they knew about his sexuality.
The two Olympic bronze medalists have been renowned LGBT campaigners and have been using their performance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He says he's talking because he's lucky to be able to live open-mindedly without consequences and wants to give "hope" to others.
The world champion three times said he was in love with a man - film maker of the AS Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "surprise me."
Daley got married to Oscar's 20 - year - old boat that he had this year, and he said agelessness was not a problem.
"When you had so many problems at a very young age"--he followed his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was very difficult to find someone with the same age who had the same rate.
This couple has become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, all around 'I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there's a bigger thing than winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was that they've already got tickets for the London 2012 Olympics - because he wants to sit on the front row.
"I can't tell him 'you won't be sitting on Dad's front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he wasn't overcome," he said.
The next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"What I know is, this is what I dreamt of my whole life--to dive in front of the crowd of people in the Olympics, no feeling better than that," she said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which had joined him in his preparation for the Olympics and still made him laugh.
Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed his role when he offered Ryder Cup on Saturday.
U.S. Pegolf Phil Miccelson will record on Sunday when he played the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he had to change the role to avoid an unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played on two-year-olds to record the 12th-time record, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for four-ball games and a fourth-day group.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, the top winner five times this splits the time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on the scale, hoping to fix what has made it hard.
Never became the most upright golfer, even when he was at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man didn't fit to follow a very strict course in Le Golf National, which routinely served a long and harsh punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it wasn't scary enough for Miccellson, in the nine-day game on Sunday, to face a very accurate British champion Francesco Molinari, who had worked with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If these American people start 12 single matches with four points below, start with a hot start, then the Micchelson match is proven to be very important.
Furyk expressed faith in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understood his role today, clapped my back and hugged me, and said he'd be ready for the game tomorrow," Furyk said.
"She's so confident.
He was Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine the others, but that's the way they play, and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people do."
Miccelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This can mark the end of his career in Ryder Cup that will never match his individual record heights.
Miccelson's counting 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven series, although Furyk said his presence brought some things that could not be said on the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's pretty funny, he's funny, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he said.
"I think younger players have fun with him, too, this week, which is quite fun to see.
He gave me a lot more than just to play."
Captain Europe Thomas Bjorn knows the grandeur could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from the experience that someone who led big enough to his last single game in Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made her first debut at the 1997 Valderrama game, with the captain of the Séve Ballesteros team holding the top five points above the United States, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the slightest edge, won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we have great prominence in Valderrama; we have great prominence in Brookline, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we win, but just," says Bjorn, after watching Class of 2018, win 5-3 good on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you're going to enter a really boring game.
Come out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a target, and that target is winning this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side -- the world's greatest players."
It's nice to see the players playing on the hard golf course, Bjorn adds: "In this case I'm never going to advance myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, the individual players will advance, and this is a different thing to do.
It's really nice to be out there with a partner if everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to deliver to all the players, get the best out of yourself for the game tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his player to play better individually than they did as a yacht, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of the last day of the big game, has been part of the team that won at Brookline before the end of the defeat when Europe did "The Wonder of Medina."
"I remember every word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players towards the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as quickly as you see on Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the moment walks one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in different ways that we feel, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to take the lead in the fight against Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players are in the top order.
"I went with a group of these guys in order like this because I think I could close all the streets," Bjorn said about his only choice.
The new German warship was postponed
The latest German Navy ship was supposed to have started in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warship, but the ship would not be there until the next year because of its improved system and cost, the local media reported.
"Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship guard, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, who signed the military speaker.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the delivery problem had disturbed the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that had been dispatched by the Navy in 2007 will come as an old Bremen's ship's shipguard.
This ship will be equipped with powerful cannon, a series of anti-fly missiles, and anti-fly missiles, as well as a number of demon technology, such as radar removal, infrared, and aqueous keys.
Other important features include a longer period of treatment - should be allowed to use the latest ship of guards for two years away from the harbor.
However, the ongoing delay meant that this sophisticated warship - which was said to allow Germany to display its power overseas - would collapse as it entered its hours of duty, Die Zeit noted.
The bad fateful F125 ship had become a proclamation last year, when the German Navy officially refused to ship the ship and returned it to the wreckage of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the ship after the shipment.
Only a few of the reasons known behind the return of the ship, but the German media cites a number of "soft and hard-duty devices" that make the warship useless if used for the battle mission.
The lack of software is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship will be operated by the crew of 120 sailors - only half of the labor force on the older Bremen-class warship.
Also, it is known that the ship's bobots are very excessive that will reduce its performance and limit the capacity of the Navy to add to the upgrades in the near future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with the 7,000-ton bobot is believed to be twice as heavy as a ship with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to broken hard drives, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also a problem.
It is said to rise by surprise up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - rising from the beginning of €2.2 billion.
The problems that kept this new ship of guards were of great importance in keeping with the latest warning because of the intrusion of the German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Committee, admitted that the Navy actually "exhausted the ship with the ability to spread."
The officer said as time goes on, because old ships are no longer in use, but no replacement ships are provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg security ships could join the Navy.
National Trust listened to the secret bat life quietly
A new research was carried out on a farm on the High Plain of Scotland that aims to reveal how bats use natural landmarks in their food hunts.
Hopefully this will give new light on this unique flying mammalian behavior and help guide conservation activity in the near future.
This study by the scientist at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the public and soprano bats and long-eyed chocolate bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct a mobile survey using a gengam detector.
Sound experts analyzing all recordings will ensure the frequency of bat calls and species that perform what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be designed to draw images of the scale of the natural realm detailing their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor for the NTS, hoping this result will reveal which habitat area is most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland breeding and the best way to preserve the forest for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout England have dropped sharp in the last few centuries.
This is threatened with the building and development work that affects the nest and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, such as sticky paper hung to lure bats and chemical care of buildings, and a pet cat attack.
Actually, the bat is not blind.
Yet, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They're using advanced gem location techniques to find exactly the insects and the barrier on their flight routes.
NTS, responsible for taking care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres across the country, is very concerned about bats.
It has ten trained experts, who are routinely surveying, nesting, and sometimes rescue efforts.
This organization has also set up the first and only natural shells in Scotland in the Thrave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of ten bat species in Scotland.
David Thompson's farm manager says the farm is a suitable area for bats.
"Here in Thrave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there are still many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of bat testing before he took care of the property, because there is no doubt that the destruction of a breeding nest can kill up to 400 female and small bats, which may destroy the entire local population.
Kells are protected, killed, harassed, or harassed, or destroyed by them are illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Conservation Officer Kelelawar Trust, has encouraged the public to join in.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their population ends."
Ronaldo, who rejects the rape claim, is preparing lawyers to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the claim of rape on him as "false news," and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyer would charge the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which issued the charges.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was later expected to pay by giving $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in the Instant Instagram video to 142 million followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," the winner of Ballon d'Or five times said to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's the usual thing.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the charge, which they call "a suspicion report in the field of privacy that cannot be accepted," according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz said he would seek compensation as "replace moral damage in the amount corresponding to the weight of the violation, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
The accused incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga were reported back to the player's room, where he was allegedly raped, according to a report filed at Clark's District Court in Nevada.
Mayor says Ronaldo kneeled after the incident was accused and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who failed only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo claims that they both had sex, but it was on the basis of mutual desire.
Majorga also said he went to the police station and had done a vision of his wounds in the hospital, but then agreed to solve the problem outside the court because he felt he was "afraid to get revenge" and worried "will be shamed in public."
This 34-year-old woman says she's now trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's constantly experiencing trauma to the incident that she was accused of.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United when the attack was accused, and this summer he moved to the giant Italian Juve club with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: England 'will regret forever' the loss of carmakers
English "will regret forever" if he loses his status as a world leader as a car producer after Brexit, says Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added Toyota, England had told BBC that if England left the European Union without a deal, for a while it would stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of redundancies without a deal would harm Brexit in terms of employment costs.
The factory in Burnaston - which made Auris and Avensis production of Toyota - produced almost 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported to the whole European Union.
"My opinion is that if England comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we'll see the cessation of production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Another British car producer has expressed concern about their exit from the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade would go, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory at Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main issue related to what the car manufacturers said was the risk of supply chains if there was no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run according to the "right time" production principle, with every 37 minutes of both English and European customers in order to produce a car.
If England left the European Union without a deal on March 29, there might be a disturbance on the border, which industry believed could cause delays and lack of claws.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supplies at his factory in Derbyshire, said company representation, and thus production would be stopped.
Clark says the Chequers Theresa May plan for relations with the European Union in the future is "stabilized properly to avoid border checks."
"We have to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only enjoy success at this moment, but for us to get this opportunity," she said to the BBC Radio 4 program.
"The truth is not only from Toyota but also the other producers, that we should really be able to continue what has already been a very good supply chain."
Toyota can't say how long the production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warns that the increase will reduce the power of the factory and ultimately will damage the cost of the job.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the director of the United Workers' Union at the factory, says his member has become more concerned: "In my experience, as soon as this job is off, he will never come back.
The government speaker said, "We've put forward the right plan and made sense for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be back postponed, White House level
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with the high-ranking vice president Rod Rosenstein could "return another week" because the high-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh still continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the meddling of Russia in public elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia's helpers, and the potential that obstructs justice by the president.
Whether Trump's gonna fire a high-ranking deputy, which will jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has been triggering gossip in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a telegram to record a conversation with Trump and was likely to disrupt the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein objected to the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of the report that he was going to resign.
Instead, meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he'd "choose to no" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was rescheduled to avoid confrontation with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom will testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of a claim against Kavanaugh, which was later delayed by a full Senate vote.
Secretary of the Trump press, Sarah Sanders, performs on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "The date for the meeting has not been set, so it could be this week, I can see that putting it off for the next good week is also considering the other things that happened in the high court.
But let's just see and I've always wanted to share the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will be opposing the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace's interviewer asked him why.
Sanders said it was rare to meet, not because they dislike TV reporters "who are trying to attract attention," though, he said, "I disagree with the fact that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he proposed that immediate contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president did more of the sessions asking the immediate answer than the previous president," he added without mentioning the evidence: "We've seen the numbers."
The meeting will still happen, said Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried more often to do it and you've seen a lot of us do it in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in an open session or a press conference with visiting high officials.
Solo press conference rarely happens.
This week in New York, the president might show us why, doing a free and sometimes weird look before the reporters get together.
Health secretary wrote to European Union workers at NHS Scotland about concern over Brexit problems
Secretary of Health has written to the European Union staff working in NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the state and hoping they will still work here after Brexit's problems.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until England drew itself from the European Union.
The government of Scotland has committed itself to meet the permanent status costs of EU citizens working in the public service that is being transferred.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between England and the European Union on this withdrawal are still continuing, approaching the expected decisions in this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for the possibility that the scenario would not have a deal.
I know this must be very disturbing to you all.
That is why I now want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, apart from their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union, and others, carry valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was on an emergency operation after suffering head injury
Behind Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury in the defeat of 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed told the injured reporters that happened shortly before the fight was over.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," said Reed.
Trainer and medical power gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side of the field before putting it in the backyard and took it to further assess.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the operating room at Vanderbilt's Medical Center.
Harris adds that "there's no details about the type/grade of the injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, this two-layered student, was in his first season with the Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five teaspoons on Saturday before he left the game, which made the total of the teaspoon for this season 18 teaspoons.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher material costs when buying properties in England
Foreigners will be charged higher material costs when they buy properties in England, along with extra money that will be used to help the homeless according to a new Tory plan
This step will halt Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
Pay the costs of this material to those who do not pay taxes in England
The Finance Department estimates that it will collect up to £120 million per year - to help the homeless
Foreigners will be fitted with higher material beas when they buy properties in England - along with extra money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts in attracting young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and to target high income.
Costs of materials will be paid to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in England, as well as extra money that encourages the Government’s efforts to combat bums.
Additional costs - additional costs on the current cost of materials, including a higher level that was introduced two years ago on the second house purchase and a home purchase to be rented - up to three percent.
The Department of Finance expects this movement to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built properties were purchased by non-English citizens, which caused price increases and made it harder for the first buyer to set foot on the residential stairs.
Many rich areas in this country - usually in the capital city - have become "ghost cities" because many foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson found a cut in material costs to help more young people have their first home.
He accused the large construction company of maintaining the price of a permanent property by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to neglect quota for the homes that came to repair the "hospital disgrace" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reform recommendations, including renting and ending "no guilt" exaggeration.
He also wanted to give the council greater power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Then I promised I would dedicate the prime minister's office to restore the English dream--that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our homeless housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build lives here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies that are based abroad, to buy homes that are easy to live in.
For many people the dream of having a house is a very distant thing, and the conduct against the blouse remains clear."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scottish team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross said his "primary ambition" was to be Scotland's manager on some stages.
This 42-year-old Scottish player enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently occupy the third rank in League One, as opposed to three points of top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to sell my country as a player.
I got a B hat and it was him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I'm big and often watch Scotland's team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always becomes something interesting to me to come back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Manager Sunderland before Ross between Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former lord Alloa Athletic said he wasn't afraid to follow the tracks of the big names in that big club, after he had previously rejected the offer of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of this moment will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because the structure and facilities that are in this club, it's no longer doubtful to be in the Premier League," he said.
"Not an easy task to be there, but I might just see myself as a successful man here, if I can bring this club back there."
Karier Ross in team management only three years, after some time as an assistant boss in Dumbarton, and spends 15 months as a coach staff in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to third position, and turned St Mirren from the bar of degradation into the winner of the title of the Prize in the following season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he's ever done during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"This may be the intersection I have to go through," he recalls when taking over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm okay, making a living in a reasonable way, and enjoying some reasonable things.
But playing can be hard.
Many things you have to go through every week.
I'm still in work pressure, but in management it's fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt throughout my adult life."

Summer waves have increased the profits of British pubs fighting to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
Figures indicate that the pub and bar groups saw sales growth of 2.7 percent in July - but income in the restaurant went down by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who compiled those numbers, said: "The bright sun and British participation in the World Cup longer than expected means, the month of July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where the pub income increases by 2.8 percent, except the restaurant that gets strong ghosts.
It's down to 1.8 percent restaurant trade in June is going to get worse in July.
The sale of pubs and bars that sell drinks so far performs the strongest compared to what happened at the restaurant that went down.
Pubs who sell food also suffer from the heat of the sun, even though they don't separate the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just come out for a drink.
Sales throughout the whole pub and bar that sells drinks up 6.6 percent for this month, with who sells food down three percent."
Paul Newman, a recreation analyst and a RSM hotel said, "This has been continuing the train we've seen since April.
The weather and the effects of social events or sports are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of markets outside the home.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant group continues to fight to survive, although the decline of sales of 4.8 percent from year to year will be very painful over the current cost pressure.
The long summer should not come at the time of the operators who sell the food suffer bad times, and time will tell us whether the good enough temperature we've enjoyed in August will give you a little rest."
The total growth in sales throughout pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, showing the launch of the brand.

One of five children has a secret social media account they're hiding from their parents
Survey reveals, one of five children -- some of them still 11 years old -- have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed the "False Insta" page development
This news has raised concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say they have "mostly" accounts to show the parents
One of five children -- some of them still 11 years old -- keep the social media accounts kept secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed the rapid development of the "False Insta" account - a reference for a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say they operate the "mainly" account that has been cleared to be shown to the parents, while they also have a personal account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who asked someone else to "fuck me."
Research carried out by the British Digital Knowledge and Conference of the Head of School" and the Head of School of Women" (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 percent of students 11 to 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep a personal account.
Chief HMC, Mike Buchanan said, "This is a bother to so many teenagers who try to create an online space that their parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be a voice to the athletes at the Scottish Atlantic Council
Eilidh Doyle has been chosen to join the Scottish Atlantic Council as a non-executive director at the annual annual meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most widely recognized track and field of Scotland, and Ian Beattie's president describes this movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sports field to benefit from his international experience over the last few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we believe that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I acted as a voice to the athletes and I hoped I could really contribute and help lead the sports in Scotland."
America's athletic athlete, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among the total four Olympic gold medals and is now the BBC's expert, cannot now walk after a moment's ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day a month ago I suffered from stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said it was only a time to determine if I could recover and to what level the recovery would take.
It's like a hard job to get back to full recovery, learn how to walk back, and today do some practice!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The advertising of breast pumping that compares mother to cow has diverged opinions in the online world
The pump company has diverged opinions in the online world with an ad that compares the mother who has grown up with the cattle.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be "the breast pump that can be used with the first silence in the world," Elvie's consumer technology company issued an advertisement inspired by the video music genre to show the freedom given this new pump to express a mother.
Four moms dance in the mud with a cow straw following a song of lyrics like this: "Yes, I'm blushing myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you don't notice it, it's not ambiguity, this is my tits."
It goes on to refrain: "Pumpa out, pump out, I feed them dear, pump out, pump out, pump out, I water my woman."
However, advertisements published on the Facebook page of this company have led to online controversy.
With 77,000 seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a wide-ranging response from viewers, with many who say this makes "wrong" in the milk industry.
"A very bad decision using cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cattle must also be pregnant and give birth to milk, except the baby was stolen from them in a few days after giving birth," wrote one.

Another comment: "Trauma can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But why don't you use it to advertise a breast pump for the mother who has to take care of her baby?"
The others added: "A lost commercial."
Someone else stood up for the commercial, with a woman who admitted that she found the song "sweet."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still sick.
Meerating makes me feel exactly like a cow.
It's kind of crazy, but I'm accepting it.
It's a brilliant product," wrote someone.
The other comments: "This is a pleasant commercial that is intended for mothers who press (often at their place of work or toilet) and who feel like "breed."
It's not a commercial that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt danced with hidden pumps trapped in their arms.
The concept of this campaign comes from an audience of many women who blackmailed ASI who said they felt like cows.
But Elvie Pump is really hening, without cables or tubes and pins in the bra corrosive, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while blackmailing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie pump is a product that is worth launching with convincing and provocative.
By comparing the portrayal between expressing women and the sword cow we want to pump the ASI and all of its challenges, and showing it through the way of comfort and fun with the full freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie pump is the main news.

Hundreds of Big Boys silent in the Tende Camp at the Texas Border
The number of migrant children arrested is increasing even though the crossing of the monthly borders is still unchanged, as a result of some of the harsh statements and policies introduced by Trump’s government, which makes it difficult for the children to be held by sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are immigrants without documents, and fear of endangering their own ability to stay in that country by stepping forward to save the children.
The risk is rising in June, when the federal government announced that they had to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and Bea Cukai officer, testified to Congress that the agency had captured dozens of people who applied to support children under the age of youth.
The agency then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested didn't have a history of criminal records.
"About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or sponsoring group members are illegally in this country, and most of them are bad foreigners.
So we keep on hunting those people," said Mr. Albence.
Aimed to process children faster, the officials introduced new rules that required some of them to be present in court within one month after being arrested, not after 60 days, which had become a standard before, the security guard.
Most of them perform through video conference calls, not directly, to plead their legal status case to immigration judges.
Those who are considered unworthy of getting help will be deported directly.
The longer the children are arrested, the more likely they are to become more anxious or depressed, causing increased violence or escape efforts, the workers in the shelter and the system reports received in the last few months.
The lawyers say the concern is increased in a larger facility like Tornillo, which signs exist in a child struggling to tend to be ignored, because of its size.
They say that moving children to the camp town without making enough time for them emotionally or saying good-bye to their friends can worsen the trauma they've been fighting for.
Siriah asked the U.S., French and Turkish forces to immediately retreat
Speakers in the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asks Syrian refugees to return, even though the country's war has now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as prime minister's deputy, said that foreign troops occupied Syria illegally, for reasons of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with in whatever manner."
"They have to retreat as soon as possible and without applying any terms," he said to the council.
Moualem points out that "the battle against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million people fleeing their homes.
He asserts that Damascus will continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clean up all Syria's territory" from the terror groups and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially training and affecting Kurds and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in war - torn territory.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem confirmed that they should return immediately, and he blamed "a number of western countries" for "declaring extraordinary fears" that drove refugees to move away.
"We have asked for international society and humanitarian organization to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politicalize what should be the whole problem of humanity."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until the political agreement between Assad and opposition to end war was agreed.
The UN diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the grave of the last major Idlib rebellion has given rise to an opportunity to continue the political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevents major attacks by the Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where there are three million people living.
But Moualem asserts that the agreement has "clear timing" and creates the reason that military action will target the Mujahids including fighters of the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, which "will be crushed."
The order of the UN Staff de Mistura hopes to quickly call the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to make the post-war invitations to Syria and open the way to public elections.
Moualem sets out the terms of the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, stating that the work of the panel must be restricted "to examine the latest agendas," and warns against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win another public election in 2020 except for many liberals who hope, prosecution and scandals will soon end their presidency.
There's no doubt, "The end of the most dramatic president ever!"
Until now, no signs of weariness for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's main hourly rating has increased by more than twice as much to 1.05 million and MSNBC nearly three times as 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million main-time viewers, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has ranked the peak of cable TV ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the night of the main news.
"This is a spirit that attracts people because of something they don't understand," said Neal Baer, an ABC drama player "Designed Survival," about the secretary of the cabinet who became president after an attack that destroyed Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Sliding Into Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
He remembered going up a cab in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give Trump his voice.
Why, she asked.
She said, "Because she made me laugh," Miss Scovell told me.
The value of entertainment is determined by the ruin it will cause.
Obviously, unlike any other TV show, the story from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and restore the global economy.
On top of that, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
Thus, not only being a citizen of a nation who is aware at six o'clock did you find yourself watching the panel of experts discussing the use of the "back" source Bob Woodward for his book entitled "Fear," wearing Paul Manafort's sheep's leather jacket worth $15,000 ("the thick clothes with vanity," "The Washington Post) and the involvement of Stormy Daniels' terrible description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"The money from the policy he's doing makes it the same as a real event that cheers you up every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator "Pawn Stars," about the performance player and the Trump daily story.

When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a bright 80-degree outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was hiding while watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't set himself free, not with Brett Kavanaugh prepared to face the Senate Justice Committee and then the Supreme Court according to its balance.
"I remember when we did all the crazy show that day and people said, "This is the beginning of the Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's like a joke, but it turns out they're right."

A lot of money from outside has flooded the most severe part-time election competition in the White House.
Pennsylvania 17 had a cash flow, thanks to the re-enactment of the congress district that offered two learned men in the same chair parade.
Recently this district of Pittsburg was re-established, introducing Conor Lamb of Rep. Democrat - who won a seat in another district through the special election last spring.
Progressing forward against other peasants, Keith Rothfus Republic, now representing the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which has collapsed with the new Pennsylvania 17 district.
These maps were resettled after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally on the side of the Republic party.
The competition in the new district of Pennsylvania 17 has resulted in the huge funding of the campaign between the major party's financial side, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became more known in Pennsylvania after thin victory in the special March election that was public-planned for Congress District 18 Pennsylvania.
The chair has been housed by the Republican Party officials for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts sent the Democratic Party a little higher.
The U.S. Considering Sentences to El Salvador for Supporting Tiokok, then Back
The diplomats made sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized Beijing, with a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and ordered hotels in Panama until his partner expelled the Trump Organization Management team.
Foreign Department officials decided to pull back the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest ruling that no longer recognized Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department speaker, appeared in a statement earlier this month.
But the punishment was only considered against El Salvador, who had received help at about $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a cut in the financial and visa control system, would hurt Central America and increase its levels of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meeting continued, North and Central American officials postponed high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue the same meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in the mid-September, senior government officials confirmed that they wanted to continue the conference, in order to effectively end the trial for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for October's mid-October, as an important signal to the government at the meeting, to capture the diplomats.
And three U.S. envoys secretly return to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new reproofs or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House speaker for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate put forward by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion of this unclear state.
Their statements are reinforced by an external analyst close to the government and are also talking about this unclear state of affairs.
Study Story
Another startling story is Robert Mueller's special advisor report on the possibility of the impeachment of Mr. Trump, which currently has very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discusses whether Trump's campaign is collapsing with Russia in an attack on our public election.
When Congress moves hands, Mr. Trump will be asked for responsibility from him, just as he prepares to go again in front of the electors, and may eventually be a jury of his partners.
So there's still a lot to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's rule cannot be avoided - or his equality in Europe.
There's a better choice we make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we're fighting.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West were against him and to support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of massacre.
Early history revolves around such an intersection, and the fast - paced or postponed democracy is inescapable.
Now Americans face a few points of this change.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the one who watches for the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since then reports that, last year, she suggested that the president be kept secret and held that she was not worthy of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times account is not true.
"How do we respond if the newly asked F.B.I. investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair--or if he was filed with the Supreme Court even if there were strong charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to give the part-time voice to Congress that's gonna call for Trump's accountability?
If we fail to pass the test, democracy will get worse in a long time.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that ever inhabited my big embassy.
He survived, then emigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a sat candle on a table that had been covered with a swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope for our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans feels optimistic about fighting Rapid Vienna
Rangers hailed Rapid Vienna on Thursday, victory over Austria, pursuing good developments in Spain against Villarreal early this month, will strengthen their position to get away from the G League Europe Group.
A knee injury made the mid-street of Graham Dorrans could not appear in the first season until the result of 2-2 against Villarreal, but he believed that Rangers could use the result as a stone to a greater force.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team," the 31-year-old player.
"In this match we're sure we can get something and go by counting one point.
In the end, we might be able to do it, but, we think, the result may be just.
In the first round, they may perform better but in the second round, we rise and become a better team.
Starting on Thursday, tonight is another big European day.
We hope to be able to count three points even though it's going to be a hard match because they have good results in their last fight, but, with support support behind us, I'm sure we can go on and get positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there's a very good hope in this club.
This squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's good practice.
May we now develop, put the past behind us and achieve success."

Although the surveyers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, there were few people discussing it with their family.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study discuss the cost of long-term care with their mates.
Only 10 percent of them say they're talking about this with their kids.
"They want family members to provide treatment, but there's no way to start the discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
Here's the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You won't be able to prepare your own family to provide treatment if you don't inform your wishes first.
Get down with counsel and your family, where and how you get treatment, because what you choose will mean very important in determining the cost.
Place your financial advisors: Your advisors can certainly give you his help in showing you how to pay those costs.
Your choice of long-term care includes traditional long-term insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies that guarantee these costs or assure yourself of your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents to deal with legal disputes.
An immediate hint of power for your health care, that is someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee if your desire is carried out by professional people when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, the letter of authority in the matter of finance should be considered.
Someone who trusts to take care of all your financial decisions you have to choose, other than to make sure your bills are paid if you cannot.

A man was shot in the wind at Ilfracombe
A man was shot in a windshield on his way home from a party at night.
The 40-year-old victim is in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots about the chest, the stomach, and the hand.
The shooting event was described by the officer was about 2:30 BST, and was said to be "random."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The wounds that the victim suffered did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses had been filed by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis struck Indonesia
Earthquakes and tsunamis were so devastating that the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, had wiped out a small number of 384 people, the prisoners, and the casualties were estimated to increase.
It cut off the communication to create officers who allow difficult relief to obtain information from the Dogalea Regiment, a region to the north of the town of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake center that hits with 7.5 Richter scale.
In the tree, after disaster, over 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below is a number of main facts about the cities of Palu and Dogalea, on the island of Sulawesi:
It was the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located on the narrow edge of the western coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, this city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Dogalea, meanwhile, is a vast Regency of more than 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
This county, which is an administrative area below the province, is estimated to have 299,200 people in 2017.
The main economic eyes in the South Sulawesi province are looking for fish and hatching plants, especially on the Domigaa coast.
However, the presence of important nickel development is also important in this province, although most of them are centered in Morwali, across the Sulawesi coast.
Recorded in the last 100 years, Palu and Dogalea have been hit several times by a tsunami, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Relief Corps.
In 1938, over 200 people died in a tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes in Domgala.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in western Domgala.
Centrally, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Five and because of its regular earthquake.
A number of earthquakes and tsunamis that have plagued the last few years are as follows:
2004: 26 December, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, on the western coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, to the point that 226,000 lives on the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half the victims were killed in Aceh.
2005: By the end of March and early April, there were a number of devastating earthquakes on the west coast of Sumatra.
On the island of Nias, on the shore of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
In 2006: 6.8 - magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most dense island in Indonesia, triggering tsunamis on the south coast and resulting in nearly 700 deaths.
In 2009: An earthquake struck 7.6 in the vicinity of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
The victim died by more than 1,100 people.
In 2010: One island on the island of Mentaui, off Sumatra, was also hit by a 7.5 - powerful earthquake, resulting in a tsunami of 10 feet [10 m] at a time that swept over dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: The Pidie Jaya Regiment, Aceh, also suffered a radical earthquake and resulted in the destruction, as well as the panic of people who remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004 last year.
Although the tsunami did not take place this time, over 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, called a tourist island, also suffered a massive earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of which were on the northern side of the island.
The quake unfolded thousands of buildings and while it covered thousands of tourists.
The firstborn son of Sarah Palin was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and vice president candidate, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, blocked from reports of domestic violence and against arrest efforts, as reported by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
Based on a police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, she seized the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to Pre-Trial Prison Mat-Su, with $500 fine without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As reported by the news network, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, said he was "innocent, sure" when he was asked about his defense.
Palin faced three minor violations of Class A, which could have him sentenced to one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was charged with a class B criminal charge, with one day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
For Palin, criminal charges are not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, who called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is now submitted to the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing reports of domestic violence, and ownership of weapons intoxicated, which also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of staring at his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin obtained a lockdown from the emerging vector group linking her son’s violence with PTSD as a result of her duties throughout Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake until at least 384 victims died.
The 7.5 - scale earthquake of Richter’s potential sparking tsunamis has struck thousands of homes.
Electrical networks and communications networks are broken down, and death rates are forecast to increase over the next few days.
Earthquakes in those days hit the middle of Sulawesi, which is located in eastern Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show how great the moment of the disaster is going wide through social media.
Hundreds of middlemen gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the town of Palu at that time, when the tsunami broke up.
The federal prosecutors attempted a death sentence that rarely occurred for the terrorist suspect in NYC.
The federal prosecutor in New York attempted death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- that punishment was rare and had never been done in a federal crime-related state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was expected to do an attack on his rented truck from Home Depot to a pedestrian and a bicycle driver on the bike route along the West Side Highway at Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death sentence, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "inventively" killed the eight victims and "inventively" also caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of willingness to execute the death penalty, which was submitted to the New York South District.
According to the court documents, the two defendants are allowed to be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury struck Saipov with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in carrying out violent acts, usually used federal prosecution in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and attempted motor vehicle damage.
According to prosecutors, the attack requires "substantial planning and initial termination," as a description of Saipov's crime done with "sense, cruel, and savage."
Expressed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss of family and friends from Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims on that incident were tourists from Argentina.
Counted a decade since the New York South District, the death penalty came last.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, the defendant in charge of the murder of two drug users, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last execution of a death sentence in the federal court of New York in 1953, was dropped in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been found guilty in the espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg’s husband was executed with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no regret as long as he walked day and month after the attack.
When asked by the investigator, he said that he was happy with what he had already done, arresting the police.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that his attack inspired the ISIS video on his phone, as in the indictment.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be put in his hospital room, for the police.
He said he was innocent of 22 charges dropped to him.
David Patton, one of the federal generals representing Saipov, said "clearly disappointed" against the prosecution's decision.
"According to us, the decision to execute death rather than receive a criminal sentence of life without bail will only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident," said Patton's father.
Previously, Saipov’s campaign team had applied to the prosecutor to refrain from bringing down the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for the Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage is calling for 'punishing the people' today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians had to 'make the heat' Eurosceptics - because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested to join in negotiating with the EU.
Conservative supporters, Peter Bone, told the street action in Birmingham that England 'should be out' today if only Farage served as Secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenges that May faces in the reconciliation of his shared position have been beset by supporters of Remain Tories who join in a separate protest attack against Brexit in the city.
Prime Minister fought to maintain his Chequers commitment plan to remain on track even in the midst of the Brexiteries, Remainers and the European Union.
Allied countries insist that he would be moved to advance to reach a deal with Brussels, even if he got a bad reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and Manwah to decide between his advertising packages and the 'impairment'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted 'to get out of Chequers.
His translation, that Farage should appoint colleagues to be responsible in negotiations with Brussels.
"If the responsibility stays with him, we'll be out now," he said.
Members of the Wellingborough Parliament are adding: "I'm ready to stand up to support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
He said to the European Union, "We are not fighting in the world's war to be subdued.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.'
Bone issued the suggestion that the public opinion might change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British thinking has changed and wants a permanent condition, it's totally not true."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, pointed out to the reporters: 'Simple, I want to say: O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Checkers are not popular in the public, but the Opposition will not choose them, because they are not popular with our parties and our activists who are seriously down the road and make us chosen in the first position.
Our petition, get rid of Chequers and start listening to us.'
By a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister retains their work when their promise is fulfilled."
Farage said that the demonstration of politics had to be broken so that they could 'solve the heat' if they wanted to disobey the referendum decision in 2016.
‘This most precious moment is the trust between our peoples and our political groups,’ he said.
'They're trying to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming to them that 'we won't let you get away with it'.'
He added in a message to the audience of a enthusiastic society: 'I want you to make our political group, who are preparing to disobey Brexit, also feeling the heat.
‘We are moving the camp of the people of this country that will win us in Brexit and will never give up until the British independent, ruling itself, and boasting.’
Meanwhile, the Remainers mass moves through Birmingham before calling for action in the city center for two hours.
The active line seems to spread the Tories Against Brexit banner after setting the line at the end of this week.
Companions in the Manga line, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the conservative group related to the security issue of their party application when the conference was opened.
"These are the people who told us that they could master the IT system and all technology for Canada, whatever, for the anti-drinking border, in the endless free trade order in Ireland," he healed.
‘ Really, really, really.
There's no good Brexit at all,' the cure.
Warren's planning to do a serious crash in the president's caller's auspicious.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said he was going to "break the president's chaplain's auspicious" after the election moment in November.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party declared its future in the city hall in the western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who repeatedly vouched for President Donald Trump, recommends himself for re-election in November against the state-owned GOP representation, Geoff Diehl, campaign leader Trump in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was marked as an opponent of Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke is the 36th with its voters, which has been broadcast in the city hall since Trump's inception.
A guest asked him a question, was there any plans to run as president.
Warren also replied, that this was the right time for women to enter the Washington ring to restore our corrupt government, and that was part of the time for women to occupy the summit.

Ajang Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after the team admitted victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear when Valtteri Bottas was in front of Lewis Hamilton in the qualifier on Saturday that would bring the Mercedes team's order had a big role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton because he kept his position in turn for the first two and pulled Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel became the first to rush into the pit and let Hamilton move into the forest at the end of the crowd, something that should be very determined.
Mercedes entered pit one lap after and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to travel after some of the trailing actions that showed the downside of Ferrari's driver left the inside empty with the risk of surviving after a double move to survive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started off on the back grid line and was in the seventh position at the end of his first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race because he held the tire shift to target quick resolution and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth position.
He finally got into the pit on the 44th lap but couldn't raise his step on the eight laps left because finally Raikkonen took the fourth position.
It was a hard day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man left me.
Tim has done a wonderful job to have a second," Hamilton says.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein on a relic on Saturday through his village, he didn't leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the sexual violence of Judge Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking in a religion in West Virginia, the president did not directly convey a statement by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee, instead of commenting on what is happening at the age of one that shows people that "bad and ugly and dishonest."
"Something can happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry and evil people and obscene and dishonest," he said.
"When you saw the amps and the leaks then they said "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak it," he added, as a senator's impression.
Feinstein has sent out a letter invoking the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July in the past, and it has leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein's failure to come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein spoke to the committee, delivered Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret and I kept her secret as she asked."
But his rejection seemed to be disapproved by the president, who commented during the relic on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Judge, who was accused of sexual harassment against three women, the president was impressed by the democratic assumption of using charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see crime, greed, they don't care who they hurt, what they have to walk for power and surveillance," the Mediaite report on the president's speech.

Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants in front of Dundee
Dundee Stars paid off Friday in the Elite League while fighting Belfast Giants by winning a field match with a score of 5-3 on Saturday.
Giant got the top two goals first after two strokes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.

The powerful flurry continues to shake the region and many are trapped in ruins in the town of Palu.
But his comrades fled for their safety, a 21-year-old man, Anthonius Gunajan grande, refused to leave his post in a heavily shaken guide tower in Sis Al Jufri Highland, Palu.
He chose to survive to make sure the 6321 Waterboat flight that was then on the runway, could safely take off.
He then jumped from the traffic tower when he felt that the tower was falling.
He died after he was in the hospital.
The speaker spoke the Indonesian Navigation Services Agency, Yohannes Sirat, delivering his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from Australia's ABC news.
We provided a helicopter from Balicpan in California to take her to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached the Tree.
"We're all sad to hear this," he adds.
Meanwhile, the authorities worried that the victim died could reach thousands after the National Disaster Deployment Body provided access to the cities of Dogalea, Sigi, and Boutong.
"The body is believed to continue to grow because many of the victims are still suffering ruins and many others can't be achieved," said the national body speaker for the removal of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's disaster.

The water of Niujini delivered on a release on Saturday afternoon, the party was unable to identify a passenger.
The experts said his side had been working with the local authorities, the hospital and the inspector to find the man.
The authorities do not quickly respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as his age or his citizenship.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crews, after they hit the water while trying to land on Chuuk Island airport.
The officer announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The crew told six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a stable condition.
What causes a complete accident and sequence of events is still unclear.
The two U.S. airmen and the U.S. Navy declared their aircraft landing in the lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses feel that the plane went beyond the runway.
U.S. citizen Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's really something good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to run up the waist through the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He told the panic and screamers, and he suffered a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close to the repaired docks also helped rescue by using rubber boats to transport people to land before the plane sinks in the depths about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.

Analysis of the U.S. Justice Department Paul Rowlett's testimony for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a big line for the jury about how he used his cell phone footage to collect various movements of the defendants who were 29 years old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received the location data of some cell phone showing Tellis was at one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to the opposite with the previous statement of the defendant, announced Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone was at one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis told the truth when he said that he was in the Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies announced by Tellis were his claims that he knew Chambers about two weeks before the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate they know each other within a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers died, Tellis sometimes deleted messages, calls and contacts the Chambers information from his phone.
"He wiped the victim out of his life," said Hale.
It's scheduled to start the closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would lead to the jury after that day.

The other black people?!
NY amateurs demand a couple because they attack after they deliver "realistic" messages.
A New York nanny demanded one couple because he had attacked discriminatively after receiving an indirect message from a mother pleading and saying that he was "the other black."
The couple refused to consider them to be racial, and considered it more like "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed his anxiety when he realized that the new care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black as soon as he was on his first day of work in 2016.
"I don't know what other people are," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending her to her husband, she just sent her to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, stating that they were taking out their nanny, who was a mixed African-American citizen, because he had done a bad job and he was expecting the Philippines, based on New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then returned to Uber.
At this point, Maurice demanded that the couple provide compensation for the dismissal, and asked for compensation about $350 a day for the six-month term, in return for the nursing work that she had to work at first, even if there was no contract.
"I want to show them, see, you can't do something like that," she said to the Post on Sunday, and then add "I know it's discrimination."
The couple against claims that they say they're racist, say that the workers that Maurice fired are a reasonable thing to do, they worry they can't trust him after he's offended,
"My wife has sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband said to the Post.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been rude to, even though it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As if wrapped up in "expression," Plasco said his wife had just given birth to her baby for two months and was in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone in such a condition?
That's not a good thing to do," investment bank adds.
As the legal case is still under way, the public opinion court has made rapid complaints against the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
The Paddington Publisher is worried that the readers will not have anything to do with the bear's speech, the new newspaper is being revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born not far after her book was received, was explained in a letter.
It's so funny to know how we know about Paddington's great success."
He said his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspired by a child's book with a bear toy, who would be very optimistic about his work that had been rejected, he added the anniversary of the 60th book publication that felt "sweet satisfaction" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father quite proud of the end of his achievement.
"He's a pretty quiet person, and he's not a proud person," he said.
"But because Paddington is very meaningful to him, it's like you have a child who has achieved something: you're proud of them even though not all your efforts.
I think he looks at Paddington's success like that.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say good-bye to her on the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pastor 2 hospital, but the doctors had failed to save her.
"Nad made a quiet call to convey it very bad that he was very likely not to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said he would die in a cage two minutes ahead and he asked me to say good-bye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors have given her to keep her heart beating slowly and leave her system.
He's been dead a few moments during the handling process and everything feels like it's dead.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't moan, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers - without realizing what had been going on.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head is dizzy and my tears keep dripping all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but the moment in the flight I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much she loves him."
The grieving women posted cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones were trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be reached for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that the smile gives rise to the mood."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying if there will be any further effects."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can close and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and keep quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day-- when the kids opened their gifts he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a major trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "It's making a hole in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was in uncertainty when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking for-- an investigation that's limited to time, limited to the scope-- we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr. Flake's review on Saturday, add that he's afraid of the committee "break" in the middle of the board's failure.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republic's supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their rejection is due to time.
The legislative election is five weeks away, on November 6th - if, as expected, the Republic does it to be bad, they will become very weak in their opportunity to make the people they want to be elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him meeting with Ashley his wife, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats sit.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean conspirators under Kim
The number of people who were swindling from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-a power seven years ago, in the wake of a Korean parliament member.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Southern Union Ministry data, said there were 1,127 repairs last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said border control between North Korea and Tiokok and the higher price charged by human smugglers was the key factor.
Pyongyang doesn't give a public comment.
Most Northmen were finally offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul says over 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through Tiokok, which had the longest border with North Korea and were easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
Triumphs treated their opponents as illegal migrants from a nation and often forced them to return to their homeland.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is technically still in the war - has greatly increased in the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the delayed negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on a nuclear-free Korean bridge.
But on Saturday, North Korean Minister Ri Yong-ho blames U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, we will not be able to drop our weapons alone," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "histeris," said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The opposition leader Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of "histerialism" and said he didn't fit in temperament to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman performs like that, they'll say 'hissterism'," Pelosi said about his reaction to the witness Kavanaugh in front of the Yudish Council Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally objected to the charge that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, a few times almost screaming and having trouble talking about his family and his years of high school.
He also flungly condemned Democracy in the committee, saying that the charge against him was "unreasonable and coordinated character killings" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's witness proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was rude to the Democratic people.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democracy," he said.
Pelocrats objected that he would try to accuse if he was approved, and if the Democrat gained more voice in the Council of Representation.
"I'll say like this -- if he doesn't really tell Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't fit just to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he as a Democrat was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision to the Health Service or Roe v. Wade, because he was seen as a conservative justiceist.
In the high court, Kavanaugh avoids the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not a time for someone who's hysterical and rude to go to court and expect us to say, "Is it not so great?"
And the woman needs to handle it.
It's an ethical decency, anger for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"It's not strange to me, what do you think?"
He went on, and said, "I am very helped by a woman who is an executive somewhere, who says that she also cries when she is angry, but develops a technique that means that she is angry and starts crying, and says to the man who is talking to her, 'You may think I am sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he goes on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
The tears were shed as a way out of anger in part because he was essentially misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, in a man-dominated office, once when I cried out with unexpressed anger, was my bowl being harassed by an older woman - a cold manager who was always a little afraid - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and would be happy because they think they did it."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair outside the wedding on the boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, very frustrated, understand that there was no reason for herself not to run as president.
"That's not a mature decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone calls it "The Princess of Snow and Seven Dwarves."
Since it was too late in the campaign, he stayed behind in the fundraiser, so he swore he would not follow the election unless he had managed to raise $2 million.
It's a fight to defeat.
He found out that some of his supporters gave him $1,000 to the man just gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
When he announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overpowered by the emotions - thanks to the people who supported him, frustration with a system that made the fundraiser so difficult and to target the electorate from the delegation, and the anger against sexism - made it difficult to talk.
"You might think that I'm too nervous," recalls Miss Schroeder about how the press reacts to her.
"You'll think that Kleenex is my sponsor's company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write in my mind?
"Do you cry?"
How the US-Tiokok trade competition could be good for Beijing
The fighting between the U.S. and the T-T-Kkok is so exciting, and when the fight is still far from over, the conflict between the two countries may only benefit Beijing in the long term, according to the experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fires the first warning this year by taxing T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T
A very significant gesture started this week with a new rate that affected items worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxed half of all goods entered into the U.S. through China.
Beijing has paid back every time, recently priced five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
Tiokok's been begging to accommodate the United States once and for all, and the world's second largest economy will not change in the near future.
Sending Washington to retreat means following the will, but publicly going to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its card correctly, the pressure of US trade competition can positively support the long term by reducing dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that the rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can make the economic movement of both countries more dangerous than what we've observed before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
The Syrian 'prepared' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says that they are ready for the return of voluntary refugees and offer help to rebuild a nation destroyed by over seven years of war.
Speaking to the U.N. General Council, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem says that conditions in his country are improving.
"Today's a more stable and secure situation in the field thanks to the progress in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of terrorism destroyed to restore it as it was.
All conditions are now present because of the return of voluntary refugees to countries that they must leave because of terrorism and a comprehensive economic decision that makes their lives day after day and the eyes of the day as a target.
The United Nations estimated that more than 5.5 million people in Syria had fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people who are still living in that country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syria regime would receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive assistance or conditional assistance from countries that supported rebellion.
