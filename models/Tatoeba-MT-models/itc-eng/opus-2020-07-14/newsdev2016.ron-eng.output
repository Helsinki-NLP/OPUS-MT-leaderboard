The former head of the Brazilian presidential office is brought before the court
Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential office for alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme on the Petrobras state oil company.
The federal prosecutor's office said Jose Dirceu will be sued for the charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Another fourteen people will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, former Treasurer of the Workers' Party, in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, former president of the Petrobras business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the Workers' Party in government in custody for the links with this scheme.
Dirceu served as head of office of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August from home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
The prosecutors stated that Dirceu developed the Petrobras Mitage Mitage Scheme, accepted bribes while it was in operation and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the vote scandal purchased.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in the form of bribes and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also have included bribes to Petrobras directors in exchange for emflated contracts.
"Miraculous" recovery of a student survivor of the Peshawar massacre
A paralysed teenager who was shot four times in the most brutal terrorist attack in Pakistan managed a "miracle" recovery after treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, the doctors in Pakistan had told him that he would never be able to go again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be released later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, in the usual morning of Tuesday, Mohamed stood at the hour of first aid and listened carefully to his teachers.
Even then, seven men armed in uniforms of security agents entered the army's public school.
They carried belts with explosives and had to carry out a simple mission: to kill all the men, women, and children who came out in their way.
“I can’t forget what happened that day,” Mohamed says with a rough look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... then I heard gunshots outside.
The terrorists went inside and started killing.
Mohamed describes how he pulled four students out of the amphitheater while the carnage was taking place.
Then he says he heard his friend Hamza shouting.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he in the head.
Most of the people killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he passed out and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the waist down.
The Doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then the Doctors in Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go again.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul out," says Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest in my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionately cricket would never be able to use his feet again.
They campaigned and asked for help from Pakistani television, attracting support from famous people like Imran Khan, a crichet player who became a politician.
In the end, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and give him treatment at the Harley Street private clinic in London.
Neurosurgery consultant Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "afraid" when he reached the hospital.
“He spent the last [some] months lying in bed, without being able to move from one side to the other, says Malik.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in too good shape.
A vertebrae from the base of Mohamed's vertebral column had been destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in his shoulder, hip and back during the attack, and his lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during a six-hour operation, Malik and his team managed to reread the nerve endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised at what happened next.
Just a week after the operation, Mohamed got up and started taking his steps and going.
We didn't expect such a good result.
It was a miracle," he says.
In less than two weeks after the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged fate and began to go again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But he is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army, and fight terrorism.
"I feel like I still have a chance to live," he says, showing the pictures with weapons drawn by him next to school manuals and pens.
Physically, Mohamed becomes increasingly powerful every day, but psychological trauma through which he passes and now is unimaginable.
"My age has not fallen," he confesses.
In my school little children were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes a tear, comforts him, and says: “I see my son walking again. ”
He'll be able to keep his life going.
Three's Super Voice 4G Service offers better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
Three mobile phone provider launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve the reception within buildings and in rural areas without signals.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a lower frequency spectrum.
Other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long Term Evolution (VolTE)".
This works for the moment only with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the next months.
Three mentions that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to the service by 2017.
Chief Technology Officer Bryn Jones said: “By the end of the year, one million of our customers will have access to better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than so far.”
The views are prepared for the stage of pantomime
The stage of pantomime is very important for theaters throughout the United Kingdom, many of them preparing for this year's internship.
Now, at the Christmas Theatre, some of the biggest names in the showbusiness are participating.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Cinderella - first in the role of one of the evil sisters, and second in the role of the fairy.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at the BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: “If I don’t do anything, I feel guilty ”
Steven Wilson was recently designated the great winner of Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has often been called the most professional musician in the progressive rock world.
The musician Talent won three awards at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In its five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a clever, expressive and captivating work of art".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of many musical projects, the best known being the rock band Porcupine Tree.
Now, before two shows with the closed house at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activity.
He told BBC about his love for vinyls and his loaded program and explained how the comedy actor Matt Berry got to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up even in the end of the vinyl era and I remember that then I was just waiting for the CD to show up, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You were buying a disc, going with it home, having a scratch and you had to bring it back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example the classic one, they're better than vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing else you really value.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice painting hanging in the living room.
It's something you can hold in hand, while you're getting absorbed by the lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have to be that way if too young kids remember the wines they like this kind of experience.
Do you have any wine you especially hold in?
I admit I got rid of all the wines in the '90s.
All the wines I've got are bought again.
I started with the idea of restoring the collection I was 15 years old, but I've crossed that line.
The first record I got my parents to buy was Out of the Blue from Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately it is somewhere in a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a gateway to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transience compilation on the vinyl?
It was originally designed as an idea for record shop day, but I missed the opportunity.
My home suggested to gather a few of my shorter and more accessible songs.
I have become easily obsessed with the idea of doing something like "introducing into Steven Wilson's music" and I have definitely kept the project to be launched on the vinyl alone.
Whoever buys the vinyl also receives a downloadable version of the high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in her real light?
No, because, although I'm focusing on longer music pieces, there's one thing I've always valued above anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses more on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, has passed the time test because they have always put the emphasis on the melodic part and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for Albert Hall's shows?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different every night.
In the first, it will be a version of the Hand show. Erase. that we had this year, but on the steroids, with a few guests.
The second night is going to be more like an incursion into my history, it's being more focused on the fans who followed me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And the rest of the tour team are big fans of [Channel 4 comedy series] Toast of London, to the point where we give all the time quoted from it.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, too, so I bought him the album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
It seems to me I'm extremely lucky to have him in the opening.
You remixed albums of some bands like XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does that affect your own music?
I'm not consciously inspired by this, but, inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they remain in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was, without a doubt, the most progressive old school album I've ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the year before.
Current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I was working at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You're often described as the busiest progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can remove the word progressive.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I'm not saying that proudly, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an incredibly powerful work ethic.
If I don't do anything for a whole day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why remix work was a gift, because it means I don't have to do all the time just my music.
The music industry is a tough place to do a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy I don't think I would have survived.
Transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on September 25th.
Steven Wilson will play at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his 2015-2016 European Tour.
A new contract brings jobs back to Skytrans
New Skytrans re-engaged some of the airline's personnel who lost their job when the old Skytrans broke into bankruptcy.
Skytrans, the reinstated company of Northern Queensland, helped a 25 million-dollar contract to transport the employees of the QGC natural gas company, which meant that 18 crew members got their job back.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidised routes that formed a large part of the airline's business.
The bankruptcy has led many communities to face a potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, the national-liberal federal parliament for Northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the criticism of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, executive director of Skytrans, said the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We managed to reassess 18 Skytrans staff members with a full schedule, as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC customers.
In just five months, we increased with 100% work force, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract seeks to extend Skytrans's flight operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which serves Cape York and the Torres Strait, and also to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 round-a-week flights for QGC staff and Brisbane entrepreneurs to Chinchilla and Taroom locations, in his 36-place Dash-8 aircraft, starting on Monday, 26 October.
Tony Nunan, CEO of QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following a tendering procedure.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
Skytrans contract maintains its high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
The Liberal and New Mother's Parliamentarian Kelly O'Dwyer is advised to make a greater supply of milk to avoid losing votes in the Chamber
Looks like more women will be part of the firm.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested on Mondays and there are strong signals that more women will occupy portfolios.
One of the government's rising celebrities, Kelly O'Dwyer, was advised to make a bigger milk reserve for her newborn to avoid breast-feeding to intervene in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government's disciplinary officer, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his Labour counterpart to find out what is the most appropriate approach for a nursing parliament, in accordance with the orders in force.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer and her daughter Olivia.
According to the orders in force - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - the mothers who breast-feeding get a vote power in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exemption before he consulted the opposition's disciplinary officer, Chris Hayes, in this matter.
Things rushed on two occasions, when O'Dwyer could not attend a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to hold a speech because he had just begun breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the parliament was thinking of making a bigger milk supply rather than breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, Queensland Parliamentary, is responsible for government discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
They both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources of Buchholz and O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media that the Higgins division representative was furious when he was told to make a bigger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This is revealed even when the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull works at his new cabinet.
Buchholz, the Liberal National Parliamentary of Queensland, was promoted as responsible for the discipline by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the censorship test of February this year.
O'Dwyer, alongside Amanda Rishworth of the Labour Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three mothers in Parliament.
Former disciplinary officer Phillip Ruddock was removed just a few days after Abbott faced a motion of censure by which he wanted to be removed from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolik, the Tasmanian liberal, was also promoted and appointed deputy discipline officer.
Nickolik had recently held the front page of the papers, after it was discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message calling on him to give up Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter, Olivia, was born in May.
He's one of the three MPs who became a mom this year.
The Labour Party spokesman Catherine King said Wednesday that the voting power for breast-feeding mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven years old]," she wrote on Twitter.
The responsible with discipline should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said Wednesday that he wants more women in his office.
"No one wants more women than me to see in power, influence, in Parliament, in ministry, in the whole country," the Prime Minister said in front of reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included a single woman in her first cabinet and, following sustained pressure to increase the representation of women in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the re-establishment of December.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull might have on the Australian business sector.
Tuesday, the lobby groups in the business sector did not know how to manifest their enthusiasm more strongly when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's friars as prime minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see had been abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or he simply ended up in a negotiated suspension because of Abbott's political "crash-or-crash-through".
Representatives of interest groups spoke unanimously about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy public interest, to reach a political agreement and to do things well.
So what exactly does the country's biggest companies and their representatives expect from our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising.
Turnbull himself set as the starting target the free trade agreement with China.
In his first speech announcing on the media that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChAFTA) represented the central point of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticized the “economic shocks” of the Labour Party on that issue and expressed concern about the racist temptation of critics.
“In the context of ChAFTA, winners are numerically much more than losers,” he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes that he will win this debate.
Don Argus, the legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wishes to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising and negotiate with the whole senate.
The Minister for Small Enterprises, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could lead to some divergences with the business environment from the beginning.
The assessment of the effects shall apply to large mergers and other contracts in order to decide whether consumers will have to suffer due to the lack of competition.
It is called "effect assessment" because it takes into account not only the company's actions and intentions but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this assessment is drawn up is extremely important for the outcome.
Harper's competition law analysis recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to get away from smaller operators on the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and the great retail merchants.
Turnbull now understands that he wants the whole cabinet to think about what he'll do next.
CAA jumped to say that if Turnbull follows Harper's recommendations, consumers will have to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one who advised the new prime minister to have greater respect for the processes in the cabinet, which Turnbull seems to do and does so by leaving Bruce Billson, the minister for small businesses (which is on the side of Harper's recommendations) to support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers followed women between sixty and eighty years of age.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have reduced their “significant” probability of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplication table under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard thinks I've completely misunderstood arithmetic.
The negative character of the Empire said for Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think one time is equal to one.
"How to be equal to one?" he said.
If one or one does one, that means two has no value, as one or itself does not have effect.
One times two, because the square root of the four is two -- so what is the square root of the two?
It should be one, but we're told it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's teachers disagreed with his theory, so he gave up at the Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"You can't just close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics called "Terryology".
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassembled scissors, wire, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his theory "one time" and similar theories of his.
He said for the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, were spending up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The Rolling Stone editor described Howard's creations as "more complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional buildings linked to them with copper wire or magnetized wires."
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the American patent 20150079872 A1 ("Systems and methods for improved applications of construction bricks").
Also, the actor from "To the tracks of an idol" further says that Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would "make it crazy" if they saw Terryology.
"You know," he says, "I've been asking since I was three-four years old why does a bubble take round?"
Why don't you become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard also added that he hopes to change the whole course of learning.
“This will be the last century our children will learn that one time one makes one,” he said.
They won't have to grow in ignorance.
In twenty years now, they'll know that one or two do.
We are about to reveal a new truth.
True universal mathematics.
We'll check in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Printing
Tuesday, during the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, interpreting "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying her vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did good work by imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted versions of the "I Can't Feel My Face" at The Weeknd.
This week, Grande's name was still in the press.
On the same day she was also at "Good Morning America", where she opened the show with the Gogoese Lins incident.
Taco Bell hopes that the "Cantina" restaurants in which he will serve will become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On 22 September, the Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain will open a new location in the Wicker Park area of Chicago, offering a menu of aperitif tapas, a fresh painted by a local artist and even alcoholic beverages.
It is the first test location of the “Taco Bell Cantina” restaurants of the chain, which addresses young people, concentrated in ever greater numbers in the city centers.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6000 restaurants in the USA, has its roots mainly in suburbs and is associated with cheap food, quickly prepared, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average Taco Bell payment rating of 7 USD, the company used drive-through service and quick services to attract the number of customers needed to make profit.
But Taco Bell says that, in order to address the new generation that "looks for more central urban environments in which to live, work and have fun", the test locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
So you can do a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"You're not allowed," said to USA TODAY Neil Borkan, the Frenchman Taco Bell who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared with traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you can see the food at your own disposal" before it is ready, said the Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Also, wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will be served at the new location, following the recent example of many Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer "nightly" menus that include beer, wine and snacks.
One thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company said that another location Taco Bell Cantina will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing drive-through service and parking with an inner courtyard and a sales window.
These location changes, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the fast food chain restaurant wants to attract other types of customers outside those who are looking for fast food late at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when he opened more expensive Cantina and burritos menus to compete with Chipotle, the project being supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If they succeed, Cantina restaurants will be another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said that until 2022, he plans to open 2000 restaurants in the United States.
As Sandland said for AP, "a few hundred" of these will be like "Cantina".
They set up the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John is making a court for Putin
Russian president Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John on his phone Monday night, just a few days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss the ancient Russian legislation together.
The British, gay singer, declared, attempted to get a interview with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, one year after challenging this country's protests and supporting two concerts in 2013, during a turbulent period in the history of this state, following the adoption of controversial laws, which prohibit "gay propaganda" in the minority.
In 2014, in Sankt Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made in front of the fans the following statement: "Although I'm gay, I always felt welcome here in Russia."
If I wouldn't be honest about what I am, I couldn't make up these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for this, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist devalued that she wanted to meet Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information on the telephone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos has "singed" all in the ANRP folder
Businessman Dorin Cocos tries to save himself from a burning conviction, "sing" still in front of judges and detailing how millions of euros were distributed to former members of the ANRP Commission.
Audited yesterday at the Court of Cassation and Justice in the file in which he is tried with the son or Alin Cocos, the former boss of DIICOT Alina Bica and the former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Damages within the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was hit by the lightning of sincerity.
He recognized all the charges and told the judges how he helped businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of the damages of ANRP, instead seeking to be judged more quickly and to keep account of his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos showed that he had known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he was implicated with him after more real estate business.
He indicated that Sergiu Diacomatu met in 2010, and he told him that he was working at ANRP.
Later we found out that (Diacomatou, n.r.) is vice president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at the ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised him the money, 2.5 million euros, the money I told him I'd give him in several trances.
I also promised her political support, to stay in line.
"Diacomatu then told me to help, but he needs support," Dorin Cocos showed in the courtroom.
He also said that he later, through an acquaintance, came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Committee of Dispagubiri, who promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, I gave him five million euros.
I gave Dumitrean a million euros to Dragos Bogdan. I gave him 800,000 euros.
I specify that all this money was given to her in a trance, to make sure that the file was resolved.
"So I said to them, to solve the file, to put down the damages," Cocos said.
When asked why he got to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
For the second file, I got eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got 1.2 million euros left.
In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.
"Never spoke to this money or land," Cocos said.
He also pointed out that "it was notoriety that all the members of the ANRP understood before the meeting."
I didn't have the emotions that they won't give a positive vote.
All the functions were political in the ANRP, but I personally did not help the Diacomatou politics.
"I told him I only helped him politically to calm him down," Cocos finished his statement.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Premier Victor Ponta was at DNA yesterday for only five minutes, while he filed new documents in the file "Turceni - Rovinari".
Victor Ponta ran away to DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the prosecutor will receive it for a discussion on the margins of the file in which he is searched for false entries under private signature, charged with tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went from his own initiative to DNA, although the documents that could have been sent by counsel.
It wasn't like that, because the prosecutor didn't have time, the prime minister leaving after five minutes, while he left for the recording several documents.
I wanted to file (to file, n.r.) the European Court of Justice decision of 3 September, which explains what happens to service contracts.
I say we've been active, the prosecutor says we haven't, the European Court of Justice has told us to see both of us, because as long as the taxes have been paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is binding, certainly, for all the countries of the European Union, we do not have a case here," Prime Minister Victor Ponta said when he came out of DNA.
The Ponta also said that, from the point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply, if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call it back to hearings, but also to give him an answer to his requests, including the removal of the file.
John enjoys his warrant without a TV
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch television.
And you don't even own such a machine, since you pay your TV fee once with your energy bill.
But if you're the head of the state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is understood that the position of the President of Romania is also a reflection of everyday realities.
President Iohannis plunged every day into a total quiet in his office or from Cotroceni
Only, to the astonishment of his closest people from the Cotrocene Palace, Klaus Iohannis refused to have television in the presidential office.
And after he doesn't look at television - on any program, at least at TTL or Pro Sieben-, the president doesn't listen to radio stations and doesn't read newspapers.
In addition, it does not receive even "negative monitoring" that the predecessor, for example, asks with priority.
Instead, Johnis was happy to receive only the report with the news that put him in a positive light.
And in addition to this self-insolement of information, in which the only breeza is access to the facebook, much more serious is the blockage to which, through its passiveness, the head of the state imposes the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although it's been so bitter since its installation, Johnis hasn't yet signed the statements of loyalty of more than half the employees of the Presidential Administration.
Which becomes an increasingly serious problem, both humanly and legally.
Peace and quiet
Those in the presidential entourage are already clear as no one and nothing can ever ruin the "feng shui" in the head of the state.
Where is peace and quiet.
What's right, just after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when the ex-edile of Sibi asks the officials to present.
A custom that probably didn't get out of the time when he was driving the city's primary on Cibin.
And about the fact that Iohannis doesn't want television in the office has already been born countless legends, being already people at the Cotrocene Palace who have become prone to the option that the president would try to avoid its monitoring.
Especially since he doesn't have any radios.
Only at this rate will it be able to meditate as soon as in the dark, because lighting devices can hide the audio-video recording technique.
Just good.
Also another strangeness at the Cotrocene Palace is the delivery to the head of the state only of the "pzoitive monitoring" of the president's activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the chief of state will receive its content on the bio.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that it was prohibited to "negative monitoring" on the conditions in which, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a result of the night broadcasts on the television in which he was criticised, but required every morning, with priority, negative news.
That doesn't mean the museum that helped him to something, but that's what the gesture counts!
And at least he can never have the excuse that he was not well informed of alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed
Now, after all, love her and mystery why she doesn't want to watch Klaus Johnis on television.
Until then, more important would be to solve, regardless of the formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees from the Presidential Administration.
Who, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a statement of loyalty to the head of the state and who must bear and sign it.
Only since December and so far, Klaus Iohannis has not signed for confirmation at least half of these statements, although it has to happen within 30 days.
So hundreds of employees, representing over half the staff at the Cotrocene Palace, now have a uncertain situation.
Because, legally speaking, if the chief of state doesn't personally sign their statement, they should be given out.
Only that they all didn't get any negative opinion!
So, at one point, I can come whenever the Court of Auditors inspectors, who will find that, over half a year, so many hundreds of people have received their salaries at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
That until he decides and the president if he gives it out or confirms it on his posts, his decision being strictly his.
Authorities said that a teenager was in danger of an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S.
The ISIS-inspired plan of a teenager to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. was rather “in terms of aspirational order” than operational, confirmed a police source for Fox News on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August, when the law enforcement authorities debated the plan.
The plan is the same as the Texas Representative, Mike McCaul, the President of Homeland Security during an interview on Sunday, declared a source for Fox News.
"We monitor very carefully the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States," McCaul said at ABC's "This Week."
Pope Francisc was not mentioned as the specific target of the plan in a newsletter.
Joint information from the FBI and the Department for Internal Security of August 14, in which the adolescent was said to plan to use more attacks, firearms and explosives, with the aim of “a foreign demnity during a high-level event”.
In the bulletin it is mentioned that the minor has radicalized through social networks.
The adolescent may suffer from a mental illness, said a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving accurate details about the young man's disease.
Also on Sunday, McCaul acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called "single wolf" across the whole nation and mentioned that it was informed by the Secret Services about a "secret location" for the Pope's visit.
And with that comes a great security risk... yet, as the time approaches, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
The skeleton from the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, experts say
Irish archaeologists have revealed amazing details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of an old tree of 215 years.
Collooney's Fag, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, lighting up the macabre view of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish National Monument Service has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to dig and analyze the remains, thus discovering a fascinating story.
"He was killed violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services for FoxNews.com.
On the upper side of the chest has wounds caused by the knife. He has such a trace in his left hand, which suggests that he was trying to defend himself.
The skeleton is of a young man between 17 and 20 years of age.
The radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
“We can’t know if he was killed in battle or in a personal quarrel,” says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
"Probably she was buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd told FoxNews.com that who planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents testifying that there was a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of the discovery: the height of the young man.
"He had a mile of 77," says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means pretty much.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies are thinking about eating
National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent almost $1.5 million studying what small children think about food.
The project, called "The way in which babies and little children perceive food" is conducted by the University of Chicago and, so far, has determined that the little ones are not prepared to eat smooth food from other people or that they have trained other people.
According to the project funding, "adequate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritionally healthy diets."
There is evidence that the first food models of babies and young children have long-term consequences for the health of the whole of life.
The award for this study is that there is no research on how the baby is to eat.
“Despite the complexity and significance of the food selection, psychologists for the development of the child have made little attention to the study of how babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food, said the financier.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on choice and consumption of food to babies and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have “limited knowledge in the field of food”.
Children between three and six years of age “you know more about food than babies and young children,” but they are “extremely mofturous consumers”.
An actress who played in "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played in the television show "Star Trek: Voyager" was arrested in eastern Tennessee, accused of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that actress Jennifer Ann Lien, 41 years of age, who played Kes' role in the television show, is accused of two indecent exposure offences involving children under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.
Officers of the sheriff's office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on September 3 at Lien's residence in Harriman, where they say they found her empty under a blanket on the couch.
The officers said that Lien refused their requests to dress.
Harriman's chief of police, Randy Heidle, says that Lien was brought several counts of charges, including the aggravated bodily injury after the April incident in which he said that Lien had entered a police car with a personal car.
You still don't know if he has a lawyer.
Police identified the murdered victim found in the Epping forest
A man whose body in decay was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, 53-year-old Hidir Aksakal was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping Forest in north-eastern London.
The man of Turkish origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close links to the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
Last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis showed that he was killed, and the detectives say that his body was probably in the Epping forest for weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo of the metropolitan police said: “Mr. Aksakkal was well known locally as Boxer Cetin and we hope to find out from the Green Lanes community information to help us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a popular and crowded tourist resort, where there is a cafe and a lake for boat rides.
It's also surrounded by streets with heavy traffic.
I ask all those who have been in the area in the last few weeks and may have noticed some unusual or suspicious activity to come and talk to us.
Super Chief: Six Women Jangling Between Maternity and Service
Unlike any other country in the world, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, there is no centralized policy on maternity leave paid in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo's executive director Marissa Mayer announced that she was pregnant with twins, but he was going to take a very short maternity leave and "work" his free time, the 40-year-old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture that awaits the superwoman or nothing.
But is Mayer, herself a symbol of the top woman, to be responsible for unrealistic expectations?
How are other women leaders doing?
Seema Patel, lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Labour Standards Office, just got a job in the government in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss ignored her with unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," her boss said.
But if you're going to make a family for yourself in the future, you're going to pick up your vacation from now on.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't even get a maternity leave paid as part of her employment contract.
At the time, Patel was single and very focused on his career, and the family was the last thing he was thinking about.
But he listened to her boss's advice.
She avoided using her days of medical leave for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child two years ago, she had spent three months on pay leave.
Six months ago, when the second child was born, Patel could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of leave he took were entirely unpaid.
Patel says he didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but he has a problem with the structure of work.
“I find it very discouraging for anyone trying to have a family, ” she says.
Send a message: Your country doesn't put any value on becoming a parent.
Karen Choi, vice president of the Capital Group’s management firm, says that any woman who is and mother should be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the bond between motherhood and job as “a constant battle”.
The key to not suffocating is to have an “unbelievable family with you” and a babysitter and a babysitter, to accept that there are things you won’t be the best ("not everyone can be Martha at the interior setting") and simply go through it.
Choi says he took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two and a half months for the first and ending at six months for the last.
That makes it an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child is sick, he has fever, vomit, and you stay up all night to care for him and you know that the next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
But her company supported her and mentioned that the performance of her investment portfolio had not suffered at all.
When she entered the finance industry after the university, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same way, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
Women who quit the job, then start again don't have the same chances at top posts well paid, she says.
It is difficult to remain: “In the short term it is a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen.”
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me go further is that I would like to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example to her four children is what motivates the scientist and teacher Kelly Posner, 48 years old.
The children know that their mother helps, on their own, to save human lives.
Posner, founder and director of Columbia University's suicide risk assessment center, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "beauty objective" in terms of career and performance.
It's very important for women to think I can have a vision.
Most of them don't allow themselves to believe that," she says.
Once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar when she was pregnant in eight months.
She also helped technology, she says, because she can stop the car and answer the phone after she takes her children or respond to an e-mail on her way.
The twinkle between motherhood and an applicant career has been helped by an optimistic personality, oriented towards solving problems, she says. The ability to bring things to the end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33 years old, the Executive Director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says that making maternity and career work together only through private aid networks, such as bonds, is wrong.
“You shouldn’t be lucky or winning the lottery to succeed,” she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, the deficit health system and the lack of a paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't care about each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who have just been born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following the courses of law school, was born to his child while the first scholarship.
With a husband and a child based on the medical assistance offered by the scholarship, the job leader was able to take a maternity leave for only two weeks, and then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashion designer and mother of two children, says that fewer women will abandon their profession if they benefit more from social support, in the form of day-to-day care services from companies, maintaining the programmes set by common agreement and accepting that effective work does not mean staying over the program.
In the forefront of logistical constraints, says Mosko, there is the added pressure to activate in a domain where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of tastelessness ("mummy coat" is one of the most serious insults).
“ Imagine is part of our job to get you up or pull you down, ” she explains.
Mosko's "Permanent Negotiation" for its multiple roles to work harmoniously means to maintain its ec appearance and a beautiful bag in hand, from which, however, sometimes one-two-to-two-to-one.
If they remember that men are fathers, society could allow them to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York Housing Authority, who handles housing of over 400,000 New Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that maternity and career does not mean talking about "balance".
The notion of balance is a little wrong.
She looks more like a swinger," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom has only three months, she just took a seven-week maternity leave after she was born this year.
“It was a very important period for the agency,” she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take her paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program that meant leaving early or late, so that she could breast-feed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 (" cheaper than therapy"), is still breast-feeding.
At work, he tried to create a "friendly to parents" environment, in which delay due to a child is allowed, and the response to emails should not be sent out of the office.
"The concept and notion of family have changed and it changes a lot," Olatoye says.
"Family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that has to adapt.
Uturistic Russians say they tricked Elton John about a phone call from Putin
For Cynics it seemed too nice to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, to Sir Elton John, singer and activist for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss gay rights.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram where the Russian leader thanked him for addressing him about the problem, it immediately became clear that, whoever called him Monday night, certainly not Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humorous men admitted that they, not the president, had been the foreign voices from the other end of the talk.
“We thought it was unlikely that Putin would want to meet with him or call him, or at least not soon,” says Vladimir “Vovan” Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague, Alexei “Lexus” Stoliarov, was given as President’s spokesman Dmitri Peskov.
"Well, it seems that Elton John really waited for this phone, so he immediately thought it was really about a conversation with the right people we were giving us," he said for the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said, “Thank you, it was the surprise of the day.”
This day and this conversation were the most wonderful and lovely of my life.
In order to complete John's embarrassing situation, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not give statements on the pharynx speculations.
On the basis of the stories there are comments made by the singer on the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his "ridicial" attitude toward homosexuals while militating for LGBT rights in Kiev, especially criticizing a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
“I’d like to meet [in Putin], talk about it,” said John for BBC, saying that although the idea was “probably unrealistic,” it was still worth a try.
Then, on Monday evening, the singer sparked the mistrust of observers when she published a message on a social network, claiming that Putin answered his critics by taking the phone and calling him.
He said that “he was looking forward to meeting him [on the president] in the face to discuss LGBT equality in Russia.”
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the other end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for phone calls given in jokes many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks English well, played the role of Peskov and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told the journalists on Tuesday that Putin would "be prepared to meet Elton John and answer all his questions", but that no such requests were received from the singer at Kremlin.
Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, “especially because it is not entirely written in the right English.”
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written with even the errors of grass.
Even before the Russian duet declared its public farce, local media channels already suspected John was the victim of a joke.
Some users of the online environment had identified Krasnov as guilty, known for the farces of the phone politicians they record and post on his YouTube channel like Vovan222.
The phone calls to the public, then the publication of the recordings have become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many as the initiator of the genre, has developed his talent to make them the jokes of Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television imitating Anton Geraşchenko, the direct adviser of the Interior Minister, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Gerashenko so well that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomiski, more than six hours in more days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections that led to massive street protests following massive fraud reports.
Given Arkadi Dvorkovich, then President Dmitri Medvedev's adviser, he convinced the chairman of the election commission Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, his victims included former president USSR Mihail Gorbachev, mayor of Kiev and champion of box Vitali Klitschko and Russian sports minister Vitali Mutko, who tricked him into apologizing for the drunken behavior of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called the Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukaşenko, becoming the son of the Ukrainian leader fired, Viktor Yanukotrici.
It was so convincing that the person at the other end, whose voice resembled Lukashenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial assertion that he would like to talk to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
The Lieutenant Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with such an "irrelevant subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain his position.
The newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets opened an online poll for readers, in which 39% of respondents felt that Putin and John should meet, and 22% considered that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, over 3 million people die prematurely each year because of air pollution from outside, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal for heating homes and cooking, but research reveals that a similar alarming reason is agricultural emissions from Europe and the USA, where it is the main reason for these deaths.
The report warns that if no action is taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projections should draw an alarm signal for public health agencies all over the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, environmental health expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by the rain of the air are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
They cause stroke and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million deaths per year, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
The research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, e.g. from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause 3.4 million more deaths per year.
The new study, published in the newspaper Nature, is the first to highlight various sources of outdoor air pollution and estimated the number of premature deaths caused by them, taking into account road traffic, fossil-based power plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on different populations, including new information on how pollution affects China and India.
A third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-extinguishing fuels, such as wood and coal, for heating homes or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognised dangers.
The consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of the 645 000 annual deaths in India and a third of the 1.4 million annual deaths in China.
However, the research found that agricultural ammonia emissions had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the German Chemical Max Planck Institute, which led the research.
A fifth of global deaths are caused by these emissions, which mainly come from cattle, birds and pigs and from the overuse of fertilizers.
Amoniac reacts with traffic and industry exhaust gases and produces tiny particles, being the main reason of the deaths due to air pollution in the east of the US, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing a fifth of the dead, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
This caused only 5% of deaths globally, but the figure could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by the power plant, in particular by those operating with coal, was significant at global level, causing one of seven deaths.
In the US it is the main single factor, causing a third of the 55,000 deaths per year, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in the arid regions and with much dust, caused almost a fifth of the global deaths caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, being responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"Overlapping the high degree of pollution and the large number of inhabitants says their word about public health, but there is no longer any knowledge of pollution sources responsible for premature deaths," says Jerrett.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at global level.
It is now assumed that all particles are as toxic.
But if fuel burning is more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, Jerrett says "discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both from scientists and policy makers."
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmosphere specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “Study really stresses the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in the very populated areas of Asia.”
A statement by Victor Ponta tenses more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the first novel talks about attitudes that remind of Nazism
The relations with Hungary, already tensioned by the announcement of the construction of a fence on the border with Romania, after that on the Sardinian border, have experienced a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who charged the authorities in Budapest on Monday that they treat refugees "with a bat and inserted".
Hungarian Diplomacy reacted hard by talking about "extremists and liars", but not even Victor Ponta stood down and accused local government officials of being "a shame" for Europe.
Note that it is not for the first time that Ponta tries to tension the Roman-Hungarian relations through declarations made in delicate or electoral moments.
It all started from a statement made on Monday by Victor Ponta, trying to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem you have of our logistics ability to treat those people like people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbors, with bricks and inserts.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu put himself in the forefront of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenofob sentiment.
It's very good to have a debate, but we have a job to solve the problem.
"We'll treat those people like us," said Victor Ponta on Monday, quoted by the Truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the integration of refugees, but Chehia was recently in the center of critics after writing numbers on the hands of migrants in several trains, in a gesture that remembered the procedure used by the Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners in the concentration ponds.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian MTI news agency, taken by Magyaridok.hu, that the internal political crises that have shaken Victor Ponta's position make him make statements "extremist and lying".
The Romanian businessman from Budapest was summoned to provide explanations, informaze Mediafax, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta recently made incorrect statements about how Hungary handles the immigrant crisis," says the Hungarian Foreign Ministry.
Levente Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in MAE Hungarian, expressed "surprise" in connection with "the constant attempts of Victor Ponta to save his controversial moral position by anti-ungary lies", stressing the diplomacy of Budapest.
"I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives - but read the story below and you will understand the indignation that I feel, as a European man and citizen, the face of the mentality and attitudes that Europe saw only in the 1930s-40s!!" wrote Ponta, on his Facebook account.
He claims that, like other European politicians, he has "duty" to attract attention and punish "the constant behaviour of government officials at the highest level in Hungary" who are "a shame for the culture and values of the European Union" by "anti-like attitudes", "trait of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"Sarma principata, laws aggressive, imprisonments and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are policy makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees flee!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values", and "what we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!".
During the series, Ponta was invited to Antenna 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea named Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta asked what would happen if the Hungarian military caught and shot or killed some children or women in a speech in which he made more reference to Nazism.
In the dispute, UDMR president Kelemen Hunor also intervened, who considers that the Roman authorities should not have a "feeling approach" in connection with Hungary's intention to build a border fence.
The UDMR leader states that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or the citizens of Rome, he points out that the fence might even help our country not become an intense route passed by migrants who want to reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to point out, to say, that we don't have to hysteria, take this whole thing as something against Romania, and we don't have to use it to make things worse, anyway, not good relations between the two governments, because it's not the case.
I think any sentimental approach, the visceral isn't right.
"We must see the rational part, see why we got here, and we must know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, Roman citizens and does not prevent free movement between the two states, within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The West ignored in 2012 Russia's offer to take Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia has proposed more than three years ago the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, according to an official high-ranking involvement at that time in negotiations with closed doors between the western countries and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
Former President of Finland and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Martti Ahtisaari, said the Western powers have not benefited from the proposal ever since.
From 2012 to the present, tens of thousands have died and millions have been forced to flee the country, giving birth to the most serious refugee crisis since the end of the second world war.
Ahtisaari held discussions with the representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation, and China), in February 2012.
He also stated that during the discussions, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churchin, offered a plan that included among others and Assad's proposal to give up power at some point after the beginning of peace treaties between regimes and oppositions.
He proposed three things:
One -- we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we must initiate a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
"Three - we must look for an elegant way for Assad to withdraw," Ahtisaari told the Russian ambassador.
Insa, he also said Ahtisaari, the United States, the United Kingdom and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator was following his fall that they ignored the proposal of the Russian ambassador.
"It was a missed opportunity in 2012," Finland's former president continued.
Russia officially supported Bashar al-Assad over the four-and-a-half years of war, insisting that his release could not be a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow has recently begun to send troops, tanks and military flight equipment to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to defeat the extremists of Islamic State.

Antenna 3 suggests that "all these live broadcasts from the country and abroad, campaigns, daily news have been and are possible through a constant, assumed financial effort, which has assumed a permanent networking and quality focus."
We managed to support ourselves, under the conditions that offline and online distributors did not contribute anything to the content offered.
The announcement comes under the conditions in which the news television program is accessible on the basis of subscription and on the online platform Antena Play, where, moreover, the most often exclusive and recordings of the Antene broadcasts have been accessible.
Reports show that populations of marine animals and plants have been halved in the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis facing marine animals and plants is documented in a study that states that marine species around the globe, including those essential for the safety of human food, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures in several directions at the global oceanic ecosystem are combined and creating a frequency of difficulties for almost all marine creatures, says WWF's "Live Blue Planet" report.
Coral reefs are seriously at risk of decline (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and large grass, which depend on many other species, have experienced a significant decline, while the entire population of commercially valued fish, such as macro and tuna, have declined by three quarters compared to the 1970s, the report shows.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened by extinction up to the middle of this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to deteriorate, as a result of the increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, causing a direct proportional increase in the level of carbonic acid in the sea.
"Healthy seas are a source of extraordinary natural beauty and wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, head of marine policy adviser to WWF-UK, who contributed to the preparation of the report.
"By overfishing, which damage coastal habitats, and without solving the problem of global warming, we resemble the seeds of an ecological economic disaster," said Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of the published scientific literature, but also on the indexes of the living planet, a database maintained by the Zoological Society of London, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It investigated a wide variety of marine species, fish, sea turtles and sea cucumbers - an animal similar to a worm, with rough skin - up to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the algae have decreased by about 30% in the last century, while the total mangrove areas have decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp and other forms of aquaculture.
During one generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
Deep changes are needed to ensure an abundant oceanic life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, general director of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have occurred in fishing species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 out of 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family - macro, tuna and sardines - have decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without giving a sign of recovery, says the report.
We are in a fishing race that could end up depriving people of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
Excess fishing, destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, which are based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our struggle to eradicate poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, the scientific director of the ZL, said: “These alarming figures prove how quickly people change plants and animals in the ocean and represent a clear warning about the problems we may face as a result.”
Large grass: deep underwater “passions”, which catch rich sediments in minerals and stabilize the seabed.
Over the last century, the cover area has decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Almost 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many may disappear during this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to deteriorate.
Deep habitats: very little is known about the deepest areas of the ocean, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by global marine changes.
Steven Gerrard denies the racism charges that would have been brought to him by his former partner from Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage in his autobiography in "My Story", serialized by the Daily Mail, Gerard criticizes the Senegalese player saying that "he's not really interested in football" and that he's the colleague he liked the "less one" in the 17 years spent at the club.
In response, Diouf would have responded to Gerrard on the Senegalese radio station Futurs Medias Group, with quotes attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked the people of colour".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any accusation of racism brought by him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who had also made his opinion public and before bad about Diouf, criticized the attitude and the degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons in Liverpool as an example of how things can go on their way," he writes.
“It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and doesn’t care about Liverpool at all,” he continued.
For example, the way in which he spitted out a huge, vexed fleg in a Celtic fan in a Uefa Cup game at Parkhead in March 2003 is an evidence of his contemptuous and arrogant behavior.
Diouf turned out to be a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most notorious night being the one on Celtic Park.
The late Senegalese officer was interrogated by the police after the episode of the spit and fined with his salary in return for two weeks at the club, with an amount of 60 000 pounds being donated to a humanitarian organization at Celtic's election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerard describes Diouf as being lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard wrote.
I felt he wasn't just willing to make every effort to help Liverpool come back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at the Malaysian Sabah club, publicly criticized Gerrard and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerard "egoist" and claimed that no one on Anfield likes the player who led the team to the League of Champions victory in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "gelos".
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't touch the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the chief's status, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the world of football, the biggest football experts have framed me between the first seven players at the World Championship and between the first 100 players of the century.
Many great players don't have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go in other countries, I am venerated, while Gerrard is dismissed every time he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From hero to professional dancer: Alek Skallados' fast way to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Skartados does not only play the role of the hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, equally discreet and modern, tell the producers.
“We’re always looking for the most popular of the time,” said Deena Katz, executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find his impression after that.
He's charming.
He's got something special.
Before he was competing at the famous show - but just a few weeks before - Skartados got into the international press after he took a great deal of action.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 on a train full of travelers going from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a potential terrorist.
Later, Skartados, 22 years old, a saint in the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a phone call from President Obama, a Twitter message from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although it may have anticipated a few local appreciations - on Friday, at Sacramento, a parade took place for the young man - was not expected to be so positive or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
“I wouldn’t have thought in a million years that I would receive this offer,” Skartados confessed on Saturday, in a break from the dance rehearsals with his partner Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy to me.
Even though before the show of Monday night he admitted that he was "easy" he acted as a professional at his first foxtrot, getting scores that brought him almost to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best performances of the series.
Katz and the executive producer at "DWTS" Rob Wade said they wanted to keep a free place in the show for the competitors invited on the last hundred meters, such as Skartados, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation, who played a gun attack on a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance contest.
He searched for social networks, found family members and sent messages to Skartados.
When it appeared at "Good Morning America" to tell about the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the sister program at ABC to avoid going through all the media dams.
He supported his "five-minute pleasure", then he eagerly waited to find out if Skartados would agree to participate in "DWTS".
"One time everything was very uncertain, because that's so different from what he's doing," Katz confessed.
A little while ago, the fight in Afghanistan, and now I was asking him if he's in charge of dancing.
Skallados, who is in a short stay at the National Guard, had not even seen a whole show until recently.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be just out of the picture.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in hand: Noah Galloway, veteran of war, with hand and leg amputated.
They encouraged Skartados to call Galloway, the fan's favorite competitor and finalist of last season, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz’s unstoppable “purchase ” and“ insistent messages, ” she said.
“Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army would look and how the image of my friends would be protected,” Skartados said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Skallados, a great sports lover and history lover, never danced before, and Arnold testified in interviews that he is trying to make him relax again and give up the military position quite rigid.
But Katz says he's confident that he'll adapt and that the spectators will react positively.
He'll get a lot of love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he's done.
"How can you not support it?" said Katz.
But that's only gonna take a few weeks.
To go on, he has to dance.
Skartados, who is a bachelor and wants to become a cop, says that until now he's had fun in this completely unknown environment of his.
The program represented the toughest fight, being required to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the moments when it was acclaimed on the media and the various premiere ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the U.S. immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with the family.
"This lasted about a day and a half," he said.
In total, I stayed at home for four days.
There is a risk in catching a person who attracts media attention, but it is not common to be in the spotlight, said executive manufacturer Wade.
And the show wants to make sure the competitor manages and has fun.
"Pression is great and we want participants to have a nice experience," Wade said.
"I wouldn't want Alek ever to say, "Aoleu, what did I get into?"
Let's keep his fists having fun.
McRib from McDonald's back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-costs to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of the country's McDonald's franchisees offer this season specialty.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib sandwich.
"At McRib's 2015 promotion, there are about 8,000 restaurants," said McDonald's spokesman Lisa McComb for The Times in an e-mail.
In the United States there are just over 14,300 restaurants of this fast food.
But according to McComb, the individual French owners decide whether or not they will serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they consider they want their local customers.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain his ingredients last year, with a video showing reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year at McDonald's restaurants participating.
There is also a web site with locations where McRib (unfiltered at McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search the nearest place to serve this sandwich.
But a quick search on the site shows that the nearest McRib restaurant in Los Angeles is in Sevastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.

Keith Richards understands that new Rolling Stones records would be prepared
Keith Richards is back in the spotlight with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, and the other members of the Rolling Stones band might join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others at Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - recently met in London and made “clear plans for recordings,” as he says.
Tuesday evening, Richards spoke in the ICONS series at iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the first LP of the band after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the band wasn't at all inactive.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and performed in several small concerts in L.A., including representatives at Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
In the latter, they reinterpreted the classical LP of 1971, "Sticky Fingers".
Richards was particularly busy this year, working with the documentary Keith Richards: Under the Influence, scheduled to be released on September 18 on Netflix.
This year, he released his third solo album "Crosseyed Heart" in a five-year career.
Randy Lewis from The Times described Richards' new album in an interview with the guitarist: “As always, Richards’ harsh voice is a rather kinder than distinguished instrument....
But Richards is excited in all 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards says the band will most likely enter the studio after the U.S. tournament from the beginning of next year.
He didn't give any other details, but, judging by the last concerts, the band is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Batiman about childhood, maturity and “The Family Fang”
Jason Batiman already went through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them look much simpler than they actually were.
Once a child actor on television shows like "Silver Spoons" as an adult reaffirmed himself as an inexpressive typical player in the "Situation of Crisis" TV series and in movies like "Cummar Chiefs".
The first film he worked on as director was very acidic "Bad Words" comedy, in which he also played.
The film was nominated at the International Film Festival in Toronto in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film he plays Nicole Kidman and Baman, in the role of the brothers with problems.
The film has as its subject a festival looking for American distribution.
Many of the reviews of the books have considered it a comedy with strong emotional attempts; the film reinterprets the story, putting more emphasis on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bamanek says that he always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen the book like this," he confessed.
In the book, the subject and themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was dealing with a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The World Premiere of Monday evening received an introduction from the programme director of the festival, Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm in particular from the sitcom "The Hogan Family" of the late 1980s and the early 1990s, to whom Baman worked. "I have not met too many fans "Hogan Family", Baman said when he got on stage.
However, the few episodes that he directed from that sitcom brought Batiman, now 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new movie has a family named Fang in the center.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their shows, for example by setting up a bank robbery with acadelas or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with a certain fame, although she is known for public scandals rather than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and journalist of magazines trying to get famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious surroundings, Annie and Baxter suspect it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the story of the children who want to evolve into an adult life was directly and deeply reflected in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical one," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10, with parents as managers, and this film has many elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun one.
“It’s a story that I feel connected and I understand deep down,” he added, “and although I didn’t try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with an untraditional childhood.”
The project started with Kidman, and she made the film, who got the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, he was co-opted Lindsay-Abaire, who adapted his own "Treat to reality", in which Kidman played.
Bateman confesses that he accepted the chance to direct the film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production "Photograph 51", did not take part in the premiere of Monday.
The reader of the book was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Batiman's film "a clever and caustic adaptation" that "of the types of clichés far too exploited of the dysfunctional family and conceals the mission, sometimes of a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet-sitter, incisive and usually very dark."
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very rough portrait" and noted that Batiman "shows visible progress and a higher maturity as film director with this smart, structured but never too narrow or mechanical adaptation."
After the Monday screening, when Bateman and Walken took the stage for the question session, the audience ovated the Walken Multibit.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that “I was impressed every day.
I couldn't believe the ease with which he changed the directorship of the film, which is very difficult, and the actor in the scenes.
His concentration is indeed amazing.
In a certain scene of dialogue, Bateman stands on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the bay, only a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and sees more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine Batiman the actor talking to Batiman the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I find it incredibly interesting to run movies," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to take advantage of me as an actor.
Having the privileged position of being the one responsible for creating all the experiences for the public, not just one tool in that orchestra, to be an actor, is a complete thing.
Without counting on that... actor wants a first plan.
During the question and answer session, Bateman testified that, after reading the script, he immediately thought of Walken for Caleb's role, but also of Carter Burwell's composer for the sound column.
Known primarily for the long friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell also composed the soundtrack for two other films at the Toronto festival: the animation film "Anomalisa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legend Gangsters", Brian Helgeland's interpretation of the English gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the soundtrack for Todd Haynes' "Carol".
“Works with elongated tones or obtained are very interesting to me,” Bamane says, giving more explanations on Tuesday.
Sail among those shades and guide the harmonious and somewhat elegant audience from one to one to the next, throughout the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate through the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Batiman made yet another bold step, both as director and actor, in a career dominated by reinvention and decision, a mix of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bateman confessed when he finished introducing his film to the world premiere of Monday, "Well, bad, he came out exactly as I wanted."
The festival wants as at Oscars about the story of Boston Globe about Pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 to the loto?
An X-LOTTO ticket worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for one month.
The unregistered ticket to the X-Lotto extraction was purchased from the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd on Saturday, August 15.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, there were 16 other winning entries in all of Australia, which divided their unique prize fund of the estimated X-Lotto of $4 million.
SA Lotterias asks all those who bought tickets at X-Lotto from the Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them out as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the extraction of the X-Lotto 3555 on Saturday, August 15, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, Manager Ingle Farm Lotterias Kiosk, says he is looking forward to getting the good news that the one who won the big prize checked his X-Lotto ticket.
“I have tried hard to spread the news, because a person is our winner and has no idea at all,” she said.
Criminalist detectives search the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where was last seen the missing man Daniel Hind
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of his journey the night he was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search the house since her brother's disappearance.
"I was hoping they'd search the house, we weren't informed they'd do it," she said.
Miss Hind further says that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have many other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Anyway, we want him at home and put an end to the stories.
Until 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 km of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 miles of new highways and repair 17,000 miles of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of the work for the highways Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina, all part of the pan-European transport corridor, is among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure increased safety on roads and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for trafficking in cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the plundering of Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgarian national legislation was restored to fit the new context, placing the emphasis on banning cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in particular the Directorate-General for Organized Crime (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and illegal selling of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said that Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, the recent studies have placed it in the third place, after Italy and Greece, in the top of trafficking in objects and cultural goods.
Bulgarian Minister of Internal Affairs further pointed out that trafficking in cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has expanded, being described as an extremely serious war crime.
He insisted that concerted and decisive measures are needed to stop the intentional destruction of history.
Director General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, noted that footage of the illegal archaeological excavations in Syria shows that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
The participants at the Wednesday conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must join in order to stop illegal trafficking in cultural goods in the war - torn country.
Rocketdyne Aerojet says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc stated that it is expected to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will soon be banned, but the date could be changed if it does not receive sufficient funds from the U.S. government.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to make statements on the fact that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture with equal shares for rocket launches by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say that the auction sum is a strategic move of the Aerojet to defeat its rival Blue Origin, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, which develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan rocket.
ULA says the Blue Origin engine program is about two years before the AR-1 engine from Aerojet, a statement that Aerojet contradicts.
The work on new engines became a priority after US lawmakers approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for launching military or spying American satellites after the annexation of the Ukraine Crimea region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck states that Aerojet tests engine hardware equipment, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to match both the Atlas 5 ULA rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine and the new Vulcan rocket that develops ULA and costs about $1 billion.
Aerojet says it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a completely new engine and rocket, as is currently going to be ULA.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet planned to start testing large-scale engines in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be postponed if the company did not receive sufficient funds from the Air Forces in contracts expected at the end of the first semester of the 2016 fiscal year, which began in October.
She further claims that the whole company was anxious to see how the Air Force would share a funding of about 160 million dollars between rival competitors.
He also says that Aerojet was thinking of trying other private engine financing options, but did not provide details.
Competition from the Air Forces is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the financing, and the Air Forces cover two-thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technologies), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies, have self-financed their engine creation process and say they are not necessarily looking for government funding.
AB InBev beer manufacturer plans a merger worth 275 billion USD with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the largest beer-producing company in the world, approached rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) with regard to a levy that would form a colossus that would produce a third of the total amount of beer in the world.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately $275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev's dominance in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, but also with their Asian beer factories.
"The true attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also some places in Asia and Latin America," said analyst Andrew Holland of the General Society.
AB InBev and other top beer companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weak spots in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the company on the second place worldwide and the producer of over 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said Wednesday that he was informed by the intention of AB InBev to make an offer to him, which must happen at the latest by 14 October, according to British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its policy of reducing marketing costs, previously orchestrated the purchase of Burger King, Ketchup Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A nearby source of SAB mentioned that it's too early to say what he's going to do, as they didn't get any offer.
“At this point, we are waiting and deciding,” the source said.
Speculations concerning mergers, which would most likely cause concern about the breach of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have been circulating for many years.
The time of the approach, after more than a decade of procurement by AB InBev, follows a decrease of approximately 15% of the price of SABMiller shares from August.
"It's exactly the moment they were waiting for," said Analyst Phil Gorham at Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least $40 (62 USD) for SAB Miller action, maybe even £45, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to $130 billion, which would also include SABMiller's debt.
This would be the most significant transaction of the year 2015, which is already announced a record year after the 2008 financial crisis in terms of the sum of the transaction, and one of the largest purchases since 1980 here.
The SAB shares have drawn from 19.9% to 36.14 pounds, giving it a $90 billion grant capitalization.
AB InBev actions reached 6.4%.
Rivali Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could look for another fusion as defense strategies, as happened in the previous year when it was offered to buy Heineken, but it failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottleneck with Coke (KO.N) and in recent weeks there has been the suspicion of a combination with Diageo or the Australian Coca-Cola Amatel (CCL.AX) beverage firm.
The overall rate on the beer market of AB InBev, the producer Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 211% in 2014 while SABMiller was 15%, according to the experts in the Plato Logic industry.
AB InBev intends a ratio between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) twice from the present 2.5.
It is possible to achieve the objective in 2016, the most realistic date at which the transaction could be concluded, so that it would have to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought the company that produced Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with 52 billion dollars, the biggest ice-money acquisition in history at that time. he let the report grow more than 5 times.
Such a big climb would allow them to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
Families that control AB InBev have a little more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders from SABMiller are the manufacturer of Altina cigarettes (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Others refused to give statements that AB InBev had been approached, but on 9 September, her financial director, Billy Gifford, said at an analysis conference that he regularly assesses the investment in SABMiller and that "this time we believe that maintaining assets is in the interests of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, head of European investment, equity, to Allianz Global Investors, who has actions in both companies, says AB InBev has faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of small debt revenues reaches some 15%.
But we believe that the profit gained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage of 8%, after 10 years," Dwane said.
In the case of any combination there are significant weights related to the breach of competition rules, in particular in the United States, where companies hold about 70% of the beer market.
"Economys that could be done at distribution operations are large, and the footpaths related to the breach of competition rules are even bigger," said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent of the company's shareholding held by SABMiller in accordance with the operating agreement governing it.
A change of control to SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get another 8 percent and appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, with his headquarters in Denver, would have the right to the first and last offer for the remaining 50 percent.
A Molson spokesman refused to comment on whether the company was interested in a bid, but Molson's actions increased by more than 12 percent, to their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is the CR Snow partnership of SABMiller with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao in China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that the combined group could hold 28% of the global market after the divestments.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accused a former Air Force pilot that he would have helped Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would have subsequently donated funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, said Wednesday police officers for Reuters, in a rare case to those who help finance activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of injured Taliban militants, at a hospital in the eastern city of Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in a May attack on a bus with members of the Muslim minority and ismaelien, after which 45 people died, said for journalists the Senior Police Officer Naveed Khawaja from the Department for the Combat of the Territory of the Province.
He will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has funded the Afghan Taliban more, we are still conducting research to see if he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him is someone else," the officer said.
"Hamed also provided financial assistance for AQIS," he said, referring to Al Qaeda's organization on the Indian Subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, which face activism, corruption and murder.
After, in December, the Taliban prisoners massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to undermine activism.
There were tough attacks, while the army also went further in tribal regions outside the law of the border with Afghanistan.
But militant groups remain a threat, and many have followers from Pakistani cities that are under the control of very weak police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52 years of age, used to preach at a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Housing Authority.
His public sermons were moderate, but in particular the encouragement of radicalism, the police said.
He studied at the Pakistan Air Force College in Sargodha and left Pakistan Air Force in 1998, said another security officer for Reuters under anonymity.
Later he entered the paint and chemical industry.
Rapper Rick Ross rejected his copyright application for "Everyday I'm hustlin"
The New York rapper Rick Ross cannot claim his copyright for the words 'Everyday I'm hustlin', decided by an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO musical group, who sold shirts with a similar verse, 'Everyday I'm shufflin'.
In a decision published on Tuesday by the Miami Federal Court, district judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross' slogan, prominent part of his debut landmark in 2006, "Hustlin'", is a short expression for which the courts have mentioned several times that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' court ruling weakens the process of violating the copyright that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, challenged LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the two electropops in Los Angeles, made up of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own famous 2010 songs "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflin".
The hip hop star said the LMFAO song is "an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of the Hustlin' song."
He also sued Kia Motors for the use of the song "Party Rock Anthem" in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright by selling t-shirts and other products with the shufflin' slogan.
In Tuesday's ruling, Williams says that "Hustlin'", as a song, is protected by the law of copyright.
But Ross' three-word slogan is made up of ordinary words and cannot have copyright, she said.
The judge compared it with other famous music versions of the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'," saying it's "a short expression, which all courts unanimously declared as impossible to place under copyright."
The judge did not decide whether the song of the band LMFAO is an unauthorized copy of "Hustlin'".
The process is scheduled for October.
The lawyers of Ross and LMFAO could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al., at the U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, Nr.

Dr Carson is approaching Trump in the most recent presidential survey of the Republican Party
According to the latest presidential survey for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson is approaching the bomb leader Donald Trump in preliminary republican elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped into seven-point polls.
After 27% of Trump's support in the latest CBS/New York Times poll, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, arrives in the second place with 23 percent, followed by Bush, TV star Mike Huckabee, Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with 6%.
Support from Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, governor of Ohio John Kasich and former executive director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, in single-digit numbers.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and the one who takes the Bush family standards further, fell by seven percentage points in a month, while the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker fell by eight points.
In the last survey, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson drew greater support than Trump among college graduates (29% compared to 21%), while Trump is ahead of Carson in the preferences of non-university voters (30% compared to 19%).
Trump is supported more by men than by women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents said that they were determined to support in their state's preliminary elections.
Those who said I know who they're going to vote with are twice as supportive of Trump than Carson.
It's still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters for preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey conducted between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday before a presidential republican debate.
Carson's ascension to this poll reflects that of Senator de Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of Democrats to the president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The last follow-up of the presidential nominations of the CBS shows that Sanders climbed by 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, respectively, in New Hampshire, among the voters who were Democrat for preliminary reasons.
A specialist in ethics claims that sexual robots should be banned
A leading ethical specialist in the robotics industry launched a campaign calling for a ban on the development of sexual robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, robotics expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
“Sex thefts seem to be an increasingly important topic in the robotics industry, and models that inspire the way they look, which roles they will have, are very disturbing,” she said for BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
He's inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology," she said for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to increasing the degree of sexual exploitation.
Although the sexual robots that are now manufacturing are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that these are the first step towards something more sinister.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it from the front.
Certainly, industry seems to be getting ahead.
A few years ago, the company producing True Companion's inflatable dolls launched Roxxxy, the "first sexual robot in the world".
However, concern about the potential dangers posed by artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among major industry representatives.
Even this spring, the executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote of “the risk that in five years something really dangerous will happen.
In an interview with BBC in December last year, the physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that “the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race”.
United Kingdom welcomes the first refugees from Syria - RT UK
In the coming days, Great Britain will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war route, the Interior Minister Theresa May announced.
They will receive assistance under the extended reinstallation programme of the government.
Refugees seeking asylum arrive from camps on the border with the country of the end of war.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Minister of Internal Affairs said that the government "operates quickly" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom it is imperative that the assistance and support they need already be laid down.
I know that the honourable members and the general public want to learn more about the number of persons and the date on which they are expected to arrive.
May mentioned that the government must also make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when they arrive.
I must point out that the level of expansion requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything is done properly.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister, Richard Harrington, will continue to keep up-to-date with the Chamber in this regard.
But I am pleased to tell the Chamber that we are waiting for the first wave of refugees in the coming days and are working quickly to plan more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew the wrath of parliamentarians and militants when he unveiled the plan for the government's refugees, many of whom felt that the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron said in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom “will rise to the height of its moral responsibility” and will receive 20,000 refugees from the camps in the Middle East until the following general elections.
He added that refugees will not automatically receive complete asylum, but a humanitarian status that allows them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics have noted that the figures were only 12 refugees a day, and the former Liberal Democrat Parliamentarian Paddy Ashdown said the measures were “depositors”.
Further, Ashdown revealed that the children included in this scheme are to be deported when they are 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
Important public figures and personalities have also condemned the measures.
In a joint letter, great names such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said that the response to the crisis is "too little, too late".
“It is a responsibility to share with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of countries close to the conflicts that drive people out of their homes,” they wrote.
The heading is being remedied on the global insecurity fund - RT Business
The Russian Ruble strengthened on Wednesday, being traded with 65.66 compared to the US dollar and with 73.98 compared to the euro at the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency earned seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say that the return of the ruble occurred due to the reaction of investors to the current disturbances of the global market produced by China's weights, the possible increase in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve and the exaggerated reaction to cheap oil.
Brent's rates increased by 61 on Wednesday, reaching 48.36 USD per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 more cents, at $45.31 per barrel.
MORE MULT CITIZENS: most likely, interest rate will increase in the U.S. by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is possible that volatility will say its word, fuelled by uncertainty about China and the moment of growth of the federal interest rate, which will continue to tone for oil and rube prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, an expert in emerging market monetary policy strategies, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began to buy rubles.
Global markets are waiting at their mouth for the Federal Reserve Thursday decision, whether or not the interest rate will increase.
Markets believe that this will not happen what could be the first nine-year increase in the interest rate of the US and have traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together in the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the U.S. government and companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephony company on the development of a database that allows drone pilots to book air space blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Collaboration is the result of a very widespread anxiety about the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial planes.
A new Forrester report describes the potential negative effect in living colors.
“Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in dense urban areas such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco,” notes research.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to Detta O'Cathain, a baroness in the House of Lords, the concern has increased on the background of reports on events at the limit of the production of an accident and the operation of drones over football stadiums, close to nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
"In the last two years, over 400 calls to the metropolitan police have been related to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
Which is the solution: to build a system that targets all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 meters, regardless of whether they are driven by commercial pilots or amateurs.
"As more and more small drones carry out commercial flights to low altitudes, beyond the level of pilot visibility, or even completely autonomous flights, it is necessary some air traffic management infrastructure to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, for example the delivery of packages in cities," she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as the design of the air space, methods of avoiding adverse weather and wind conditions, congestion management, route planning and redirection by methods similar to the rules set out for road traffic, such as signalizers and bandages.
They are expected to have a functional prototype until 2019.
The drone industry is setting off to explode in the European Union over the next years.
"We already see small and innovative EMS companies in the United Kingdom that use this technology with significant effects in the energy, agriculture and media industries," says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 permits for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Dislike button: why he wants Facebook to know what makes you sad
"A Look Back" works similarly, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for many users inside the virtual borders of Facebook, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, a empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge value of Facebook - about USD 240 billion after the last statistic - is due to the amount of unimaginable consumer data it owns.
Every interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable picture of complex, in a permanent update, about your person and the preferences you have.
This is valuable first for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to carefully choose which people to see ads on Facebook, selecting those who are most interested in their products.
A empathy button adds another set of data and, of course, opens a door for another type of advertising agents to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who ‘ appreciate’ a national football team, charities and promoters want to address those who, for example, ‘ empathize’ with the refugee crisis.
It will also likely change what you see at Noutés.
Facebook uses incredible intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that huge content universe you could see in the smallest stream you actually see.
This algorithm essentially depends on what you considered interesting in the past and, above all, on what you liked.
There is no doubt on Facebook that many interesting posts, but unfortunate ones do not enter the algorithm, because people do not feel that they should appreciate it.
But if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it might take the decision to remove this kind of post from Newties.
Facebook has conducted in the past experiments to understand how what you see in Newties affects your emotional state and, above all, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
The representatives of the academic environment call this “emotional contamination” and, although it sounds fatal, it is probably only a simple attempt on Facebook (and published, with their agreement) to better understand how their platform works and whether they can adjust algorithms to distribute more elements.
What will happen with the empathy button remains at Facebook latitude.
The real habit is how the decision of a single company to add one button to its services can produce so many speculations.
The reason that this happens may be that the decisions taken by Facebook - either involve the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that operate hidden - have deep consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of life in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and one that has a constant struggle for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions it takes, including regarding new buttons, will be the ones considered best to remain on the surface in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with that and soon they'll have a button for it.
Biometric bracelets can anticipate crises in people with autism
During ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team established that the body's signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, thus giving the assistants the opportunity to take the right steps.
Kids with autism we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say it hurts his head or that "there's too much noise" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body transmits to us, and it's necessary to do this in a gentle and unintrusive way.
For example, simple viewing of colors in an application can show the level of agitation. Red can be used to warn about a change of behavior, and blue for lack of interest, giving the assistant the understanding that the person is bored and needs encouragement.
The data in the bracelets can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping the caregivers understand the overall picture of how the person responds to different situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to make it very clear that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology to be specific for autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of client services at the Wirral Austic Society, who will present technology at the 2015 Autech conference on autism and technology from Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that you can bring as their life support technology. Now, apps for iPad give, on your own, a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help the kids learn how to play hide and hide.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can truly change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charitable organisation for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and are also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria “in the coming weeks”
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch aerial attacks on the Isis targets in Syria, announced on Wednesday the government, just a few days after President François Hollande said the intervention was a "necessary".
France will launch the first air raids on the Islamic State in Syria jihadist group “in the coming weeks,” said defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Wednesday.
The French air forces are conducting reconnaissance missions in Syria on September 8, and the attacks will follow “the following weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets,” Le Drian said for France Inter radio station.
Le Drian declared Tuesday in parliament that the Islamic State made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
“In the Great village there is a very powerful offense, and if it succeeds, it could destroy the one we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or the rest of it,” he said.
France is part of a coalition led by the United States, which has been bombarding the Isis positions in Iraq for one year, but Holland has changed the strategy last week to extend the actions in Syria, under conditions of political pressure is built up on the fund of the jihadist threat to which France faces.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf have already been involved in attacks on Isis militants in Syria.
IOS 9 commercial lock feature will make your phone even faster
The latest version of iOS 9 is released on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying about online publishers - is the ability to easily block ads while browsing the web.
The new feature will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, advertisements, pop-up windows and other types of advertising during the use of the Safari browser mobile version of Apple.
On the test, it has been shown that after blocking the commercials, news sites such as New York Times are twice as fast, according to Reuters.
Locking up advertisements also helps users maintain the use of data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several calls blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop advertising locking tool, launched its own iOS web browser that limits advertisements; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People who use software programs to block advertisements are facing a few constraints.
The advertisements are still displayed in applications (from here Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are attempting to prevent their visitors from using such a blockage feature.
However, their use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development poses great challenges to the online media, which, in most cases, is offered to consumers free of charge and has been financially supported for many years by advertising.
One report says that blocking advertisements could cost online editors nearly 22 billion in revenues generated from commercials only this year.
To enable closing of ads in iOS 9, users must download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama welcomed King Felipe VI of Spain to the White House on Tuesday, where the two discussed various subjects, but which were probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the king addressed the subject of the struggle against the Islamic State and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - already confronted by hundreds of thousands of people who left their country of origin to go west.
“Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous journeys, and the problem of human trafficking,” Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened in recent months.
Obama also emphasized the importance of cooperation, especially in the context in which the Spanish territory of Catalonia will vote in the elections that will take place this month.
"With regard to foreign policy, we have committed ourselves firmly to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The superintendent also told King Felipe that he would like to visit his country before the end of his term in 2017.
"We welcome you with open arms," Felipe answered.
The first lady, Michelle Obama, gave the Queen a tour of the White House and had a chat at tea.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States from the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to visit South Florida.
Alfre Woodard joined the Luke Cage series team
Famous actress Alfre Woodard joined the future distribution of the Netflix Luke Cage series at Marvel. She will be the antagonist of Mike Colter, who plays the role of the superhero that gives the title to the series.
Woodard will play the role of Mariah Dillard - “a local politician in Harlem and cousin of character Cornell “Cottonmouth” Stokes recently announced, played by Mahershala Ali - who intends to bring an era of change on the streets he has grown,” says a press release.
Her personal life and career are given over her head by the newest hero of Harlem, Luke Cage, but also by the infamous actions of her cousin, Cottonmouth.
“Alfre has an incredible, unique and intimidating presence on screen, which makes it perfect for the leading role of the Harlem community,” says Jeph Loeb, executive producer and president Marvel Television.
We are delighted that such a famous and talented actress, like Alfre, has agreed to join us in this adventure.
The series will have the premiere in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Coker will write the first two episodes and work as a showman and executive producer.
Woodard, 62 years old, is known for TV series Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, L.A. Law, Desperate Weddings and Law firm, but also for films The Devil's Counsel, mysterious Obsession, The Family That Preys, 12 years of slavery and Annabelle.
Luke Cage is one of four Marvel series from the Netflix franchise.
Also soon will be broadcast Jessica Jones and Iron Fist, but also the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" have the world premiere on the same day
Fox foresees many positive results before the first two of his most expected series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season of Queens and the second season of the Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal premiere.
As Variety relates, the strategy is a trend applied for high-profile series, as global social network traffic ensures success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to value the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series that are spoken very much, such as Empire and Screen Queens," said the president of Fox International, Hernan Lopez, according to Deadline.
"We're just waiting to broadcast these very interesting series for fans from all over the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve every day bring the success of a series to the premiere and throughout his life cycle.
The next season in the Empire, in which they will play famous celebrities such as Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, has the premiere in September.
The new Scream Queens series, where Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande will play, will be broadcast the next day in September.
Members of the British Royal Family will take part in the World premiere of the film "Spectre"
Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge will take part in the next month in London at the world premiere of the most recent film by James Bond, "Spectre".
The Kensington Palace announced the news on Twitter on Wednesday, appointing the premier for Royal Film Performance for Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release by the producers, "Spectre" is the third Bond film chosen as RFP from 1946.
In the past, the royal premieres have been selected and "Don't die today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on 26 October at the Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charity, after which the employees of the British film and television industry will benefit.
In addition, actors from the film distribution will be involved, including lead actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and producer Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go to the red carpet with members of the royal family.
"Spectre" will be broadcast in US cinemas in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
Model Christie Brinkley and musician John Mellencamp were seen eating dinner Monday, sparking the rumor that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photos surprised Brinkley cheerful and smiling.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing blues, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in blouses, slippers and boots.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend who split up and with whom she constantly settles, actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the star of Message for you at the NBC Today show, saying it was “an angel who was sent to me and I am very happy.”
He added that “no one ends until it ends.”
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Brinkley Cook Sailor, posted for Seventeen magazine, riding on her mother's tracks.
Arctic mosquito wheels are large enough to take down a karib
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable due to the hottest climate, but global warming has proved to be beneficial to others.
One of these beneficial species is the Arctic mosquito.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, the warmer temperatures in the Arctic region allowed the mosquitoes here to appear early and grow larger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic populations.
Their analysis anticipates a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult mosquitoes under a 2 degrees Celsius increase in temperature.
Peasants are small, but they are important members of the Arctic and ecosystem chain.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists better anticipate how a growing population of villages could affect the karuts they feed with, the birds and insects that feed with them and the plants they pollen.
To build its demonstration, the scientists at Dartmouth combined their results from the field with laboratory experiments that investigated how temperature influences insect development and the predisposition to be hunted by predators.
Although increasing temperature makes higher mosquitoes more vulnerable to coleopters, it also gives them a early start in spring and makes the development of their larvae faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
More mosquitoes mean a larger population, which can develop but only to the extent that it can be supported by insect food.
The ability of the mosquitoes to transform their improved survival rate into an improved breeding rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies note that the administration of antidepressants in pregnant women has no effect on the neural or behavioral development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) present an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have stated that depression is an even greater risk for women and their children, which is why they should be treated.
“These studies add an increasing set of evidence on the safety of the administration of antidepressants during pregnancy,” said John Thorp, deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, so far the evidence seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are higher than those of antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the motor development of children treated with SSRI, analyzing data of 51 404 children from the Norwegian Cohort Study of Mother and Child, investigating the effects of using SSRI for the development of motor skill at the age of 3.
Researchers found that 381 mothers had been using SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of these had been treated with prolonged medication.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in engine development, researchers wrote in the study that the association “was not so significant as to give the delay a clinical significance”.
A group of researchers from the Australian Adelaide University conducted a data review for 49 000 women from the Danish National Birth Cohort to discover the effects of SSRI administration on children's behaviour up to the age of 7.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
In 210 children whose mothers had been treated with SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared to 231 children who were more prone to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more likely to bleed after birth if they are treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30,198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers have reported.
Researchers said that, although the study linked the administration of SSRI with increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from the medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information that researchers had about women's specific medical conditions - that could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
“It is possible for women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced pregnancy stage to be those with the most severe stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal bleeding, not antidepressants,” says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study, we do not recommend that women stop treatment against depression during pregnancy, but be closely monitored to reduce the risk of a potential bleeding.
Matthew is accused of murder in the case of murder of students from Virginia Technical University
The man charged with the murder of Hannah Graham student at Virginia University was accused of qualified murder in the case of a student at the University of Virginia missing in 2009, they announced the authorities on Tuesday.
The great jury in Albemarle, Virginia, charged Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. on Friday, 33, in Charlottesville, for the murder of Morgan Harrington, the officials say.
Matthew is also accused of kidnapping with intent to rape.
Each head of charge receives the maximum prison sentence on life.
Harrington, 20 years old, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the accusation has brought them ease.
"For six years we've been working decidedly and recklessly for this," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm thrilled to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for your act.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to be seated.
Police say there is a medical-legal link between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 sexual abuse of Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty for him and awaits the sentence in this case.
He's staying in jail in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew charged with qualified murder in the death of a student from Virginia University
Harrington went to the U-Va on October 17, 2009, together with his friends, to a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington came out of John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't go back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a taxi around 20:30 in front of the sand.
Harrington was dressed in a black shirt with the Panthera band.
After her disappearance, Harrington's bag and mobile phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends began an extensive search of Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. The men of Metallica wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt that he wore was found near a string of Charlottesville apartments.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated lan, in a farm south-west of Charlottesville.
During the time of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew had worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear if that period overlapped with the date Harrington disappeared.
Police say that a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the event of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said that these cases are related to DNA evidence.
The investigators did not make the details of the new evidence that led him to put Matthew on charge for Harrington's murder at the moment.
Defense attorney Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham's case, refused to make statements.
The announcement of the accusation comes two days after the one-year completion of Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both of them were young students who disappeared when they went out to the city in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18-year-old in Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a central mall near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the first days after Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at the meetings and views organized for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says he endured for her daughter speculations and media critics that must be silenced by the new charges heads against Matthew.
"There have been talks all this time about "Why wear a short skirt?" and "Do you look for it with the candle?" but this kind of question and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we have to deal with a predator on the trail of hunting," said Harrington.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault on a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 years old at the time of the attack, told the jury that, one night in September, while she was coming home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
He took her to a green zone, beat her up and held her throat, then attacked her.
"I thought the end came to me, that I should scream unstoppable," the woman confessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew suddenly ran away, said the woman.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew might have been scared by the lights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was sentenced years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will receive the sentence in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said he'd most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least, today we've taken another step," says Dan Harrington.
Did Jon Snow die or not?
Kit Harington Actor gives us a clue
Actor Kit Harington gave an important clue about the character's fate or the Game of Thrones series, Jon Snow, which was killed at the end of the fourth season.
In an interview with Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knew the duration of the contract or with the HBO position, according to Digital Spy.
Asked how many seasons he's gonna show up, he said he can't talk about this.
Let's just say that the show will be part of my life for some time, I'll probably be over 30 years when it's over.
But one thing is certain.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then it will be the time when I'm buried in long film projects," said the actor.
The show's back on the little screens in the spring of next year.
Fans Games of Thrones triggered a hysteria after the end of the fourth season, when the character Jon Snow was stabbed and launched several theories, according to which he will somehow be restored to life.

Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Medium" programmes, both interrupted at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a statement by the representative of Romania of the European Commission following this decision, about EUR 120 million will be transferred to the Roman authorities in the following period.
I am happy to announce the release of these payments and appreciate the efforts of the Roman authorities to improve the management and control systems under the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weak points and solving problems.
"I hope that the masses will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," said European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Corina Crete.
"The extreme statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," he reacted to the Hungarian diplomat's chief.
Peter Szijjarto asked European Socialists to stop "the campaign of lies" at Hungary.
Referring to the statements made by Harlem Desir, the French Secretary of State for European Affairs, concerning the guard built by Hungary, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European immigration strategy", insisting that national borders must be protected.
Romania wants to hit the rugby World Cup

"We want two wins, with the Canadian and Italian teams," said Mihai Macovei, captain of Romania.

Refugee crisis: No solution at all
President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, announced that Thursday he will take a decision on whether to convene a European Union Summit on Migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann asked on Tuesday to organize a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis.
In a press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot handle the refugee crisis alone.
The head of the German executive expressed support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls against the massive influx of asylum seekers, noting that the measure is intended to facilitate the registration of refugees.
On the other hand, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redistribute refugees between Member States on the basis of mandatory quotas - has decided to organise an extraordinary EU summit.
EU Ministers of Internal Affairs, meeting in Brussels on Monday evening, failed to adopt the new proposal for an urgent redistribution of 120,000 refugees between Member States of the European Union, submitted on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the refugee emergency relocation mechanism, foresees the rapid redistribution of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, new controversial cartoons
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo is causing further controversy, following the publication of cartoons that mock the response of the predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from the predominantly Muslim countries affected by war.
In the most recent issue of the publication, it has attracted attention again, as well as critics on social networks, writes Reuters.
One of the drawings inflames an overwhelming image of Aylan Kurdi, the innocent Syrian boy, whose body arrived on one of the beaches in Turkey, after an attempt to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing shows a child in short and shirt pants, with the face down on the sea shore, next to an advertising panel offering two children's menus at one's price.
"So close to succeeding," is the message behind the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack from the Paris office in January, is accompanied by the message "The proof that Europe is Christian".
The design presents a character like Jesus, who walks on the water, while a smaller character wears short short pants with his feet up in the water, the first saying "Crestinis go on the water", takes the second "Muslims drown."
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after an attack by Islamist militants in January, following repeated threats following the jeering of the prophet Muhammad.
A trend of supermarkets present in Romania, dramatic fined in Russia
The French Auchan supermarket chain has been fined by over $370,000 by Russian officials, being charged with food security breach.
Anna Popova, head of Russian consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor, said the fines total over 25 million rubles, that is 372,000 dollars, reports the agency Associated Press, quoted by US News.
The reasons why these fines were granted were not stated, and Auchan made no comment.
The French chain of supermarkets is also the target of the accusations of the Russian agricultural agency, which claims that some meat products have been found to be infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come in a period of tension between France and Russia, on the subject of extending the sanctions of the European Union and the decision of France to cancel an agreement on the supply of the Mistral Russian ships.
The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the news that Hungary could raise a metal fence to our country's border.
MAE shows that it has been briefed in connection with this decision and that it is not a politically correct gesture.
MAE shows, in a statement submitted to Journal.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before being announced publicly.
On the other hand, the EMA informed in due course of the urgency of the relevant decision-making factors in Romania in connection with this situation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a fence between two EU Member States and being strategic partners is not a politically correct gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian Party, more appears in the communication.
Hungary makes plans to build a metal fence on a segment of the border with Romania, in the context of the immigrant crisis, stated Tuesday Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, quoted by Mediafax.
"The mass is necessary for the smugglers of people who pass through Serbia to change their routes, and there is a chance of heading towards Romania," the Hungarian diplomat's chief explained.
"The guard would begin at the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the pressure of migration moved to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants crossing the Sarb territory on their way to the European Union were trying to shake the fence built by the Hungarian authorities through the eastern end of it, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have found that they can bypass the fence through the area of Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Government of Hungary has allocated 22.2 billion furnaces (71.8 million euros) to build a controversial metal fence at the border with Serbia, a distance of 175 kilometers, and for the special centres needed to hunt immigrants.
The guard's initiative is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
There's no need, he'll stay there.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor's inflated body will not be deposited in the Senate of Romania, despite his desire to do so expressed by the politician's widow.
According to a release of Journal.com, the Senate's Permanent Office discussed, on Tuesday, a request from Doine Vadim Tudor, concerning the approval of the uninflated submission of the former Senator Cornelius Vadim Tudor in the Senate headquarters.
"From receiving this letter until the moment of the analysis, in the Permanent Bureau, the uninflated body has already been deposited at a place of worship and will remain there, the Permanent Bureau appreciates that it no longer needs to be moved from there to the Senate of Romania," the Senate transmits.
PNL Senator Teodor Atanasiu argued that this request "is not in agreement with the geographical position of Romania somewhere in Europe".
It also transmits Agerpres, senators have maintained a moment of recall in memory of former PRM leader, at the proposal of UNPR Senator Serban Mihailescu.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died on Monday night around 6:30.

The European Parliament will be buried on Thursday, from 12:00 to the Ghencea cemetery, and will have military honours.
Do refugees come to Romania?
Mayors of the locality of the border, questions about accommodation
Mayors in Arad County border areas are questioned by Police and Border Police, these days, about accommodation places for any refugees who could reach Romania, but also for Jandarmi, where they will be mobilized to the border.
The building of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were conducted with farmers in the area, who were asked to report about the presence of any strangers near the border.
We had discussions with border police, national police and local police, and farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I asked the farmers, who have works in this period on arable land, to be careful and to report any movement," the building said.
Immigrants' crisis hits in Hungary: Armoured and Tuns on the border
This, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said the police asked for information on the accommodation available in the event of confrontation with a wave of refugees.
We've been asked how many people we can hunt.
We in the commune have no refugee space.
We believe that such special centres should not even stand at the border, because they are harder to control here, the migrants being tempted to flee, because they are not interested to remain in Romania.
It would be better if such centres were established in more remote areas of the border," the mayor of Iratosu, Papp Atila Iosif, said.
On the other hand, Mayor Dorobanti, Vincentiu Almasi, said that he was asked so many places for refugees as well as for the intervention forces, in case they were mobilized in the area.
The police are interested if we can hunt and jandarms.
We could find places on the Cultural Way, but for refugees we have no possibility of accommodation.
"I've been questioned about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," Vincenti Almasi said.
He added that at the local police station, "beginning on Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it has established itself permanently."
"There's always a police officer at the station, and the locals know that they have to inform if they notice any strangers in the area," said the building.
The representatives of the Pulu Primarie said they could have as many as one hundred people in the Cultural Way, the information being provided to the police at their request.
The mayor of the city of Curtici, Nicolae Anonitee, also said that there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of the local public finance, but there are needed facilities here.
Also, a former border police barracks could be put in place to host refugees.
The representatives of the Arad County Police Press Office did not provide an opinion on the question of mayors in this period, only confirming that "in the border towns of Arad county, patrol activities have been intensified".
Army Club Commander announces radical measures against Becali Star
Army Sport Club Commander, Colonel George Boroi, announces a series of radical measures that will be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Although the two parties have negotiated a settlement, Boroi claims that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historical palm tree of the "ros-blues".
The team that won the Cup of Champions is on the break for now.
"It's not a historic break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have the team, but things can change next year," Boroi said at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the process of requesting damage from Becali's team will continue.
The period at which we refer to by the ICCJ decision is very clear.
We need to recover the damage from FC Stara, the team that used the Stara brand without the consent of the owner - i.e. CSA Stara.
It appears very clearly and the continuity of the section, which was in fact permanent to the Army Club.
"So the state of Bucharest football team, in one form or another, but in a legal form, must exist as a continuation of the perfumes that it has so far in the palm trees," says George Boroi.
The Star of Becali and the Army Club were in the open war since the end of last year, when the supreme instant decided that the military are the ones who hold the Star.

"Dorel" mounted the traffic lights backwards
In Suceava, the workers mounted a traffic light up below, so instead of being aware that they've waited for 4 seconds, passersby get the "h" message, which I don't know how to decipher.
Don't shower them, anyhow, everyone goes to the red, informs the truth.
Everyone goes through the way they cut his head off.
Two boys were to be taken up by a car because they passed through the red.
"Politics at the Routea should be here, to help, until the world gets used to it," said a woman for the cited source.
The traffic light was recently mounted in front of the Sea Piece in the center of Suceve, but the passersby do not seem to care more about it, as much as the information received seems to be unintelligent.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" was doing his job properly and someone was found responsible enough to give his ok for the completion of the work, then it would never have come to this absurd situation.
The head of the Strazi Administration and Systematization Route of the Suceava Mayor recognized it was the face when the traffic lights started to work, but he didn't realize that something was wrong.
We used it, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"Even I was the girl when they were put into operation," said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be corrected in the shortest time.
Thank God it can be remedied, because there are situations in which "Dorel" has made irreparable damage.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Ruse gas pipeline, "Dorel" missed the drilling mill that dug the tunnel under the Danube, it is not known where, probably under the ground, buried, as it was not found, after even supported the Minister of the Economy, Mihai Tutose.
Police put the water cannons on immigrants
On the main border of Hungary with Serbia, Hungarian granites used, on Wednesday, cannons with water and tear gas against immigrants.
Although Hungary closed the border with a sarma fence and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, on the sarbo-ungara border continued to gather refugees, The Guardian writes.
The water cannons were put into operation when the immigrants managed to patrol through the sarma fence, which was crossed to the Roszke border.
Hungarian police support that cannon action was a crowd control measure, throwing water bottles.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some tearful people, after the use of tear gas.
At the same time, the publication of Elena Enikos writes that two German companies refused to deliver the rhyme of Hungary.
Tara has already raised the fence to the border with Serbia and Tuesday has announced her intention to raise one and to the border with Romania, a strongly criticised initiative in Bucharest.
German companies claim that the salty salt is very dangerous and causes cuts that can be infected.
It is used to secure prisoners or military installations, but should not be used against people who seek shelter, support companies.
In parallel to the challenges of the Hungarian border, Croatia has mobilized to make it available to the immigrants on the bus to transport those on the border to Serbia.
Croatian Interior Ministry confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, including 73 children, further showed the Ministry.
Tsipras, about Greece's drama - why it agrees with the third EU agreement
The declared aim of the former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from even more austerity and to fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels.
Finally, the leader of Syriza made part of a third loan agreement in Greece, which also involves more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which provides an interview with this country.
Now, however, Tsipras calls on the Greeks to re-entrust the prime minister in the course of elections that he claims to be political in his position.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the dismemberment of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring debt for Greece remains open," the former prime minister said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have ended in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the view that the financing part of the agreement represents a great success for the Greek government, showing that all the financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says that Greece "certainly needs reforms", specifying that it must begin with the reform of the state.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections in September after 7 stormy months at the head of the Athens Executive, when a third rescue loan was approved for Greece.

Actress from Star Trek, in prison because she got naked in front of some kids
Actress Jennifer Lien, known from Star Trek, where he played for three seasons, instructing Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that took her to prison, where she was on September 3rd -- the bail being set at $2,500 -- took place in front of her home in Tennessee.
The Vedeta started arguing with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of his crying children, informs Mirror.

When the police came, Jennifer refused to get dressed.
Moreover, it threatened to kill the police and was carried with force to the car.
It's not the first time she's been acting in the age of 41 she's having trouble with the police; in April she was also arrested, then doing her guilt including assault.

They're taken in sight with the western machine gun.
Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar of Assad has given a rare interview to the Russian press, in which he speaks about refugees and accuses the West as supporting terrorists and as "he's in sight" to immigrants.
"The West cries for them and the West sustains the terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when he said that this is a panic revolution," Assad said, in an interview with Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus claims that his Western counterparts say about the situation in Syria that it is terrorism like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian State or Syrian regime or Syrian President".
As long as this propaganda takes place, there will be more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept them or hugged them as refugees, it's about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, stop supporting terrorists.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the whole issue of refugees," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued his accusations to Western States and with regard to the treatment they show to refugees.
It's like the West now cries for refugees with one eye and takes them in sight with the second-eyed machine gun, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, primarily because of terrorists and crimes and second-hand because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and destruction of the infrastructure, you won't have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to win their existence somewhere in this world," Bashar of Assad says.
"If I were asking any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding as the political forces either inside or outside the government, "we should unite around what the Syrian people want."
The president of Syria is of the view that his country's dialogue should continue "to reach consensus", which cannot be implemented "if we violate terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to ask all forces to unite against terrorism, because it is how we can achieve the political goals that we, as Syrians, want through dialogue and political action," Bashar of Assad said.
He also spoke of one of his country's allies, Russian president Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, he was transformed from the friend of the West into his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, yet again accusing the West of falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the hit in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into a enemy and was characterized as a Tar.
He is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses Russia's opposition and has gained power through non-democratic means, despite the fact that he was elected to democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, I'm not democratic anymore.
"This is Western propaganda," the leader of Damascus pointed out.
Not least, it included Russia on the list of friends - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, alongside Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
On the other hand, Bashar of Assad criticized Turkey, another neighboring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, about which he said "I can't even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, Syria's president accuses the "international coalition", led by the United States, who fights against terrorism: "In fact, since this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State has begun to expand."
In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the Western countries that provide cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight against terrorism.
You can't be against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will interfere - then we have no object in cooperating with all these countries, given that it is a real and not false coalition, that fights terrorism," said the leader at Damascus.
Autumn?
Not at all.

The map of the countries with the biggest cheaps and how Romania stands
The collapse of the oil quota has caused major losses in the last year of workers in the extraction of the title, of the shareholders of the energy companies and of the countries that are heavily dependent on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: gasoline has cost itself enormously.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, from October 2014 to July 2015, in almost all 76 countries taken into account, the price of fuel has fallen.
The most important price reduction in the pump is observed in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine has been cheap with 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs with less than one dollar.
The opposite pole was Saudi Arabia, where the price is fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the conditions for refining, the changes as regards taxation, but also the fluctuations of the currency course.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price in each state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
Bloomberg data shows that, in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (approx. 3.8 liters) was $5.49.
Thus, we ranked the 27th place on the edge of the countries with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The last quarter of 2014, the gas was also cheap for the Romans.
Then, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a 10.6% discount.
However, the countries around me are even better.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of gasoline costs $4.92 and in Hungary $5.20.
The Gentiles are setting up the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised, Tuesday night, that the federal government will provide additional support to the 16 Länders of the federation in the receipt and distribution of tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a nearly 4 hours meeting with prime ministers in the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to face the large number of refugees," notes the DPA agency.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 seats for initial arrivals as well as distribution centres.
"These pivot points are needed," she stressed.
The whole country must provide a massive impulse to face the crisis, Merkel added.
The Prime Ministers asked for more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the ruling coalition at the federal level more than a week ago.
Prime Minister Turingie Bodo Ramelow of the Stanga Party requested a "little double, and for commitments, be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
On the other hand, the premier of the Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into the German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also called for red tape in the handling of refugees and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed processing in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Prime Minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
Until now, Bavaria bears the greatest burden, with the most migrants arriving after passing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a strong actor on the federal scene as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual open door policy early in the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu makes scandal after humiliating defeat with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nerve car at the end of the match with Real Madrid, which Sahtir Donetk lost by 0-4.
The Roman coach showed himself totally disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost intrusion was disfavored.
Before the game I said one thing, I want to be respected.
Unfortunately, in the games with important teams in Europe we are always disadvantaged by arbitration.
There's two totally different ways.
New we are given a yellow card immediately, while the top teams are not.
Besides, the first penalty was in no way!
The ball hit Darijo's back, without touching his hand.
A game of such a level should not have been influenced by arbitration.
"Regret that arbitration broke the game," said Mircea Lucescu at the press conference.
"Ma'am, but what smells so ugly here"?
They were pieces of the cut husband.
A murder of a common sadism terrified the inhabitants of Târgu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hours of the day, the markets in Târgu Frumos could see terrifying scenes near the main market entry.
Along with the three graves, the criminals "gathered" in pieces what seemed to be a man's body.
It was locked, but it was missing his head, internal organs and genitals.
In the end, it would prove that it was the body of a former officer, who had been handed over by his wife, a geography teacher.
The "Jași's day" has been talking to the indeletes even with the taximeter who helped the killer, without knowing, at the book of the bags with the dead body.
Its stories make your hair look skinny.
The one who alerted the police yesterday about the fact that a woman whose three bags were horrifying, after pieces of the body had been found in the market, was a taxi driver in the Târgu Frumos.
As in American films, the man helped himself to transport bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but without knowing it, the killer being the client for a race.
The taxi driver reported, exclusively for "Iaș's Day", shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide the evidence.
He carried with his hands the bags in which the body pieces of the husband of the geography teacher were lying.
She had come to Târgu Beautiful to hide the evidence of the murder, as far away from her home as Roman.
Maybe she has mine.
I didn't have how you know.
Nea Mihai, as he is known to his friends who practice taximetry in Târgu Beautiful, has become famous overnight in the little town he lives in.
He saw American films throughout his life, but never thought he'd ever get himself to be the one who will lay at the bottom of discovering a sadistic crime, and will see with his eyes pieces of bodies.
It tells that, on Monday to Tuesday night, it usually waits for the arrival of buses that regularly transit the town.
It is close to the intersection of roads to Roman and to Pascans.
The taximetrist reports that the killer woman observed in the rear view mirror, near the bag with the pieces of body supported by the indicator showing nearby locations.
She came in the night with the Massaro race from 1.30.
The bus left it ten meters away from the passage of the pedestrians from the Pascans, right at the terminal where it displays the mileage.
The bags were garnished by the sign with the indicator.
After the bus left, I gave the marcher ten meters, up to it.
I opened the trunk and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Ma'am, what do you smell so ugly here?"
I saw she was an old woman, and I told her to help her.
I thought she was bringing meat to the market, getting rid of it, maybe she has mine, I didn't have any way to know.
I thought he might want to suck someone with that ugly smelly meat.
She was trying to pick up a bag alone, and I repeated to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was bound.
"He specified me to take her to the big market gate when I took her from the bus," he started telling Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He added that the woman didn't say anything at all, and therefore he wasn't interested in asking her anything anymore.
To the point, I didn't talk about anything, because I was nervous that he put my thief in the car.
And when he took the bags out of the car, I noticed that it smells even worse.
She took the bags out of the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I put two meters in the back to get back, and I realized I can't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and moved the car over and over here, to disappear the smell.
I didn't notice at the bus if someone was helped to drop the bag, because we had lights in the back and we didn't see well in the mirror.
"There were two plastic bags and one of rafia," the man completed.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, she says she's starting to touch her curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something wasn't right.
After he gave his bags down, I went to the hospital, to the city hall, and when I got back, I looked special to see what the woman was doing with the luggage.
She had been in the middle of the post-war baggage, where are the graves inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a little agitation because a microbus of Italy and a bus arrived.
I saw the woman go to their drivers to get in, disappear, but the drivers probably didn't want to take it, because they have international races, and they don't take passengers on occasion.
The woman was very nervous, walking back and forth.
At some point, the woman entered Peco and, curiously, I asked a employee outside what she did inside.
The employee answered that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where she was patrolling the police because I saw her some time ago.
I looked for them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and told them it was something suspicious.
"Then I went somewhere else, a race to Belcești," Mihai completed.
He also told us that the woman had become agitated after she left the luggage in the dumpsters.
At me, suspicion left from that missing baggage, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and they showed me, telling her that I paid attention to her having a suspicious luggage.
Then the woman went to the dumplings and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to the place where he hid his bags around 3:00 when I gave statements to the police and prosecutors on the spot," he finished his taxi driver's report.
The prosecutors in Neamț, who investigate the case, say that 64-year-old teacher Ana Zaharia was surprised by the cameras of a Roman gas station at 0.55, going up with the three bags in the bus.
She arrived at the Beautiful Târgu at 1.30.
According to investigators, she would have killed her husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, then locked him in the house.
The man was called Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday night, the woman put the body pieces in two plastic bags, which she carried to the bus, and hid them.
Last night, he carried another one, then decided in which direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iași.
Last night, the prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid the husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But the head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, in a shed in the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, the prosecutors didn't find out from the woman who was the reason why she killed her husband with so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be experienced psychically, and the body will be examined by the legal doctors, to officially determine the cause of death and possible other relevant details.
The municipality took over the national roads of the municipality, after years ago they had been taken by the Government, in order to be asphalt with money from the national budget, in the 2004 election campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and a decision by the Government is needed to be applied.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a de facto condition for the State to grant the opinion for the Plan Ur banistics General (PUG).
The city has taken over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any event, a legislative amendment adopted in July 2015 obliges the municipality to take over the national roads that pass through the municipality.
No opinion can be issued from the National Roads if the law is not complied with, so it was necessary to approve this.
The national roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, the government's decision will have to be issued as a consequence of this decision of the Local Council," said the interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The national roads that surround the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The National Route 28 hits Iașul on the arteries: the road Păcurari, the road Munteni (to be made), the Moara de Foc, the Strapongione Silvestru, the street Silvestru, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. the spring, the road Chisinau, the road Túțora until the exit of the municipality to Tomești - Albița.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the road Bucium, bd. Socola (up to traffic light), road Bucium (up to base 3), the Chisinau Way, Mr Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and the exit to Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
In the next description of the files in the "folder" of Mircea Elias's political sympathies of youth, which, as far as condensate, would have presented the dimension of a daily article and should be broadcast in the series, it deserves, I believe, evoked the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most vehemently cape of accusation used by the detractors of the great Romanian scholar.
A less humorous description would be, I hope, useful in the real debate that the recent "antilegiate" law would be appropriate to spark it in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analyzing critical versions of the different versions of Elias in the Legion by means of the "Axa" Cuib and Radu Gyr, Florin Kurcanu brings to the fore the volume Mircea Eliade.
The prisoner of history (București, 2003), another hypothesis, which interested us in the highest degree in understanding the resumption of the epistollary contacts between Radu Gyr and Elias in 1968, after playing Ceaușescu "Scene of the Balcony" of August that year.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the security investigation, in 1941, documents stored today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) and a tracking note from 1938, Florin Tuurcanu said that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in the so-called "legionary family" called the Luminita, a group of "cuiburi" by intellectuals, especially writers, led by poet Radu Gyr".
As with regard to the light nest there is no verifiable data, those in exile considering the existence of this debatable "legislation family", which must be discussed is, after all, the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving to a surprising part of the SRI's kindness to make available these secret dossiers to Mr. Turcanu, it is more than clear that, at that time, the goal of the pursuit of Security was the "command" Radu Gyr, mentioning Eliade, in accordance with the note of 21 March 1938, in the context where Armand Cálinescu, the Minister of Interior had taken the free hand to take all necessary measures to ensure that King Carol could impose his royal dictatorship, suspending his parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of legionaries who were beginning to enjoy an unexpected popularity (the All Party for the Third Country had come out in the 1937 elections).
Eliade's arrest was made following this note, quoted by Hurricane: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, enrolled in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a thin bureaucratic cover for the repression of 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes were made at the reposition for the vast majority of legionnaires or supporters active in the public space that were to be arrested, but which were to be linked by an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's holograph statement mentioned above, given in the arrest, in February 1941, after the violation of the legislate rebellion, only confirms retrospectively on the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police, authoritarian regime.
It would have been interesting if Hurricane had provided more details on the content of the cited dossier.
Was it Eliade's or Radu Gyr's?
Because it has to be a file built on security documents, but then processed by security to be used either against the other or against the other.
It is here a misconception, as well as in the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows the composition of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it is a pre-emptive stage, of the test, in which the person concerned behaves as an active sympathizer, who was in the trial period of three years before becoming "camemarad" with acts in accordance.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as intellectual clubs or scenes, seats, groups of discussion with peasants, young or pregnant students' organisations around a nest, were his "family", were not his own nest, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances completely escapes the unanticipated reader by making the status of Eliade's "member" (which can be plausible) to be understood and used literally to designate the political regiment in the nest.
Of course, the invocation of such subtilities of interpretation cannot conceal the public activity of the Guard's support or clear sympathy for the Captain who cheered Eliade during 1935-1940, whether in Nae Ionescu's wake or not.
Public support for a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean, and the political regime itself stated as much more than, normally, intellectuals of this size retains a type of superiority to the face of the activists as such and does not go into politics than when they are given direct high privileges.
As much as I could think about Elijah's kind of thinking at that time, when he was "the young generation's leader", it's hard for me to believe he would have accepted the hierarchical rigours of a legionary nest.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
In order not to mention, except in the passage, the fact that in any legionary "folder" it receives is public anti-semitic activity as well as violence, both worthy to be stigmatized, but non-existent in the case of Elias, until further evidence.
With regard to Eliade-Gyr's correspondence from 1968 to 1969, Mircea Hangoca, a defending enthusiast of Eliade, tries to sanction Florin's claims from the Kurcanu (based on still some archival documents, even if they had deserved to be dried up and contextualized more seriously) with a questionable argument.
Mircea Hangoca notes, in the Noi glosse volume on Mircea Eliade (București, 2006), that "not a line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains any hint at this fit".
He had no way in 1968, when, somehow out of the communist ocne, Radu Gyr could not have risked any hint in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think she wanted to stress is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, admiration and affection without any doubt about Elijah’s ancestry.
There really is no paleest suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been the head of Elias.
Intelligent, the poet forced to write to the Glass of the Father, devotes himself from the head of the place the embarrassing condition signaling to Eliade (who knew exactly what the mission had that publication that was constantly dealing with the denigration of the right exile), in signature, after "your old friend", to what to expect and is visible easily and happy when it responds affectionately to them after almost three decades of separation from the "viclean time" has driven them away.
There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" with which he had been assigned (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could come back at least quietly to see his mother and friends) and that, skilledly, he fulfills it dry and through short sentences, separated by paragraphs, to suggest their character of foreign body, Radu Gyr shows his interest only for literature.
No talk of ezoteric aludies, refined political complicities or any evocation of young years in another register than the cultural one.
It's hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior on Eliade's legional line, but until the consolidation of this version with less circumstantial evidence than those offered by Florin Kurcanu, we have in these correspondent memory loops that testify to a mutual price of characters that have marked different, but statistical, our culture and that beyond the severe trials of life, we find the tone of civilization and interbellic education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not, forgery for the force of friendship and mutual respect beyond the fate of the authors.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eliade finally gave up the status of refugees by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext of health problems and the catastrophic floods in the country, announced the RSR authorities, through the embassy (which has a sporadic correspondence used to obtain passports for his sister), that he cannot take the course of the invitation to return to the country.
The following was predictable: it is re-indexed, mounts in Israel "Tolladot business", the books sent to family and friends (Fragments of a newspaper, Gallimard, 1973) are censored, never see their mother again.
Of friends in the country only with Noica still has sporadic correspondence although, surprisingly, as a personal archive from Chicago attests, a lot of individuals or Romanian institutions are more able to send messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr never got permission to write to him after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceaușescu regime tried Eliade's second conviction operation (by official invitations, Noica's motions, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr had already gone through forever.
New coach, foreign player
Due to the shortage of native volleyballists, Penicillin Iași tests in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exhausts take part in training tournaments under coach Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year of the A1 Division of the female flight, Penicillina Iasi kept its place in the first stage due to the withdrawal and then to the destruction of the Miroslava Science band, freshly promoted in the first estalon following a dam tournament even disputed in the outgoing municipality.
The news took little on the unprepared leadership of the eessen group, which woke up without the main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, he went second to Bacău Science) and many missing players, some retired such as Cristina Lungu and the free Diana Studneanu, or gone, like Ana-Maria Berdilla (the Blue Blaj Vola champion) and the Maria and Iuliana Fica sisters.
Of course, until the scheduled 10 October championship was resumed, there was also time for the batch to be completed.
First there was found a new coach in Dan Gavril's person, from the male team LPS Piatra Neamț and who has worked little in recent years at Penicilina, he was proud to sign a contract with the group led by the left Vasile.
Then two players from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconița were brought, and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland were tried, closer to transfer being the player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegreanca Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Peniciline lot led by Dan Gavril made a cantonal at the Gura Humorului, after which he participated in a tournament held at Lugoj and equipped with Banat's Cup, where the results made a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, from 23 to 25 September, Penicillina will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship, we're trying to make up a valuable team.
We have a successful and experienced coach, but the player fund in Romania is quite low and that is why we will also call to volleyballist from abroad, especially after the decision was made that the teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the younger generation of sports from Romanian clubs.
"We were hoping to reach the end of the competitive year in 5-6 places, even if it would be very hard," said left Vasile, president ACS Penicilina Iasi.
Thrilled meeting.
Twins gathered after nearly 70 years
Gemen George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, aged 69, were born at the end of World War II in Germany after their Polish mother had barely been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too sick to care for them, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers being thus separated not only from the one who gave them life, but also from the other.
Ten years George and Lucian didn't know one about each other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered the documents that showed that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the '60s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they found no trace to lead them to Lucian.
Only in 2015, thanks to the program , Restoring Family Links" of the Red Cross, the twins met again, and the moment was one more than exciting.
BBC reporters surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iasi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, one silver medals and one bronze medals were won by the kids from abroad at German Open Championship in Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organized by the German Federation of Dans Sportiv and the World Federation of Dans Sportiv.
In Iasi, five teams were trained at the Dance Energy Club and danced with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 Chinese children participated in five different categories (youths 1, juniper 2, juniper 2, juuth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with the medals were the pairs: Răzvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Tarzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Stefana Gologan (bronz medal).
And three other pairs managed to occupy leading places: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Ioana Iosub Cujbe and not least the pair Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionița.
As coach I wanted to confirm the results achieved in March of this year, this confirmation is necessary for both us and sportsmen as regards their future evolution.
The fact that we managed to hear Romania's anthem twice this year at the German Open and go home with four medals makes us very happy and gives us hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to an even higher level.
"All these would be feasible only with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andreea Ramona Manolache, coach of the kids at Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, obtaining a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country for 4 of the 20 participating countries.
Note that of the nine medals, four came to Iasi.
6 methods to get rid of stress in a minute
Too few of us allow us to run a mountain weekend to escape stress.
Some take their time, others their finances, and others their impediments.
But there are solutions to anyone who wants to escape a little stress.
They do not imply any high costs or special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
The day-to-day cares are inevitable, but it depends on how we make them and what attitude we take from them.
Instead of machining you inside and feeling like an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the following relaxation tactics that don't steal more than a minute.
Deep Breathe
Breathing exercises are not intended for soleists or yoga practitioners only.
They work for every man in part, and regulating breathing in a tense moment helps release endorphins in the body, which leads to a relaxation state, informs Livestrong.
Be a child
We know that we're past the age of childhood and we're not allowed to join when we're in a mood.
But that doesn't mean we can't go to a corner of the office office or wherever we know we're alone (even behind the building) and we can't type how much we have the fans.
You can get rid of the nerves and the negative energy accumulated over a day with a few storms.
Imagine a nice place.
We know that the recommendation calls for a replica during a psychotherapy session, but the psychologists often use it.
The imagination of a beautiful place, which inspires us calm and detasation of daily frenzy, can lead to attenuation of the nerve state.
It's really about self-suggestion, which can even change lives, both good and bad.
Everything depends on what we're suggesting.
The best thing is to think about a idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Put your castles in your ears and listen to the music of relaxation.
Attention, it's not about the favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal you might get weighed down in your relaxation.
Listen to even the relaxation tunes, which are lined and do not contain verses, to restore the balance when you're lit up.
Decojiti o orange
Does it sound strange the advice to untie an orange in the nerves?
Well, it's not!
Because it is not the fruit itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occasional, too total).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of orange shell, during decoys, stimulates its brain to produce endorphins, well-being hormone.
Handle an animal
Those who have animals nearby, whether it's about the home, or it's about the one who has decided to go to the place of work, take a few seconds to handle it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal mangling may decrease blood pressure.
Time and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with somewhat rival instruments, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces from the Roman folklore combining violin with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is entitled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, write hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found ourselves, and from that moment we had great pleasure singing together, having a virtually unlimited repertoire."
We thought this was the time when there was a violin with a guitar.
Christi: "From the first meeting we realized that we are very well hearing what we sing and that, from the standpoint of the human component, things work."
Each of us has learned from each other's repertoire, and what is very important is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there's a plague between classical music people and the rest."
I think many people can listen to classical music.
And secondly, we were stealing a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who listen only to classical music to listen and rock, and those who listen only to rock to get to play and classical music.
And I had the surprise to tell us at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to something like that and they'd love it.
Christi: "When we find young people - and find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, it seems formidable to us."
The students in Iasi were more in traffic than at school on the first day after the vacation
Hundreds of rabbits were "captives" yesterday morning in hell traffic in several areas.
The municipality announced that the Mangeron Boulevard is now closing between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roş.
The mayors of the city have not complied with their promises of performing works for the fluidization of traffic as well as the beginning of the school year.
One of the assurances that the municipality has given them, at least twice over the past few weeks, has noticed the re-establishment of the tour in the International Guard area.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be set up, and the last time the work was done last week, yesterday the tour was not done.
The nerves of the drivers were laid to a maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another promise of the municipality was also violated: the move of the customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Technopolis "the late one by the end of August", in the context where this transfer has been discussed since 2012.
Currently, the interim mayor Mihai Chirica says the problem at the International Station is more complicated.
The rotation will be made at the right time, we must take into account the traffic of the trams in the area, must be an opinion and from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tram to stay on the turn, but we'll sort it out," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to him, would be to stop the tram with a traffic light before turning.
Traffic problems were also in the intersection of the Red Podu.
The car tail on the St. Lazarus Street stretched to the SRI headquarters.
"I've waited minutes to be able to get out in the red Podu," said a chessman.
By Podu Roș in September they had to move tramway to CUG, if the rehabilitation project "South functional artery development and rehabilitation" was completed within the initial run-up (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the original.
"I drew European funds for new works, e.g. overtime, on the initial version of the Nicolina passage was narrow," Chirica commented.
The most recent deadline for the reintroduction of road traffic is October.
During the course of yesterday, the islanders reported traffic problems especially in areas such as Păcurari, Centro (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armean Street) or the intersection of Base 3.
The Armenians could return as chief at the CJ.
In the course of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The judges of the Court will decide tomorrow whether the suspended president of the Judicial Council will be kept in judicial control and prohibitions.
The Judges of the Iasi Court resolved a new term yesterday in the record "Album", in which the defendant is also the suspended president of the Iasi County Council.
At the end of yesterday's meeting, the judges decided to pronounce themselves in the course of tomorrow's day on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against the Armenians.
The latter wishes to reside or withdraw this measure, which keeps it away from the head seat of the CJ for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it will be maintained by the higher court, Cristian Adomnţia will be able to resume its role as President of the CJ.
The Armenians were sued by the National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA), being accused of favoring the perpetrator and forgery intellectual after, I say, pro-Courts, would try to mask an audit control after which a number of irregularities were found regarding the reception of a signed public contract between CJ and the company Laser Co.
The Armenians would have tried to hide that the institution that led would not have received more material to promote Iasi county, although these materials were shown to be received by CJ.
Along with him were the courts and three directors of the CJ, but also the manager of the Laser Co.
Another 3,500 are expected to vote until September 25th.
The municipality is prepared to distribute other questions, if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The Americans have only ten days to express their opinion on the replanting of the tea on the Great Stephen's pedestrian.
According to municipal officials, some 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed at the neighbourhood centres and three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Esplanada Alexandru the Good and the City Hall) have been completed so far.
A record number of hesitates was presented Sunday in front of the city hall.
According to the representatives of the civic group "Iașul loves teas", 530 laymen voted in 140 minutes, and almost four votes cast each minute.
Instead, throughout the course of the month, the same place came about 440 ees.
Volunteers of the group say that many of them are out advertising and the people are feeling inefficient of public consultation.
Therefore, they made a call yesterday to internet users to print an information poster made available to the group and to paste it in the block stairs.
Volunteers have also shown that the last formulas have been completed by eesenas on Sunday at the additional point in the Copou park.
We'll offer formulation from the neighborhood centers, where it's not very complete.
"Perhaps additions will be made when all 12,000 formulations will be completed," said the municipality's spokesman, Sebastian Buraga yesterday.
"Scruti nell teils" will end on September 25, and if the majority vote of the exits is in favour of replanting the trees then the Prime Minister will plant your silver in this fall.
The banks may express their opinion at the district centres of Dacia, Frumosa, Tâtarași, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as at the above mentioned additional points.
The mayors decided to cut the teas from Stephen the Great at the beginning of 2013, which brought a fine of 60,000 lei of the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without a consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous emergence of the civic group "Iash loves tea", an online community of about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for the replanting of tea was signed by over 9100 supporters until yesterday evening.
RECORD of students enrolled in USAMV Iasi!
I'm 920 in year I
The university has this year 920 students in the year I.
Representatives of the University of Science Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" indicated that this year the most candidates ever admitted, from the history of the higher education institution, since the establishment.
We are very pleased with the results this year from admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates in university history, almost 920 students in year I. We never exceeded such a number.
"We've also had higher average candidates, we've taken over budget posts at license and master," said Professor Ioan Tenu, the director responsible for teaching.
It further noted that the university has also registered a considerable number of students at the tax, occupying 20% of the places in question, a significantly higher number than in other years.
Although the results have also been published in the Romanian language study lines, the continued admission to the English language study program at the Veterinary Medical School, which took out 50 seats at the competition, where the fee is 5,000 euros, and is now expected to be answered by the ministry regarding the confirmation of student files and study visas required.
At the fall session, a total of 120 files were deposited on the 14 budgeted places and 209 were removed to the competitions in the "tax" system in the licensing studies.
Most of the files were filed at the Faculty of Agriculture, 75, at Horticulture, 23 and at Zoothehnie, 22.
At the master's session, 18 files were filed, on the 150 tax seats proposed by USAMV, seven of them in Agriculture, five in Horticulture and six in Zoothehnie.
Drivers are afraid to enter the wheels of cars in the cracks on the Tudor Vladimirescu Bridge
The bridge over Bahu on Tudor Vladimirescu's boulevard was as full of horror as when "Iasi's Day" wrote about the problems they presented, ten days ago.
Our daily reporters then signaled that the axis delimiting the two directions of walking asphalt was left, defending the deep corners, some even 20 centimeters, by which concrete plates representing the primary infrastructure of the bridge are seen.
The asphalt also began to fissure on one side and on the other side of the axis, pre-denting signs that the depths will increase.
At that time, the interim mayor Mihai Chirica states that the bridge has no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise, with a view to launching a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tramway, worth EUR 5 million.
Mayor Chirica states that the area affected by cracks and groups will be signalled, and asphalt restoration works will be carried out quickly.
But the only measures taken so far have been the setting up of a number and a signaling band, without even making a simple lead.
In this period, we have focused more on opening the school and the work needed for this purpose.
"There's an on-the-spot expert that we're waiting for in about a week with the details needed for the intervention, I appreciate that in no more than two weeks we can move on to remedy the situation," said the interim mayor.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
Preparatory class, how he's trying to improve the situation.
I don't know if to enjoy or let myself get sick of melancholy; tilt, passive, to the second variant.
First, because I have the feeling that it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took it for the first time, with emotions, to the garden.
Although it is light, no normal parent is happy to raise their children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then a story began that, at the top, didn't end until today.
I wasn't even what is usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But I always liked school.
So much so that I've chosen to continue to frequent it, even as a teacher.
When I decided that's what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And no one with any stakes.
That's because, like each one of us, I've given all over the kind of teachers: better or worse, nicer or insufferable, smarter or just imbecile.
Unfortunately, there are people with other calls in this bracelet.
I think they're toxic, because they hurt enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I was lucky to give, while I was a student or a student, over a few, few, exceptions.
These meetings can be decisive if they happen at the right time.
Whoever believes that the role of the cathedral is trivial transmission of information is annoyance.
That's what anyone can do; informed, they can tell the student very well by themselves, that we only live in the age of transparency.
A good teacher, however, molds the mind of the students.
They form them, they plan their thinking.
Staying in the chair is not a privilege, as I think it is, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very moftrous, demanding, unforgivable and always willing to look for the hives of their faces.
That's how they say their age, their temperament.
In adolescence, we all thought we knew everything, that we had doubts about anything.
When we grow up, we get to understand that we have only doubts.
That's why a teacher's role is to get the adolescent out of his self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, he starts to doubt, ask questions.
To discover on their own the answers, whether they or the provisionals.
Get involved in everything he does.
Make it discreet to profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially that most of the time the student believes the teacher is his enemy.
One who's barely waiting to catch him on the wrong foot to sanction him.
But that leads him, the pure, uncomprehensible, rebellious, to live full of his old calls, to look at the one from the chair with suspicion.
He just can't accept his attempt to order it.
Adolescents are not allowed to set up, they do not agree to be restricted.
Or, if they look like they do, they get revenge.
And, unfortunately, when in the chair there is a rigid person, who is imposed by harshness and does not communicate, the students take revenge on the object taught.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with great writers, for example, because of the lack of touch of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who feel that history is a mix of data, that mathematics is all that can be more annoying for their unspoiled mind.
I always urge my students: if you give up a teacher you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him remove you from the literature to which you should be directed.
How did it happen that I became the mother myself?
I had a very good teacher in VI-VIII.
He opened my mind to some texts that spoke to the puberty ever since on his understanding.
I've met, in high school, a university professor who opened the door to his library.
I was looking at him as a man from another world: he had the walls of the house covered with embroidered shelves of books.
I was losing myself in his library and I was dreaming of having one the same.
Now I may have it, but if I didn't get it in my way, maybe I'd make myself a football player.
Or engineer or lawyer or who else knows what.
I don't think such encounters are random.
I don't believe in Hazard.
Essentially, you're going over the man who takes you by hand and patiently points you toward your own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me only discuss what it means to teach literature.
It's just that literature can't be handed over.
There is no professor of literature, as there is a professor of mathematics.
How do you fix the ineffable concept?
You can, at the very least, approach it, without the claim that you transmit stoned truths.
The one in the chair can at most guide the reading, that's something else.
But most of all, it can take some miraculous encounters between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, which can lift him up, talk to someone, eyebrows.
Therefore, the professor of literature must first of all be able to get students to understand (sense) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great cosseur, Al. Paleologu, says one thing just apparently paradoxical: "How literature, so life, not vice versa!" and he was right.
That's why a good boy prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Luckily, we always have to learn something.
And we, the teachers; or especially us, the teachers.
Most times, it only repeats from inertia a great truth: not only the disciples have to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a teacher, and the student a student.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
I can't find him, he's right.
But the master was the one who lit the spark.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a pure blood teacher than to endure as many such separations.

If FIFA is extended
Justice in the USA and Switzerland will lead to new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal prosecutions will begin in the case of new persons and organisations, in the FIFA corruption investigation, inform the international press.
American Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced, Monday, at a press conference held in Zürich, that the area of investigations into the corruption of the world football was enlarged.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will engage in additional prosecutions at new individuals and new organizations," Lynch said.
In May, more FIFA leaders were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extradited to the United States.
"We have hope that other people who have been criminally followed will reach the U.S.," Lynch added.
Switzerland's Attorney General, Michael Lauber, also at the press conference, said that his institution has put several properties, including houses and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the investigation carried out in collaboration with the USA.
"I didn't even get to the end of the first shot," Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information, 11 terabytes, has been confiscated.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are investigated.
The investigators also entered into an agreement to assign media rights to the 2010 World Cups from South Africa and from 2014 to Brazil.
FIFA faces a great scandal of corruption, after American justice accused 14 people, including two FIFA Vice-Presidents and seven fora officials.
Persons held are researched for bribes and other benefits, from the early 1990s and so far, totalling over $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced, in early July, that he resigns from the office of FIFA president, after he was re-elected for the fifth time.
Beats like movies at the theater
In the Supekombat Gala from Milan, the ex-Catalin Moroșanu will fight the "beast" James Wilson
A number of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Catalin Moroșanu, will participate on 2 October at the Superkombat Gala at the Milan Linear 4 Ciak Theatre, the last before the final in November, is shown in a press release MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as we promised, we will return this fall with a new five-star gal.
If we still chose an unpublished venue, a theater, then we promise to fight as in movies.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters on the event schedule.
In addition to games with already consecrated celebrities, we will have another gala in the opening, which will include the best fighters in the new generation, among which Romanians Cristis Spetcu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"It will soon be announced and the full program," said promoter Eduard Irimia.
Catalin Moroșanu will fight in the Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination Galle with American James Wilson, known after 2012 participated in the last pyramid in the heavy category organized in Japan and numerous awards from the bodybuilding concussions.
I'm just waiting to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm tearing him down!
I'm still upset that last year I couldn't fight at the end, so now I'm gonna get revenge on him.
"Of the beast turns him into a kitten," said Moroșanu.
Unbeated in 2015, the Andrei and Bogdan Stoica brothers will have in Italy the latest confrontations before fighting for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, both of them went through KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm glad I'm back in Italy, last year's atmosphere was incredible.
"I'm just waiting to meet the fans there and promise them a new surprise," said World Champion Andrei Stoica.
In Milan will fight and Raul Cătinaș with an opponent to be established.
A little girl invited the Queen of England on her day, but also argued in her letter
A young girl from Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for her longest reign, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to Buckingham Palace when she went to visit him with her family.
The letter was not left without an echo, but the little girl received an answer from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for the invitation, but she also apologized that she would not be able to be present on 27 September, she even hated having fun with family and friends.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited to a talkshow shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died from heart.
The fate of Adrian Păunescu and Vadim Tudor is similar.
Both of them were writers and politicians and both of them went off at close, heart-to-heart ages.
Adrian Păunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died on a TV reality show.
Vadim Tudor, full of verbs, ironed Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, the Minister of Tourism of the time, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor said, with his smile on the joke, to Adrian Păunescu: "I'm envious of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
He said, "It's not too commendable what you told me now."
Adrian Păunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died today, September 14, 2015, at the age of 65.
Two Inconsistencies after an ACCIDENT in Dumbrava

A biker was taken up by a Volkswagen autoturism.
The cyclist was not observed by the driver.
Fortunately, they're both stable.
Following the impact, the windshield and the mirror of the car were broken.
Two injured people are unconscious at the time of transmission of this news.

A Syrian artist turned "Super Mario" into a refugee
A Syrian artist created a version with refugees of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the plight of his countrymen, on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Puppets, the modified video game has in the center of the "Mio Refugee".
The character is trying to move from human traffickers and border police, on its way to a European Union refugee centre.
The artist established in Istanbul uses Samir al-Mufti's pseudonym for security reasons and said he made the video game with the Mario refugee after his friends ventured on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of war.
At the Craiova detention center the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Center, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I, and the eldest is 25 years old and is in class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a centre belonging to the National Penitentiary Administration to try to draw attention, and thus to less known realities.
The youngest, 15-year-old, is enrolled in class I, and the largest is 25 years old and is enrolled in class XI.
"There are complicated subjects that society is concerned to discuss at this time, we are all struck by our own concerns and problems, but we must not pass with the view of the lesson that these more than 100 young people in the Craiova Detention Center offer," said Minister Robert Casanciuc, on Monday at the school opening festival.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material possibilities, can lead to tragedies, stating that young people in this centre would have another chance in life if they could have followed the school course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, and receive a set of moral values, to find out what it means to respect the law and what consequences it can have.
"The role of the prison system is not to isolate people from society who have violated the law, to shut them behind high walls, but to try to re-create them and prepare them, so that when they return to the community to have more chances of reintegration," said Casanciuc.
The Minister stated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system, because, in many cases, detention conditions are at the limit of humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and thanks to this partnership, every year, in the prison system, there are more than 2000 graduates of school education.
Obviously, we won't be able to change over the night that hasn't been done 25 years, but there are important steps we're taking.
"In all these moves we also need to support society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and are no danger to society," said Casanciuc.
The Minister of Justice has hated the success of both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the combined effort of all.
"And because today is the feast of the Holy Cross, I would launch all students and teachers the invitation to visit the mausoleums of the Soviet, Mother and not only, to understand what it means to young people fight for ideals," said Robert Casanciuc.
A Russian came to the vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be dissolved!
Request for prestigious university in Iasi and the country
Over 200 researchers, university frameworks, personalities and students in the country have signed a petition launched by the Academy Society of Romania requesting the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even defiance of doctoral schools in Romania "who permit and promote academic taxation".
Among the signing of the petition launched on 10 September are also educational frameworks and teachers in Iasi.
Among the university signatories of the petition in the academic environment, for example, is Professor Liviu Antonesee.
At the national level, the petition has names from former ministers of education, such as Mircea Miclea, to people of culture who are also teaching academic university, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Law of Education provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been carried out so far, thus leading to the lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools that flagrantly violate ethical rules in scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance", the application states.
That petition specifically requires compliance with the Law of National Education, assessment of doctoral schools, suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school in which more than two plagiarisms have been found until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school where there is no minimum number of doctoral conductors provided for by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Council for Scientific Research in 2011 for eligibility for grants of projects of type IDEI.
Do you less respect a general without a PhD, or a politician, or an information agent in the Middle East?
"Why does there not exist in Europe other academics that are organized by secret services, and the top military that give their doctorate do it to autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academy Society, initiator of the petition, originating from Iasi.
This can be completed by all applicants on the Company’s Internet page, and the final signatures will be filed by the organization at the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "For Iasi" party, founded by young managers of political non-affiliated IT, was launched the other day in Copou Park.
The chairman of the "For Iasi" Initiative Group gave an interview to "Iasi Journal"
Iaşul will have a party dedicated exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of entrepreneurs and non-political managers so far launched at the end of last week the Party for Iasi organisation that will propose candidates to local elections in 2016.
Currently, the party's core is made up of IT specialists, but training initiators say that all people who want to get involved in modernising the city are welcome in the organization.
The launch took place on Saturday in Copou Park, and at the event more than 200 sympathizers were attended, almost all of them young.
The special guest of the action was Nicușor Dan, president of the Association Save Bucharest.
He was surprised at the local elections in 2012, when, from an independent position, he managed to gather 10% of the votes of the cheerleaders for the mayor of the capital.
"The people I've seen at "For Iasi" I think they're very good at accessing the Iaş public administration."
I believe in this initiative, I think he has a chance, I think he might have more chances in a community than in Bucharest.
"I'll always be with "For Iasi," said Nicușor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iasi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: Reasons are more sentimental and emotional.
I was gone on many short business trips, I also lived a year in Cluj.
I came back every time, because I felt that this is my house.
ZDI: Why have you decided now to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache: Now we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have begun to know each other for some time.
We met in professional settings, started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we were more timid, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various construction or charitable actions, and, somehow, things have evolved naturally and organicly and now it has happened to be the time when we came to the decision that we need to involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects for the efficiency of the local public administration activity!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum of information on the city's activities so that the different departments, institutions and kings cooperate as well.
But more importantly, we can publish transparent data on the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects etc. We are talking about information organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular neighborhood, it is important to consult the public of the people affected.
If we speak of efficiency, we must not forget the common transport, we have the worst buses in the country.
New means of transport must be bought.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city matters extremely much.
How would you promote Jaşul?
Andrei Postolache: You get on the plane and you're looking for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can "sell" the city.
You need to do this and know how to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we bring customers to Iasi.
What is the brand of Iash?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we have to be a city of technology in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we have to expand it, go to medicine, enter the robotics area, in the 3D printing area, continue in this spirit and unite such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I refer here to the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Iaşu already has a historical brand that must not be changed, namely the cultural city.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration as well as the lack of traditional party structures with which elections are still being won in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, working with people and carrying out projects.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we won't just stay on Facebook, we're not online party.
We don't want to have "voluntary" brought with the bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there are enough people that way.
ZDI: Should Iaş Mayor be more concerned with promoting the image of the city nationally and internationally, or is it necessary for the area of concern to be permanently edilitary?
Andrei Postolache: One without another does not work.
First of all, you need to solve today's problems, the emergencies.
Or, if you don't make your town known, if you don't attract money in town, at a time you're out of money and you won't be able to make, for example, streets.
They must both be done at the same time and they must be competent people next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the mayor-tattoo model, which comes and knocks with the fist in the table and solves everything.
No. No.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We look for people who want to do something good, have an unswerving reputation, be clear in integrity and be honorable.
From this point of view, we have no other filter.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, he established the Introspecials company after, for seven years, he was director of the Endava international issue (2008 - 2015), where he coordinated a team of 300 people.
Another four years (2003 - 2007) spent at Synygy.
The company that established it with another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
The tractor Rabla program turned out to be a failure
Director General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said the Program to stimulate the renewal of the national park of tractors and agricultural machinery, initiated in 2011, also known as Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to red tape.
All related to the Rabla Programme, there were some trials in recent years, but it proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a farmer in line, and the approvals were far too long-lasting, and then the world gave up.
Through that program it was able to sell somewhere at 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," said Mircea Oltean.
According to him, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces a few hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by firms from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It's a great competition with those coming from outside, all the world's producers have put their eyes on Romania, I know these things I've told you, and they have special policies.
"On all trades there is a big agglomeration, all the producers expose, come with all kinds of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who indicated that IRUM Reghin annually produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors.
Through the Tractors Rabla program, initiated in 2011, those holding old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as combos, could surrender and instead receive a voucher of 17,000 lei.
Red flag has been raised
The internal election of workers seems more spectacular and more politically significant, as the new leader elected automatically becomes his peak of launch in future elections.
Rise, therefore, the red-burned drape/under his skirts we will live and die.
That was what Jeremy Corbyn was singing yesterday in London's Sanctuary House.
He's been testifying to many facts and vows. Let's not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial British and international left immn (Red Flag/ The Red Flag) can search the internet and would not be excluded from having a surprise.
With our heads discovered, let's all swear that we'll wear it until we crash.
The author of these ranks is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and not of those who float them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn manages to join the left of yesterday's tomorrow, this love story between him and the Laburist Party base will have part of a happy-end.
I don't think that's gonna happen like this, but it seems to me premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat, over five years, of a leader chosen the other day.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have witnessed a democratic exercise of an impressive scope.
The British Labour have not invented the voting system directly for the party leader, among the western left.
A more complicated system, based on motions, which allows the expression of all members and supporters, has been in practice for a few years; in addition, they organised a preliminary competition for the appointment of the candidate to the 2012 presidentials.
However, the internal election of workers seems more spectacular and more political, as the new leader elected automatically becomes his peak of launch in future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of the political system, the customisation of power being more pronounced in the UK than on the other side of the Hand Channel.
In addition, participation in the vote was high in all three "searches": members themselves, members of the unions and other organisations affiliated to the party and, finally, the group of supporters (who received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This last group gives us interesting information about the perceptions of left-wing segments of British society, especially those of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to become more involved in the future, precisely because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are no, as far as I know, sociological surveys that tell us too much about the attitudes of this laborer "external quest", so the precaution speculation is allowed.
I think we have a lot of attitudes similar to those of the supporters Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will travel through the traditional channels of the left.
If we have to identify a "antisystem" vocation, it is primarily reflected by rejecting the centrist line, New Labour (for many, just a dissimulated form of much-thochcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty by the two successive election failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go left enough, that they were not firmly delimited by the Tony Blair era.
The second feature - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum on independence of Scotland.
If we separate from the separatist message and focus strictly on aspirations for other political issues, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of social-friendly segments of the public, animated by the aspirations of equity, disarmament and hostile to military involvement over theft, but also sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
Scottish workers have thus lost an electorate to whom they should have, at least in principle, had privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm towards Corbyn's campaign).
Such energies exist everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, the laborer's "aristocrat."
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the one with the left anti-system from the southern periphery of Europe.
The term "anti-system" is too harsh: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
Until next week we'll find out more about Jeremy Corbyn's first step as the leader of the opposition.
We will see if the red flag will not arise in the House of Commons (it would not be for the first time), after the new leader will have occupied his place, first of all, the opposition banks.
However, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is primarily unity - and in this regard he even has reasons to be worried.
Capable handling with or without good science
While I wrote the article went through my head to check the story of the former fighter on the net and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated to V. Marin's "Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - they could themselves make me from the beginning circumspect).
I didn't.
In the article last week (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") we commented in parallel two photos - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean and the one, in fact: the two looking at the Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh took it from the article "Syrian fighters come with the valley of refugees" (signified by Viorica Marin in the Truth of September 3rd).
Monday night, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among other things, a handle shot from the friend (not just the FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscription, except a precision. Laith of Saleh is not jihadist".
On the contrary, he's a fighter against Al Assad, for democracy and those.
"So you could add and manipulate rudely in the painting"!
I have to admit, I felt bad.
All the more as I wrote the article went through my head to check on the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated to V. Marin's "Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - they could themselves make me from the circumspect start).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
On the spot, then I had no other comment on the handle shot from Marius Cristian than that: "I need it if I believe in the Truth"
After that, I obviously took the story from money and I feel indebted to readers with the correct presentation of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh's story.
The oldest I found in a material by the Associated Press (Syrian rebel leader Seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader is looking for Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos of Greece, where they noticed, among hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man trying to order in the chaos of the crowd.
The man was Syrian writer Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who "is used to be in command", since he "led a unit of 700 rebels in the Syrian civil war."
We also find that 30-year-old Al Saleh had "a home, a wife and a normal life before he started the fight that cost over 250,000 lives and put a third of the people of Syria on his way."
In the interview with the Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh tells us that "everybody wants to leave Syria."
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of Islamic States) wants me, and the government wants me to fight everyone.
Beyond the fact that he was kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a more sinister meeting - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Now two days, I saw a sniper from government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very upset.
From the material we also find that Laith (which means a lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to the Netherlands, where he had a cousin - he was a senior officer in the Syrian army and then he became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was severely injured - hoping to get asylum and then bring his family - his wife and a three-year-old boy (almost an age with the Syrian civil war, which broke out in March 2011).
After this was accomplished, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue the fight for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by Russians), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated Al-Qaeda.
Crazy - whoever wants freedom has to fight against not one enemy in Syria but three!
I also went over a Serb material on August 22, of which I didn't understand much, just that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists coming along with migrants: TERORISTI SE KRIJU MEGUEU MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/dresses, in which they are joined a picture of Al Saleh with a beard holding a Syrian flag in their hand and that of the refugee wearing the THANK YOU shirt.
On September 7, then, on the BBC site itself, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation using photos with the Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely claimed to show an IS figter pose as a refuge - This viral photo wrongly claims to be a fighter of the Islamic State putting in refugee.
We find that the picture (in fact: the photos - the one with Laith with beard and gun and the one with THANK YOU shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have and apologize in the meantime.
Only before that, only from his wall, the picture with the two pictures would have been wiped out more than 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That's too late, the horse had gone!
In Romania, on 9 September, Carla Dinu from Hotnews took up the story with the BBC manipulation, however, translating the title: "A false photo became viral shows an ISIS fighter giving himself as a refugee."
Obviously, not the photograph is false, but the interpretation was a false, wrong, short, manipulative.
21-year-old champion
Winner in the Iaş Rali, Simone Tempestini secured his national title at the rally, becoming the youngest graduate in the history of the championship
The Iasi Cotnari 2015 rally ended with a result of young pilot Simone Tempestini, Italian with Romanian citizenship, who won all the new special samples of the most difficult stages of the National Ralis Championship.
Being even now the leader in competition, Simone became with a stage before the end, national champion, having joined co-pilot Dorin Pulpea on a Ford Fiesta R5.
Junior Tempestini became the youngest Romanian rally champion, the previous recordman in 2011, belonging to Valentin Porcișteanu (28 years and nine months).
At the seven stages of the National Dunlop Ralis Championship, Simone won 47 special samples, and the performance at Iasi re-edits on the previous one, from the Arad Raliul.
In the second place, at Iasi he ranked Simone's father, Marco Tempestine (copilot, Anton Avram, all Fiord Fiesta R5, all from the Napoca Rally Academy Cluj, and in the third place he ranked as the Hungarian team Gergö Szabo - Karoly Borbely on a Mitubishi Lancer Evo IXO, performance that rises on the second place in the general ranking.
In class III, Edwin Keleti won, followed by Manuel Mihalache and Dan Gârtofan, and in category two motor wheels won Adrian Răspopa.
Other winners were Adrian Dragan (Cupa Dacia) and Vlad Cosma (Cupa Suzuki).
The outgoing team Dan Iamandi - Răzvan Subtirelu abandoned during the special period of the eighth.
I've been through the whole range of lives this time.
"The positive reaction of the Federation's pilots and officials makes me hope that we will also be in this year's champion at the organisation," ralian manager Dan Codreanu said.
The Iaşu Raliul Cotnari was organized by XS Motorsport (manager, Dan Codreanu) in partnership with the Cotnari Company, Iași City Hall, International Hotel, Ford Iași - ATI Motors Holding, with the support of the Silvice Iași Directorate, the Judicial Police Inspectorate, the Judetian Inspectorate of Jandarmi, the Emergency Situation Inspectorate, the Ambulance Service of the Judicial Council, and the Iași County Prefecture.
