Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped on Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a windsuit (a combination equipped with wings), it went up to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate shrine, located more than 3,000 metres high, where many crowds had gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While the planners of the U.S. road network have difficulty finding the money needed to repair the self-infrastructure in decreptitude, many are those who come up with a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above the board of your car.
The aircraft, which registers all thousands of cars and transmits information to civil servants, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the government planning offices to reverse the obsolete financing system on major American roads.
The generally uninterested sector in the planning of the major axes has suddenly led to a strong debate and to a movement of alliances.
The liberators joined environmental groups to press for the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly of the road you travel on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
Tea Party landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are unable to agree on whether to continue, several States have not expected.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of thousands.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental transfer.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It's not like we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, who expects the state to start recording the thousands of routes by every Californian car by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed by the taxes that Americans pay for the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while petrol prices are high.
"The gasoline tax is simply not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His State has recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a payment system by mile.
"It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wunks calls this the cost of using the mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces urban Liberals, since taxes could be used to modify driving habits in order to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California's planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set by the State's ambitious laws on climate warming.
But Mr. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said that he also saw it as the most viable alternative in the long term.
The open market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of getting drivers to pay by mile.
"It's not just a tax swallowing in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of the policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for their benefits.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the way to payment by mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which would have carried about 10,000 cars.
But the House Presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to go to work or in town.
However, several States and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the state of charge kilometres instead of petrol taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States away from the coast is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studying how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their minor actions and actions.
"The concerns about Big Brother and these kinds of things are a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategic management of performance at the Nevada Transport Department.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full-scale localization devices."
There is no need to build a huge and bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of the people's daily trips and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now moving to find an affordable technology that would enable the State to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small start-up in California named True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to States.
It sought to break into the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices that it tests have a great deal of focus on the planners because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive means and methods that are much less intrusive to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try to experiment by offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any equipment at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles run by all residents of the state.
Other States hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport operators are seeking to develop a charging device that would also be equipped to pay parking charges, provide "duty payment" insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Automobilists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," said a paper on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the entire debate on payment by mile is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say that Congress could simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
A single or additional annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays his fair share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the Director of Law and Public Affairs at the Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four unprecedented listening
The English musician did not finish to surprise this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he concluded a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unpublished ones.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of David Bowie's release of a new album had left everyone in the pantomime.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he stated that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that one could still rely on him to spark the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to re-edit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he had a real feast for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will appear in the form of three discs: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a notebook to share its own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, above all, it gives a foretaste of its new atomic title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a savanticly mastered rock electricity.
Unpublished people already listening
But Atomic is not the only title to reveal his charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: an alarming intro before a light riding that slows progressively to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, Bowie wanted to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, even to Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, by the way, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie again referred to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The riffs of guitar, enthusiasts, give the desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie is having fun playing the chameleon with these titles: turn-in informant, man aboard a rocket, potential marc...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, he plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the L'Invitation au Voyage campaign, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face is framed.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast as of 10 November.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that injured soldiers were not sumptuously released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not comply with the "university of service" rule of the army requiring staff to be able to perform a number of varied tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London reservist in Ontario, has been released from the army despite his request to stay another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary commission last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not respond to the universal service rule.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with La Presse Canadienne on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been unable to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in ranks but who are not fit for the fight.
Under the current rules, severely injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year to Parliament indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 did not reach the required length of service to obtain retirement benefits.
The Liberal Spokesperson for Veterans, Jim Karygiannis, asked for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while the neo-Democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney put on the tablets to launch a animated series
The American Disney Media and Entertainment Group has decided to focus the tablets on its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is only planned in 2014, detailing the release of Disney Junior Division.
The cartoon, intended for children 2-7 years old, tells the adventures of Callie, sheriff of a city in the U.S. west where she makes the order with a magical laxo.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice President of Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the communiqué.
This kind of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the life of his series and build new relationships with his audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important," he added.
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age were already using a tablet or a telephone, and 72% of children under 8 years old, respectively 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, U.S. Information Services Denouncer, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday Mr Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been obviously positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. Government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany was tested as a result of complaints that the NSA had overheared the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who led the parliamentary group that oversees foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States", he had to take advantage of it.
Mr. Ströbele, German Green MP, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
On his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele stated that, according to the counsel of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden was testifying in Germany, he should be assured that he would be in "safety" there, the Member said.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he had been subjected to a "severe and sustained" campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression."
Citizens from all over the world, as well as senior officials – including the United States – felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public use.
The letter made an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Câble subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix video service via their television in a future that does not seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary reported on Thursday that she was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and more options," explained Cogeco's president and CEO Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Câble so engrosses the step to its competitors, like Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary still has no specific date in relation to this new platform.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Rogers Telecommunications Manager already indicated that he could offer Netflix if some technical details, which were not cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable distributors to make its service available via their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Speech from the Throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wishes to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for à la carte services.
"It's been about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain packages, it doesn't work," said Mr.Audet.
However, he hopes that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CCTC) will result in interesting recommendations.
"There must emerge from these discussions a new kind of reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television," said Cogeco, Fr.
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated that it had recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ per share.
This is a reduction compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢ per share, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decrease due to depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Companies, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's incomes, they experienced an increase of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to up to 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢ per share, in decline compared to 45.7 million, or 93 ¢ per share, of the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable's revenues, however, increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet doesn't worry about seeing the number of clients fluctuating like that.
For me, this is not the indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very intense competition.
Horse in beef products
Horsemeat was detected in beef-based cans sold by two small British low-priced distribution teachers, today announced the food hygiene agency.
Routine tests revealed that the products, produced in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA of 1 to 5%.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France has been the most affected country by the presence of this type of meat in products deemed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles struck four wounded on road 131 in Lanaudière earlier Friday.
Just before 4h, a car driver traveling north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car arriving in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The traffic returned to normal around 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Border Airlines plans to have hand baggage paid
Border Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in his announcement on Wednesday, she indicated that passengers could take the open cane with them to the descent of the plane.
The new hand luggage charges concern bags in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Border said it would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if the travellers paid only once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay for the costs in advance.
"We do not want to pay this price," she explained.
The airlines started paying for the first and second bags recorded in 2008.
Passengers who were trying to avoid these charges put as many things as they could in the hand luggage in the upper compartments, so there was often no place in these compartments.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley stated that these new expenses will not really be used to collect money.
It is about making Frontier's clients more loyal that it becomes increasingly difficult to find their place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a tail passenger at a Border boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier registration site and procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these costs before arriving at the door.
Frontier hand baggage charges will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often rumble about baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider adding baggage costs as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them have not been affected by baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such costs is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to the airlines Jay Sorensen, which follows the additional charges closely.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand baggage costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines framework, recently traveled to Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the costs of unusual hand luggage imposed by the company.
"I've never seen such a smooth boarding procedure of my entire career," he said.
I was waiting to see toothbrushes and a fight broke out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers are mounted on board at the speed of the lightning."
Border is also like Spirit and applies $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the open cane with them, and those who take coffee can be served for free.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after passengers complained and while no other large airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to pay for hand baggage when passengers do not purchase their tickets directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it started offering only half of thousands of loyalty to customers who bought their tickets via an online travel agency.
Wednesday, it reduced the premiums of thousands of 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250-mile.
It also allows passengers to choose their seats in advance only if they purchase their tickets directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in his home city, Denver, but his activity retreats and he loses money.
Revenues fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic tried to straighten out Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA is calling into question an "internal error" rather than computer pirates for the failure of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadows stated Friday that it was a bug that had caused the failure of its public site for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," the spy agency stated in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the failure was due to a disclaimer attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can't access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman explained.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to inundate a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-touching is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The previously ultra-secret NSA, once known as the No Such Agency, has been under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications monitoring programs at the national and foreign levels – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former NSA's obsolete consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused many speculations that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville Hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 still haven't found a new job.
Delta promises not to let her employees down.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, and they met with employees individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of Work Relations at the Hotel Delta, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta intervenes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvestted in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, owner of the Transat Travel Chair at the UQAM School of Science Management.
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the next few months, such as the Crown Plaza that will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling almost 600 rooms will see the day in two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employed"
After having thrown the sponge with failure in January for the partial recovery of the Goodyear website of North Amiens, Maurice Taylor, the U.S. tire CEO Titan, says he is ready to save 333 jobs on the 1,137 that the plant counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After giving up the plant's purchase project in January, you're coming back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "fous" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face-to-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours disabled in France.
In India, China and in many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a fair price and competent workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the plant's closing announcement, Goodyear had offered employees a good start-up allowance, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now let's imagine that Titan buys Goodyear the closed factory.
Therefore, Titan could move machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan commitment before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on starting allowances for all employees.
So there will be no more employees in the plant.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the factory's purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide job-life guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the plant, we have a strong intention of staying in North Amiens for more than four years.
The profit of Bombardier falling, while deliveries and aircraft orders shrink
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains Division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide on-the-fly test data for his new CSeries aircraft or any information to determine whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial service schedule by September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the latter flew only three times, and the question was then whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not in line with the forecast and the course of the actions fell by 8% to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from "super-performance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential of the stock exchange in the next quarter or the next two quarters.
"Although the decrease in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will record new orders for his CSeries planes as the flight testing program moves forward.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptic about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family can catapult it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has so far been modest to 177. Potential buyers seem to wait for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims about the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new line aircraft.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its objective of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft is put into business.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program was moving in accordance with the timetable.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's stopping time.
Each builder plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and plan for an up-to-date period, and that's what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly afterwards, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first client can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was assessing the schedule of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This flight test slower – although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal calendar – strengthens our view that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended on September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted action result remained unchanged to 9 cents.
Income declined slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 million.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer reported that he had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, compared to 57 one year earlier.
Net orders fell on 26 planes, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division was $32.9 Md as at 30 September, which was unchanged compared to the 31 December of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Aeronautic revenues dropped by 13% to $2 million.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that the income of this division had increased from nearly 11% to $2.1 million.
The Transport Division's order book totaled $32.6 million as at 30 September, a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered from performance problems with respect to some major contracts.
Leaders announced that further information would be provided in the fourth quarter.
The course of Bombardier's actions, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google Inc's financial management, would sit on the board of directors, dropped from 8.5% to $4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third aircraft manufacturer and competing closest to Bombardier, said on Thursday a 10% decrease in its quarterly profit.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists were missing in a gouffre under the Crolles' Dent since Thursday evening, they learned Friday from the Isère's Relief Speleo.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one war in practice and the other, left under ground Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
So we had no news from them since then, specified the same source.
"The speleologists should have emerged around 5:00 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Speleo rescue in charge of the relief organization.
Tens of people on site
About 20 rescuers, ten civilians members of the French Relief Speleo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon on Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the relief teams engaged in the network," says Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Mountain Hunters of Chambéry were found to be "exhausted but not wounded".
They lost themselves in the network, returned to their pace while waiting for relief, specified the prefecture.
Refuelled, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German Journalist Union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services on Thursday after further revelations on the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid the use of Google and Yahoo search engines and messages to the new order," she says in a communiqué.
It considers "scandalisers" the Washington Post information, according to which the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 members.
Reputed Time: A Member Requests Brigitte Gruwels to resign
Minister Brigitte Gruwels' project "relifting" signposts in Brussels does not please everyone.
To recall, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project to retain 16 points of signaling fire from the region to the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The goal being both "to increase security" and "brought identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all Brussels signaling lamps, at an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands Brigitte Gruwels' "dissemination".
"Not happy to spend the money of the Bruxellois madly in the raising of the colour-signalling poles of the Bruxelles Region, Brigitte Gruwels continues his Flemishing Operations of the Capital," said De Bock in a communiqué.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally repainted herself in dark blue-blue yellow-black Brussels poles.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselses deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who itself realizes the NVA program.
It's a great time to stop the Trojan horse from Flanders.
"To remember, Brigitte Gruwels was elected only with 2 245 votes or 0.5% of Brusselsers!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the portico of Pont-de-Bus demonté
The portico-taxe of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday morning, was dismounted.
cranes arrived in place shortly after 10 hours, and traffic on the national was diverted into the crowd.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefectures of the Finistère on Wednesday, was made by the company Ecomouv, the manager of the portico.
These are the last of the three eco-taxes to operate in the Finistère department, the two others having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of a accessories shop for Google Glass
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google signed glasses.
They can thus acquire a listener, a charger or even a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of microfibre or an intra-aural listener.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father wiped out the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him right now,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to keep on doing it.
There is no recipe, no mode of use to pass the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that never leaves me, placed on the night table.
It's the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my everyday gestures.
Our mother left us after her battle with cancer.
That's at least what I thought on the day I found her body empty, spitted on this hospital bed with cold sheets.
Similarly, his funerals were a glacial adieu focused around the thin light of candles that would fit his circle.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small day or night apparitions, a little shy, a little wiped out, she quickly returned to my mind, changing as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that thought was grieving.
And then she turned out to me while revealing my own faces that I had not yet perceived, hidden by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother's person, but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This tour of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that people who love us never leave us.
I look like my father, "in and out," he seemed.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a hard relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I wasn't afraid of him anymore, and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was wrong...
He was talking to me, constantly encouraging me, living my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I was able to have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It took a long time, and one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said that deceased people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always mean: what would they say? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night, but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it's too late, just, there's always something that keeps me from doing that.
I often wake up anxiously when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams lead me to the contrary and are part of my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the night of my ultrasound where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed that I would wake up, get out of bed, my father was waiting on the floor and he was smiling and happy that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he was sharing with me with joy what had come to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I am delighted to tell this common memory after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
Despite everything I've done my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to make a master's degree in a large school, were not, with the decline, anodising choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are always present, so that I can think about how she would want me to act at a certain time.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and rightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes laying on me.
My mother died 17 years ago.
Death after talking to me on the phone.
I have passed through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that only triggers, wherever, whenever, in unusual places, in incongruent moments.
Then, time has eased the pain.
The lack, the lack of response, the need for it, the need to entrust me, to reassure me of its sweetness.
Yet she's there, silent presence, she's there and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see his anxious eyes set upon me, I see the circles that gloat his gaze, the wrinkles around the lips that dig the cigarettes, the folds that mark the foreheads the days of trouble.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of my 3 children died of cancer at age 43.
We always feel its protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we were small and smiling again, and saying his name is no longer taboo but comfort.
Of course, I speak to her in the dark of the night when the absence is too bad, she invites herself in my dreams when the morale is a little hit.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the decline of time makes us realize how much she was head of the orchestra and we try to stay in the way she had tracked us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence can not remove it from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 after asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his inhumation and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I sometimes have my convictions different from hers, I always wonder if my actions are in line with her vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep, and I'm still wondering what he's going to think about.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is this genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
That was soon thirty years when my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years old.
The immense penalty that then invaded me has certainly mitigated, but it's always close to me.
Very often he "disembarked" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that awakening I am even more sad to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in surprise, anxious and lit up the hair lamp by looking everywhere, persuaded he was going to arrive.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I come back to see if it's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all the pieces I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we have been happy and or his mind lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since her departure, she is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I come out, I am grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the most deadly month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released its official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Prime Minister of Iraq is received by the President of the United States.
Noury al-Maliki wants US aid.
"We don't tell the world to be with us and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is going on in Iraq is not settled, it will spread, and what is going on in Syria will also spread.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Peace Institute, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded banners accusing, among others, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Detta, 42 years old, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed to the great day.
He was sentenced to three-year imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Assassin.
A major defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation, was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Detta, 42, provided sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after becoming engaged because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "primary file", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police hearing operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officials found Sarborough, 32 years old, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a bar dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in the context of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because she feared that her drug abuse would not be revealed in the day-to-day.
Today, at Liverpool's sitting court, Ditta, who works in the law firm Forbes Solicitors located in Blackburn, has fallen into disgrace after being convicted of two counts of impeachment in court after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Detta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him coming to Ditta's home and placing drugs, just 60%, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in phone contact with Detta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, a precinct of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug, and called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta collected his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a sample of hair was taken from him.
In an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that he was approached by clients for legal issues.
But the court heard testimony that it called for major actors in the drug trade, some of whom it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "If someone needs to know that they don't have to break the law, he's a criminal lawyer."
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will certainly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He stopped the police investigation as far as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Ditta did not honor her profession, but dishonored her.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he compromised his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, "Mr. Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal himself when he began to get drugs from criminal organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has forever compromised it and made it vulnerable to the background of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have commissioned it to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of confidence to the public.
Ditta betrayed this confidence and tried to get open behind the paints of her profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted an investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was convicted of the three heads of cocaine possession and now being held in detention, bearing in mind his commitment to prosecuting criminals in court.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after having pleaded guilty of complicity of trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a session of questions/answers about himself in which he said that his dream job would be a lawyer to represent clients on the death row in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be back on stage in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the queen of the soul will occur on December 21st at the Sound Board at the Hotel MotorCity Casino.
In November, Ms. Franklin was involved in recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect had stated to the media on 16 October that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of his Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaboard covered with a light mantle: you could stir the heat in Menton with the bill of lighting.
An invoice which, contrary to many municipalities, is also regulated by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To alleviate its costs, the city uses aid.
But also a different management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a gun
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 in the morning when a man opened the fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 injured.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the author of the fire.
The incident would have occurred at terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff have flocked to the exits or to the tarmac.
Very quickly the police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being stopped.
Classic song for teenagers
Every time, the school clientele will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five saynthes imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, cartoons with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to appreciate the classical song.
In addition to this show, the King's lyric Art Society will return with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now makes room filled at the Pulperia of Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, which gives artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, the lyrical Aperio, the concert-beneficie held last August, with the competition of the soprano colorature Marie-Éve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as soft in the ears as an air of The Whistle.
Without giving specific figures, the president of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precarious lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well developed, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
"The finances are floating and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operate, a step that we will take in seven years," said the administrator.
"I would say even beyond," added the general director, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy de Surrey school faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying weapons in a dangerous purpose, abduction, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Package.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective appeal against Saint Croix Brothers
A new application for collective appeal was filed against Sainte-Croix brothers regarding sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at Saint-Joseph's oratory, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J. J"., which was allegedly masturbed in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Submitis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph's oratory, where he was serving as a Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was only about three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people told us, "I, I was in this place, can I register?", explains lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective remedy that has just been filed is a particular provision for the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 persons who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also emphasizes that the congregation of Saint Croix and the Saint-Joseph oratory, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they were "knowing of the sexual abuse and have nevertheless choked them", and that they have "similarly and consciously chosen to ignore the problem."
These charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers Sainte-Croix, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research carried out in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective appeal must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility of the Court is accepted, the second stage shall be held, or the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle in a friendly manner before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in the boaring of LaSalle, Montreal, on Thursday night to Friday.
The rescue was called around 1h, Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on the avenue Dollard, near the intersection with the street Rejane.
The 30 firefighters who were dispatched to places have spent about an hour in control of the brasier.
The fire caused "significant damage to the structure of the building," the Chief of Operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but about twenty houses, located on the first and second floors of this range of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments might have to be temporarily registered, said SIM.
A lot of opposition to medical help to die at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the bill on medical assistance to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, as well as being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesperson from the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the emphasis was on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If adopted, Alberte Derry is concerned about the consequences of the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
Most palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice President of the Palliative Care Houses Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be unnecessary in any way.
We never ask ourselves, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Association des care palliatives de l'Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec Bill disorients the population regarding the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will take the lead.
On the other hand, the Liberal MP of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, states that the concept of end-of-life must be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press is ignoring the controversial media law
"It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask itself: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper by challenging the bill and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we refuse it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent news radio stations and websites.
He said that the new media court "will always be a party as it is a government extension" and that the restrictions on content and advertising would affect Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to "hold it on the media." The Standard stated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had a hard blow" and flogged the bill calling it "draconian".
The adoption of the bill also involves a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate mall last September.
Kenyan media stirred up the anger of the authorities by broadcasting images of surveillance video cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack were de-robaning so-called the luxury shopping center.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question them, although the call was withdrawn following a riot of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "radiated" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "liver blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"To themselves, political men would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and picking."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of people's anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Wages Commission and restored their outstanding salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-free – which are among the highest in the world.
A hard year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Social Health and Services Centre (CSSS) in Laval caused a whole stir in the management of the Hospital de la Cité-de-la-Santé in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement, maternity leave, or short leave, the pharmacy department has found itself very deficient in staff.
Almost 30% of the necessary staff were missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to engage in independent labour, which may cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
There was no use of landfill, Ms. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or reduced for a period of time.
Of course, we worked hard to interest our young people [pharmaceutical residents] to get them to come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 clearly announced itself easier for the Department of Pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain them bore fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval also decided to remain in the use of the CSSS.
Now, it's going a lot better, the pharmacist pointed out.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures last year.
Always Growing Needs
The situation, however, remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the trade, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have a environment that is young and we employ many young women, so with the pregnancies, we almost always drive to three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and there are no pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The top 22-year-old model doesn't start his career at the cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose it to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This porn drama, in eight chapters that will emerge in two sections (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadrant that has grown to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's appearance with his elder is striking: a toast silhouette, a diaphane dye and French-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one that had not hesitated to put nude on ice paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on large screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac caused the temperature to rise on the Canvas: Stacy Martin appears in the bed and in the open-air with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their powder in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the doubling.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsburg, passing by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of pushing her actresses in their last retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room at the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday evening
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following fingering at the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility ordered the evacuation of the room and warned firefighters for a suspected smell.
About 70 people left the meeting.
The persons were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad jokes on the bottom of the lacrymogen jet?
Or involuntary incident?
It is always because film management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its clients in full.
The room was airborne and everything went in order.
The cinema was able to resume its rights and customers find the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into citrus fruit
On the day of Halloween, a woman tried to bring two kilos of cocaine hidden into the country in citroules, Thursday morning, at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of passenger luggage that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been distributed in three pre-filled citrus fruit.
The drug was then transported to the office of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) that took over the relay in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, spokesperson for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that she arrived in the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have had 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region completed a total of 1653 drug seizures.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday at the beginning of the afternoon, but strikes took place during the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 air-soil missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of Tsahal's aircraft into Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in approximately the same circumstances as the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous U.S. leader who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting the Jakhont Solemn missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation from seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered Ukraine's solvency note Friday, questioning the capacity of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt securities note goes to "B-", which is embedded in the speculative investment category.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least one chance over three that it will again be reduced in a year's time.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign exchange to meet its high external funding needs," the U.S. agency says.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits made abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities make massive use of to support the local currency, hryvnia, collapseing, the agency is increasingly considering a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of fierce tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth trimester of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates 33.5% of GDP, against less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been calling for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 granted it a appropriation of $15.3 billion and has now released only 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "the important external financing needs" were "vulnerability", while "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect a short-term improvement."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with presidential elections scheduled in 2015, the expert was interviewed at the PSA.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels provides for the release of opponent Iulia Timochenko.
"To sign the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," S&P explained, who feared "commercial restrictions" on Moscow's part.
Russia, which represents the fourth of Ukrainian exports, warned that in the event of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
United States Green Fire at the Merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicists and Omnicom said on Friday that they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first world advertising agency.
The merger approaches the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the time-limit for reviewing the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", both groups announce in a communiqué.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the period of review provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the implementation of the transaction.
"The merger is also conditioned to obtain other regulatory authorities and to approve the shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolese army hunts down the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to hunt down the rebels of the M23 up to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the point of being beaten after being expelled from the northeastern regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that it had been controlling the insurrection since the beginning 20 months ago.
"We're going to pursue the M23 and take him anywhere he hides because he's a criminal," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokeswoman of the FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
Time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, stated on RFI that these military reversings would in no way alter his claims to peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Affixes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of M23 occurred in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the head of the North Kivu province, benefiting from the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade consisting of South African, Malawin and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC headquarters was remanded and the army moved to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to reach its end," predicted an expert on Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government managed to beat a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
Experts from the United Nations accused Rwanda of military support for the M23, which was originally made up of former Congolese military mutinies.
British diplomatic leader William Hague invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to take the lead, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals following shells in Rwandan territory.
Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to salute the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to be one day released by the army," a resident of this neighbouring village of Uganda testifies.
"We lived in terror (from M23), we were traumatized," he added.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the coronary virus proved negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already caused some 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second American oil company, reported on Friday a decline in its quarterly profit due to the decrease in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining in decline compared to the Group's objectives.
Its net profit in the third quarter has fallen to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 billion per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year ago.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, increasing from 2.52 million bpj produced a year ago.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Owing to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday a net profit falling, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
Since the beginning of the school year of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students receiving school transport at two residences, the organization has provided a service when it is in a position to do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," says Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested further time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to get together and find solutions," says Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency of the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the leaf that had been carried out for several months by a part of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, Health Minister Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "make time for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date for the closure of emergencies that will not be able to take place on 4 November".
An official request "to take no risk of emergency management in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed not to disturb the PS campaign to a few months from the municipalities.
Despite departmental instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Although in the APHP, it is preferred to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of 4 November, firefighters who were in charge of approximately one quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency crossings of the Hotel-Dieu will all have received orders to take 30 serious cases per day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This November 4 date also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At Hotel-Dieu, emergency inmates will leave place on Monday to five general medical interns.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th", ensures without delay Loïc Capron, the president of the medical establishment commission (CME) of the APH, which supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," said Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in emergency," he said, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on-site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on the spot, he also ensures.
But it is up to the ARS to decide to close the emergency reception service.
"Things take place gradually," answered Nicolas Péju, spokesperson for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or he was lied to," laments the urgentist doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Released from his post as Head of the SMUR in early July for leading the leaf against the reorganization project, he is defined as a "warmer" in the face of a "cynic" decision made by "medical-administrative technology".
"They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly fattened.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting in Lariboisière's emergencies.
In the ARS, it is argued that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will have been strengthened.
In the ARS as well as in the APH, the "new hospital model" that has been on the way since October 7 is being defended, which is expected to continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general physicians should also be involved in the establishment of a "permanence of outpatient care".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnosing", asks Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of non-serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen like for level 3 maternity wards.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change our arms, including Christophe Prudhomme, Emergency Physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and will consider presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, UMP advisor in Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, he made it clear that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if they were returned to responsibility".
Anne Hidalgo, candidate PS, has again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had acted in favour of a moratorium so that there is no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would make a clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the bottom, we cannot admit it without an acceptable map of deferral to the other hospitals.
Obama ends listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama commanded the National Security Agency (NSA) to end its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, indicates an American head on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume its hand in the NSA hearing case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank supervision has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
When asked about this, a US administration official replied: "The United States does not carry out electronic surveillance aimed at headquarters of the World Bank and IMF in Washington."
Expressing himself under the seal of anonymity, this person did not specify whether such supervision had been established in the past.
Another official told him that Barack Obama had ordered to stop these practices over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one that brought an end to the ears of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes on Thursday but allowed them to continue.
The Commission has introduced new data restrictions that intelligence agencies are authorized to collect and have imposed a five-year limit for the retention of such information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations will now work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began on the eve of Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to "surpass national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security-related concern in Mozambique grows at the same time as conflicts flare up between powerful figures
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, tossing them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public event.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment company.
Concerned about her country's future, she exchanged her work clothes against a t-shirt with the words "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd in place of the Independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-headed Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 million in investment in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko in the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo mutually reject the responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is the cause of recent clashes and has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of Renamo on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when the government forces attacked the bases of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesperson of Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and accuses him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP, the French press agency on Wednesday, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "lost" who wanted to use "all the forces that he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have not been able to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open university and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know well how to negotiate and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of the votes collected by Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to obtain a greater number of votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but she has carried out disturbing flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked whether Renamo would reiterate that threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
"People think that those responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is the latter who find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestant, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "lifestyle models," says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that "the brutal force does not weigh in the face of the subtle russian," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland recommended a "mint selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it great that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have been in favour of this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "openly didactic" makes children "completely succeed", the messages being "submitted" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult writer for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or finished well, but there is an inborn sense of good and evil.
And it must be underlined; revealed through a history rather than declared.
The known basis for what we show and what we don't say.
A Hamas-armed fighter was killed tonight and another was injured by an Israeli tank shot in the Gaza Strip, learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists carried out a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian and Israel when they fired an Israeli armoured shell.
NSA espionage: the United States is "too far away", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the field of espionage, recognized Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the mass collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies, this is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the intercession by the NSA for communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant it to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this will no longer happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London to which he has been participating since Washington on Thursday, October 31 by video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified the information and information-gathering practices through the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since played many attacks through the interception of communications and information collection.
"We have in fact prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects," the US diplomat argued.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far in an inappropriate way," the Secretary of State admitted, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal on a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
On Thursday evening he assured President Obama that he was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would feel wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to rage this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program called "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by Internet giants.
Some 181 million items had been collected during the only month of January - from metadata on e-mails, text or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain, or Italy have revealed that the NSA had massively intercepted data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. President was not aware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the ball to the European intelligence services that had been seized of these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and that would not mean Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread in Asia on Friday.
Indonesia called on the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also led to China's leadership.
The Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master's asset, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League 1 club in a communiqué.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco in contrast to goals, broadcasted the list of players selected for this 12th day match, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The communiqué simply states that it is "broken", without specifying the nature of the wound.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee during his return of selection at the beginning of months.
A ceremony in memory of the Cremated Dead
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 o'clock, a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased creamized in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, will be attending and will explain, at a press conference, his funeral proposals.
To follow the ceremony, click on it above.
For their own obsessors, more and more French choose cremation, rather than inhumation: 53%, according to a study Ipsos conducted on 6 and 7 September with 109 people, instead of 47%.
For a neighbor's obsessors, it's the opposite: the French preferred the inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have trouble losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book La Mort en ashres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee of Funerary Ethics, he insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes, for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the loved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "will accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which is due to the "effacement of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is accepted without penalty in some Nordic and Protestant countries, still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Thanatology Society and author of the book Apprive the death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to appreciate it.
To appreciate the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as the one to which he would have been entitled with an inhumation.
Ipsos' annual survey showed a strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, to be religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of those who have chosen cremation want to hold a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums adapted to this evolution of society.
"For ten years, they have been trying to avoid violence in families from waiting, without doing anything, for one and a half hours, immediately followed by the restoration of ashes," said Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer teachers of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to appoint the deceased, to connect it to others, to invoke it, to give meaning to its death, to organize the farewell.
This has been the case with Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that Father Lachaise's crematorium has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of the memory, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of the people who have been crematized in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is transmitted online, to the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium allowed us to relax.
In The Seyne, the rat relocation turns to the polemic
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
Faced with the urgency of the situation, the Director of the Southern Habitat Lands Office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, that the couple and their three children be accommodated in a new T4.
Yet, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
Rats, there's always been in the cities.
The deratization undertaking carries out two passages a year, and in addition, we take action at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have had 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats don't pulverize in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, a dog will not be killed.
"We didn't invite the rats into our house," defends the family father who left his accommodation to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the envelope and are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has come down Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the decline of the dollar in the face of the yen, which is detrimental to the exporting values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony dropped from more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house where the flame takes place in the Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday afternoon in the Old Quebec was soon mastered.
Over thirty firefighters were deployed on the 9th of Hébert Street.
The flames appeared in a house of three houses spread over four floors behind the courtyard of the Quebec Seminary.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the firefighters arrived, which was many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw smoke.
"Then the alarms succeeded, because it was taking a boost to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, the spokesman for the firefighters of Quebec.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman : Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of the master of ceremony at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public about the tone of conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it has been resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of the poster heads emerged in Caroline, and have had a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We have created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", an evening of comedy and music for the benefit of the veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, to which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has taken on the scale, just like the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival went through non-traditional circuits, for example presenting shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a wired channel ("The League" on the theme of the fantasy football joyously lascif of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate took part in the program "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the casting of the series "Parks and Recreation", but is still more known for her series of viral videos " Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a unique voice (the surrealist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land program called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place at the Hotel de Ville in central Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in Larry's comic DNA for all of his work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would come down a alley between two buildings and say, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come down here.
Oil prices continue to decline and close to $96 barrel
The price of oil continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks compensated for a report showing that the Chinese electricity manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The US reference gross price for delivery in December dropped from 14 cents to 96.24 dollars the barrel at the end of the morning in Europe in electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by over 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to grow again after growth increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decrease that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Gross Brent, a reference for the international crude already used by U.S. refineries, has lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Termination of the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal re-established certain restrictions on the right of voluntary interruption of pregnancy that had been blocked by a court judge this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and widely challenging the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The decision by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice IVGs will have to have "privileged admission" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his or her status as a hospital-career, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre to issue a diagnosis or treatment.
IMG advocates argue that the content of the law may lead to an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, almost 22,000 women would be deprived of access to such institutions.
On Monday, a court of first instance had held on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who brawled the governor's post, asked the court to cancel the trial of the first instance that blocked the enforcement of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a return to force, on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% on the hearing side.
But was the show at the meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates appeared at the hearings of this 10th season, to confront the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the perch André Manukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of rediscovering their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so disappointed?
No candidate seems to have actually scored during this first award.
Like every year, the first audition shows boost a wide selection of weed singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want performance, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few found their account there.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind television screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make fun of it.
The Court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and search policy
A Federal Court of Appeal blocked a judge's decision on Thursday requiring changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed it from the file.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the call filed by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city has made use of its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and its associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed because it violated the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews given to the media and public statements in which it publicly reacted to the criticisms of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by falsely targeting black men and of Hispanic origin as part of their control and search program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and it has ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras carried on the body in the neighbourhoods where the largest number of controls are carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of preserving the names and addresses of persons who were rejected after police control.
The city's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in a certain form, but the number of recorded controls has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black men and of Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a collective action.
partisans advocating changes in the NYPD control and search program say they will put an end to unfair practices, make it possible to have more effective and reliable police forces, and will be able to change the way police departments use politics.
Opposers say that these changes would undermine the police's morale without reducing crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police officers had been severely reduced in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the constitutional practices of control and search, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD carried out its controls.
Renters must go to vote, as each of them averages $100 a month on the housing price that goes to the City tax.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
As we proceed to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to make things change in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us fireworks at $100,000, land from $4 million to $5 million in case...
Let's vote, that's the best way to express ourselves and say that's enough.
End of service for the Chef Cooker of the Elysée
Entering into the 500 m2 of the Swiss kitchens as a commission after working in embassies, the cook has severed all the steps until he became chief, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and feeding an incalculable number of greats of this world in a quasi-anonymous that he breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years.
The man with open face, scratched skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I went from one castle to another!", irony Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has appointed, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It's always the head of the state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mme Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," as she had forbidden women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
It does not move to the heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to terrestrial foods, "they are all gourmets", denounces Bernard Vaussion kindly.
Jacques Chirac had certainly "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "someone likes to eat" and "there's nothing much he doesn't like."
The current Head of State, who returned the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, has "no specific request for regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the State dinners in Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there are mistakes.
The former chef of the kitchens of the Elysée, who took a drink on Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, left with a pinch in the heart."François Hollande came to greet me".
He said hi.
"I'm a human side came up," he says.
The Chief will be replaced by his Deputy Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been in Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the fires in the Old Quebec on Friday afternoon.
The building of four houses, located on 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three alarms to the fire service.
The fire came forward, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of fires to adjacent buildings, a challenge of size for this area of the city where buildings are built closely.
The house was housed in four houses, but no tenant was in the area at the time of the fire.
The damage was all limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin of the investigation, but the sagers have removed the thesis from a criminal act.
Le Loup de Wall Street: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese escapes some images of his next film, whose role-title, that of an ambitious New York broker, is incarnated by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will take you off in his role as a degent trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "courtier in Long Island Stock Exchange, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast corruption case on Wall Street".
In the 80's, Jordan Belfort then climbed a cliff that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the vertiginous fall that will follow.
Without limits, man chaines parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the principal words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had joined them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long installation.
It looks like the film lasts at 2:45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in the race at the oscars.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "phone piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a canon pipe on a link involving the Minister of the Interior then in practice, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated to the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "beautiful special adviser".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack the Pawlby voice box and "plant constantly in front of his door", but Coulson also called it and left him voice messages.
"The charge suggests that Mr.Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the people's house hoping to surprise them, is the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three ways to investigate topics: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say "Of course we do."
The rumors about a liaison involving Clarke were first taken by the NotW editor's office when a source, testing a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that he had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
One band, on which voice messages were recorded hacked on his phone on at least three occasions, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the computer of the private detective that concerned Miss Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Miss Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls, asking for information about her, added Mr Edis.
Meanwhile, former Chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the surveillance of Miss Pawlby's minor actions and actions.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as other important men, such as the former Minister of Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr.Blunkett about a connection with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defense Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks have not conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Molcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to doing telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of violence
The President of the United States was to receive the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking US assistance to combat the greatest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq experienced its most deadly month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday, 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations has an even higher balance sheet of 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
Such violence is increasingly deadly despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the U.S. troops were withdrawn, the level of violence made a new slaughter fear while neighbouring Syria was in danger of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men have been shot in the streets or even at home, and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and of being the target of unjust arrests, has favored this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, after the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence was inflicted on the Islamic State in Iraq and on the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (sunites extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of talks in the United States by Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the U.S. President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since her arrival on Wednesday in Washington, Nuri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the elected members of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, who attributed to him the partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectary and authoritarian politics".
They also demanded Barack Obama to make Nuri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses a Uighor group of Tiananmen's attack
The Chinese Homeland Security Chief accused a group of Xinjiang Uighurs separatists on Friday of being behind the attack on the car trapped that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in downtown Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, drowned on the crowd that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital, symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and took fire killing its three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of eastern Turkestan as the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighors, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that are fuelled by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organized and premedified," Meng told the Hong Kongese Phoenix TV channel.
"The group that was behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of the East Turkestan," he added, saying, having been taken up by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was of oyster origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican investigates contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major worldwide survey of how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and couples of the same sex.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the ties of marriage.
The survey was sent to each National Bishops' Conference in mid-October, with the aim of obtaining as many responses as possible.
The information will serve to an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how to sound the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the Internet survey by asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: The Army attacks the last fief of the rebels
The irreducibles of the M23, some hundreds of fighters, were cut to nearly 2000 metres high on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jumba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"This has not ceased since this morning, the fights continue despite the night," said the AFP a Jumba resident, joined by telephone around 12.30, and according to which a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has diminished somewhat," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels a little away."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "went through the night" in Jumba before going up to the front for a "ratification operation".
It was very clearly heard behind it of small arms-fed cracks.
From Bunagana, a political fief and last strong place of rebellion that fell on Wednesday, a PSA journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the Stabilisation of the DRC, the battles entered "in a final phase", the FARDCs "entered the residual M23 positions to release them".
Since the resumption of Friday, clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fights, but it provides government troops with strong support for intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well equipped in munitions, were on their way to the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, border crossing with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand-new FARDC truck, to ensure the rise of another device flying the M23 positions on the hills.
The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, again called on Wednesday evening the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" in the process of disarming "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December with no results at the moment.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, only at Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
The M23 was born of a mutiny in April 2012, of former rebels, essentially Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which rejects Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its basement boasts coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where some 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the movement of return to the DRC that had been set in motion in the morning turned to mid-day.
"This morning we crossed into our fields, but the soldiers told us to repel us," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including a babysitter on his back.
It seems that fire blows are approaching populations.
Early in the evening, dozens of inhabitants crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this beast of scene
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the productions sung and danced take their turn.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical affirms itself as a genre of success.
Long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts would stop in the ridicule.
And the successes like Cabaret or the Miserables carried the aureole of the mystery.
Jean-Luc Choplin's arrival at Chatelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes handle titles as successful tubes.
The first resume, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" could well be one of the success of the season.
In other scenes, musical performances such as "1789", "the Bastille lovers" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comedies musicales" and lecturer at Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard conquered.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First, there are the "musical shows" that evolve in favour of producers...
Some use beautiful pictures and a true history as in 1789, the lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year back bond on the pretext that we can serve almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in the head of the poster.
Afterwards, we have musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of Châtelet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularises Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
The independent French producers are attempting a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of Spider Woman" or "L'Éveil du Spring" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these jobs in many schools.
Jobs are many of the regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The living of talent is as important as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of the culture in France.
There are few plays that go on tour and are often from boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of a lust for these girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are often held by professionals who answer the questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
The mayonnaise is mounted in Paris and disgusted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning about 5:30 a.m., on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is free of charge.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 9:00, at the location of the accident, when the road was cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not lead to bottlenecks, as the accident took place at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this output/entry of the ring.
A child severely injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was severely injured following an attack on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
Its vital prognosis is no longer committed, but it is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed to new order.
DRC: The Army Prepares a New Assault
Children play on a carbonized shield that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new assault on the last bastions of the rebels of the M23 near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The objective is to unravel the M23 of the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from itself.
It will remain only the hill of Runyonyi.
"This Chanzu isn't very strategic," said North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku to the AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last strong place of rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23 have been recanted to nearly 2,000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jumba
In Jumba, a resident who had reported fighting all around Thursday throughout the day said that the situation was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the previous fights and were buried.
One girl was shot and three others were wounded, including a severe one, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the PSA.
Since the resumption of FARDC and the rebels' struggles on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no record of the loss of human life.
NSA's revelations increase business paranoia with respect to State surveillance
For a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Frankfurt Consulate, the capital of Germany.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American front-post, less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of hearing aids and that the transaction sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of US intelligence services, once again insisted in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "store the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant became a denouncing consultant, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know if the director should believe in words.
Reports say that the American National Security Agency has spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by U.S. suppliers of storage services in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever caused the paranoia of companies with regard to State surveillance.
The revelation that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vessel to overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are probably also potential targets.
Snowden made the collaboration between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States is as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the EY consulting firm.
However, in all of Mr Snowden's documents, there is no indication that the United States has so far transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A Member of the German Parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company of company software, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn't have let her die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, through farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the extent and sophistication of American spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations have been a shock to some companies that thought until then that China represented the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that the data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a Cloud Security Alliance survey, a professional organization, some 10% of non-American members have renounced their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after disclosures on the US Prism Data Exploration Program.
Jim Snabe, SAP co-director, says: "Our clients are asking us today a question that they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you guarantee that they will stay physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already know, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
"It has been a recurring subject for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical-producing company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business leaders are generally not inclined to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, if that would leave the benefit to an opponent.
Large companies have long battled the message that it is at least imprudent to recover a free USB key in a professional salon or leave a laptop without supervision in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi car manufacturer, says that the collection of mobile phones prior to council meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid on their travel abroad due to the risk of attaining the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access," warned BfV in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The United States' National Estimate of Intelligence (NIE) in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to a second degree of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former French Internal Intelligence Director, the DCRI, said this month in an interview: "Services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
Parents of a Georgian teenager, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgian teenager, whose body was found in a treadmill in the gymnasium of his high school, believe that his son was murdered, said the lawyer of the family Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11 in a tapestry standing behind the gymnasium steps of his high school.
The investigators of the sheriff of the County of Lowndes concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family contests these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer from Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think that this challenges all logic, the laws of physics and the common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered solely for the purpose of covering the persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their sons to school with a poster and they were given it in a mortar bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider there to be a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from "positional asphyxia".
However, one second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates elements to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to deliver all video surveillance records that the investigators had examined.
Teenager parents said they expected video images to contain clues about the circumstances of her death.
CDC publishes child allergy advice for schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has published a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the US government publishes, as the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies has greatly climbed.
A child in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize the teaching body and the staff to food allergies in the child, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the epiPen self-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of States have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something hits my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have pickles on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which, on one hand, publicly engages the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when the Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks after the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence on the one hand and a condemnation of the hearings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't it be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil over the analysis by American diplomacy of political and other issues worldwide, we consider that, in view of the American power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe U.S. systems of interpretation against French diplomacy in the United States, this is in no way an indication of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information from the NSA about terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we look at American collaboration?
For the last ten years, the establishment of very powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States in particular have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and which are described on both sides as essential.
As an example, Mohammed Merah's presence in tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French by means of the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services, and, in return - it has already been said - the Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the substantive question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to acquire interception tools, that the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and ultimately the issue of infringements of freedoms.
What are the real risks of the United States? a deterioration of their image?
I don't see how they can be punished.
The American risk can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have slowed down.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are searching, in the light of revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. suppliers subject to US legislation, and therefore to the NSA's share.
Last element: the vast movement of revelations committed by the media from around the world, which helps to engage in a debate on the practices of intelligence monitoring until they are almost non-existent, could motivate legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Intersex parents can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of the newborns will no longer be attributed, strictly, to the birth.
As part of the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child's sex, allowing them to register "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make precipitated decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their babies, and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
According to BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, concussioned and squirted.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexed, intersexity being part of the group of sixty-nine diagnostic diseases as disorders of sexual development, a generic term that designates persons possessing atypical chromosomes or gonades (or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersected.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sexual identification specialist, said the new German law "seemed to be a good idea."
Intersex children have ethical dilemmas.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case of most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very specific.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery around homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively that of a man or exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as being one or the other.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sex, (such as muscle mass, hairfulness, chest and stature), primary sex (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes caused by prejudice.
Young boys of non-conformity now have camps that are specially intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial that allows her to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from this land of Catholic territory signed a petition for the "gender theory" to be removed from school books.
The American site Catholic Online also opposed the German law, writing that "because the world is drawn into a new reign where the genre is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overturned."
In Maryland, the mother of a baby also said about Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at their birth.
"The role of parent is quite stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And only a dozen years ago, the medical community considered the type as an aridian, which can be erased and on which one can be redesigned.
But now, many people challenge the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that doctors can sometimes cheat, not knowing how a child will feel about sexual reassignment when he grows up.
"In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, they weren't called the psychiatrist, they were calling the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr. John Money, Johns-Hopkins University, who considered that gender is malleable.
He dedicated the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as John/John, his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a broken circumcision to make him completely castrate, also removing the testicles, and raising him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he returned to a boy and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors "always repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations said "they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
The doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
When he was 18, he suffered a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something wasn't going, he asked for his medical records.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DSD) that prevented his body from producing sufficient testosterone so that his sex organs could develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment, and took his breasts off.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex persons.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director-general of the non-profit organization based in California Lawyers for Reported Choice, fears that the German law "invites to labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an "indeterminate" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only move forward with assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex name."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal type," she added.
The German law concerns the allocation of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should carry out at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist who specializes in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law will "responsive" parents and children.
Dr Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and internal in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or harbouring mothers.
"The law leaves a certain latitude to parents so they do not have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time to register "male" or "female".
So everything is fine – you can raise your child and love it.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for an irreversible surgery.
"It puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what is right," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and this is something wonderful.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that his government will hold until 2015, despite the strong tensions between the left and the right in the ruling coalition, when approaching the Senate's vote to unravel Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the left-central leader said he had "firmly intent" to continue to rule with his coalition until the next legislative election of 2015.
The High Chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet within the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council condemned for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where it counts more opponents than supporters, declares his dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2nd, his refusal to give injunctions of Berlusconi that already wanted the cabinet to be dropped.
L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transport Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fires.
Firefighters called at the scene of the drama claimed to have responded to a call of "injured multiples".
"The forces of the order are on the spot," the airport says on its Twitter account, while the images of televisions show people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a gunfire," said a spokesman for the U.S. Transport Security Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a bench, and a second person transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9.30 locals (12.30 a.m. in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
Los Angeles Times states that the 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport were suspended.
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli tanks shots killed a Hamas-Islamic Palestinian militant Thursday and severely injured another one in the south of the Gaza Strip, learned from sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in that region, because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Hebrew State, crossed the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama have, in the greatest secret, planned to replace Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most remarkable event in the very expected 2012 book of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday evening that the president's close collaborators had carried out "in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's avoidance could help Obama for his re-election while his hopes were wagging.
According to the policy correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the senior officials of the campaign and the White House, namely the former Secretary-General of the House-Blanche Bill Daley, to measure the effect of replacing the Vice-President with the former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been kept in Chicago's campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisors from the president – including Daley, the former campaign leader of Obama Jim Messina and the former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Pluffe – knew that the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley carried the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally deciding against change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "do not significantly improve Obama's chances of success".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them," Daley said in the paper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so it was said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified the "co-op" examination, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested much to find out if the change would be beneficial in the polling.
"The campaigns do not spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, we do not know whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of the possible renovation.
Although Daley said he did not think that the president "was aware" of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that he was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not permanently answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know that Biden's evacuation of the presidential list was being examined.
"Perhaps," said Martin.
Do you want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the Medus-based world.
Charlie Francis drew on the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a light snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on the jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more it is licked, the more brilliant it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said, "It's something incredible but we're still only at the beginnings in terms of production, and 2 g of it costs about £200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the neutral pH language.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because the luminescence of jellyfish is worth four times as much as gold.
So each ball costs me about £ 140.
But she tastes pretty good!
The company with Charlie's experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added, "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
The ice uses fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while practicing tai chi, revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and destined for the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st Tai Chi movement, with his hands as a musician who broke the air," says Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband the week before her death to take her out of the hospital and take her to their Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even if we are citizens, it is our spiritual house.
"He was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living he had," she added.
Lou Reed had a liver graft in May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candies, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pedre.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed a single candy and I'm certainly not going to do it again this year.
But the states show that I'm the Welsh sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 million in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is the trends.
The disguises are expected to represent $1.2 million out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men in the Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with staying traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, the Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal disguises this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, it's not garnished.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9 million in candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kilograms of Hershey bars, sucettes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great news for the 41 million kids who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, we're not telling stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Maize candy is the only thing we don't want to eat; yet nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Manufacturers Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't come to clarify yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted homes in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to the America Haunts, and this includes these amazing pictures of you pissing on that your friends put on Facebook and you can't remove and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the style "beautiful head".
Finally, let's talk about citrols.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped citrol, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – that's something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby-citrol" trend only began last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these potions and had no to sit in.
This year, the Americans will spend about 106 million dollars in citrus fruits, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The windshields that flourish gently on the porch of your house were probably coming from Illinois, where 542 million citrus fruits were grown this year.
If you're looking to make more remark, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg tank.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bankruptcy structure (bad bank) comprising 38 billion books (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its recurrence.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of the questionable assets in its balance sheet in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned up the balance sheet within three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for depreciation of additional doubtful claims from four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thereby strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would be able to draw a line over the past, the government in particular being accused of taking part in the management of RBS.
"We can now go ahead, worry about the future and about 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the United Kingdom," said the new Director General Ross McEwan in the press.
Land Rover announces his sponsorship of a series of rallyers
The interior has six-point headrests and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
The options include improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director General of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rallyers who join Bowler have changed."
Not all are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are very happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try to different forms of rally in the United Kingdom and the international, and to prepare for the rigours and the realities of the raid rallies.
We have had a lot of fun to develop the vehicle of the Defender Challenge – the championship will really be exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North and Middle East Africa.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost dog after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornic in a career
Ruby, a cocker spaghetti, had escaped after a road accident without gravity
She was identified three days later by a person who was walking her dog stuck in the career
Firemen came down in memory along the cliff to recover the dog and save it from a certain death.
A dog had the chance to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to recover it safely while it was because it was 15 m above the ground on the unstable saloon of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month cocker spaghetti, escaped after an accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a Wednesday career.
His owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked West Yorkshire's Fire and Relief Service.
They desperately sought their lost dog and appealed to social media sites after she disappeared in the career as a result of an accident without gravity.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with a sharp view who was walking his dog spotted Ruby on a corniche in the career, stuck at 15 m above the floor.
A technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton firehouse crashed on the site and went down in recall to save Ruby using an animal feeder to carry her up to the cliff.
Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing someone noticed the dog.
Technical Relief Officer Peter Lau said, "Ruby has been very lucky to get out of it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was conducted in the veterinarian for a check-up; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified by observing relief."
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was surprising to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and she had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were brave.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely formidable.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid she would fall, but she didn't move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never had Katy Perry with him when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a cheerleader on Jagger's "Old Habitats Die Hard" song in 2004.
Perry said she had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "he drenched me when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very nice."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he "responsibly denied having made progress in Katy Perry."
The representative added, "Perhaps she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed in the first place of the charters this week.
Beijing Faces a Turkmen Islamic Movement
"The backstage support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkestan based in Central and Western Asia," said the patron of Chinese security organs to a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, who was a member of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), was speaking in Tashkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after the Monday attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Ouighurs of the same family in the Xinjiang Muslim-dominant region, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with petrol cans against the entry of the forbidden City to Beijing, in a suicide attack that caused two deaths and 40 injuries.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to fight for the independence of East Turkestan, former Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated to Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives the Scottish choice
Another day, another disturbing history of independence.
This time, we are expected to have an independent Scotland to join the European Free Trade Area in order to join the EU.
And that's what we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along Hadrian's wall.
While it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not in the headlines (and that was to be expected).
Neither has anyone said that the EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a minor concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from Scotland.
So it's a story that's not a story.
And a story so old that she is now fixed: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" over 40 years ago.
However, one has forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why trade the London yoke against that of Brussels, in particular now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at the point of death.
With the crisis of the euro, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties opposing the EU or militating for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency gain ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptive Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and emerged from the Democratic Liberal Party (equivalent to our Liberals-Democrats) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the heavy carcan on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the national governments that are having excessive budgetary deficits – that was true only for Greece.
Rather, the European system has made it difficult for German exporters to maintain their exchange rates – what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of national currency, the countries of southern Europe encounter an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper burden on productivity in Europe.
Following the 'green' energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subsidizing French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-effective drawback, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All world wage freezes will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, the revolt rages, particularly in France, one of the EU's major drivers.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy in a bad way.
As a result: Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the Anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, bringing the socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the suffrage – a timely warning for the British Labour Party which reminds it that it cannot start from the principle that a split on the right will automatically promote the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use the next year's European elections to create a single anti-Money bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are a good figure in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and single anti-monnaie feeling in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will be more like the free "Europe of Nations (Sovereign)" favored by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope it will make the United States a soft eye.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a small England region (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could agree with a more free European agreement, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and it is worth noting – the anti-austerity political movement that has been most successful in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts (and implementation) proposed by the Chancellor of the Labour Equiquiquire, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative/Liberal-Democrat coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Ageing Earlier
Studies show that Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
CNN's former correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's breasts and pup hair start growing at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time trying to reassure parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid development towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as the burgeoning of the breasts, the hairs under the arms and in the pubic area and the body smells, appear earlier among the girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, when it was 12 years three-quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "earlier" when the development of the chest is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster development may justify testing by an endocrinologist to remove serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but recognizes that "the control of puberty can mitigate certain behavioural problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at the age of 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about rules, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came back from school scared and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages transmitted by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls aged 6 to 9 that linked the percentage of fat mass to the release of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the younger pubial area, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as among girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and infants.
"We must be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrician working in the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatricians for advice on how to talk to their children.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose early puberty needs to be reassured that, even when it happens sooner than planned, the process is part of life.
The homage to the folk of the brothers Coen
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by Brother Coen, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that began just to resonate before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography had just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinematèque, had added the Palm of Gold in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the Peter trio, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their return on the American film star, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the pop planet star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs played live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a jubilation contagious.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich contours of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less shiny clothes, a sweet voice when she sings, but the jury due to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about one week the troubles of a folk singer who can't go through and get angry with the whole earth.
He accepts back foot replacements up in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success was tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of malchance, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a career, but integrated, with self-destructive behaviour," said the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two folk music fans built their story on real personalities of the time like the folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the arrival of Greenwich village, this New York district called to become "the epicenter of the development of folk music that would generate international stars" as author Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk wrote.
The film then takes documentary allures, from the label of dusty music invaded by 33T invendus inhabited by an impassable old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafés where the singers were.
Brother Coen's magic still works by integrating a funny character that crosses the film constantly: a magnificent red cat with a cracking eye, a fortune-stricken companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled "great in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered as good", "a chance can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in everything that can stop us from expressing."
Gérard de Villiers, author of "SAS", died.
He'll never have known the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times dedicated him to "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, a theatre of 198 and 199 opposed to the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he moved on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he also went to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Probably between 120 and 150 million all countries confused," he advanced last March.
His Burmese cat on the knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of a building of the Foch Avenue at two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he mentioned some of the languages in which SAS adventures have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirated editions", he added, drawing a stack of books on the low table between bronzes or reported ivorys from the 130 countries of the Alps to situate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman to the advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his very serene height (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, aristocrat of the U.S.A. and contract agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, throws himself to the kits of all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 1970s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never meant to be a literary author," Gérard de Villiers explained.
I consider myself to be a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, Albert London, who went on site and came back with real and long investigations."
The father of SAS said "make a kind of geopolitical slipton."
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of the PSA, diplomats, and people of the services I have known for some twenty or thirty years.
Suddenly, many of his SAS are often pre-monitored: so, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime having killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret command center of the CIA in this city, cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egypt's Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Plot of Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on the Malian capital.
I am not guessing, Mr Gérard de Villiers was defending himself, I am simply making assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his marguerite IBM writing machine, dating back to 1976, "of which all the pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photographs of the author with African warlords are attached to the walls of his office.
Regularly pushed for machismo by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers left the charges behind in two sentences.
Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am still very welcome in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He will not die and not retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes are complaining about the width of seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute rages between the large aeronautical builders about the width of the tourist class's seats on long-distance flights, opening the way to bitter confrontation during the Dubai air show which takes place this month.
The conflict concerns the width of the proposed seats on long-run flights to passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most shortest by airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautical industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing states that this should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the aircraft sought to sell even larger versions of their long-run bimotor aircraft, possibly waiting for a record of orders during the event from November 17 to 21.
The way in which seats will be positioned at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-junmbo segment.
Boeing states that its revised "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats of more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people into 18-inch seats in rows of 9.
Aeronautic giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai air show, where 777X should take a step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were able to see recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financials of a picture showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing offers long-distance flights in tighter seats than in regional turbo-propeller planes," said John Leahy, Airbus' commercial director.
As food habits change, people grow, but seats in planes have not radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 set out the modern long-distance journey, and the turn of the century, the average American weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The mid-first-century American size tower is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival adheres to a concept of seat that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly baptized jet set was narrower.
Airbus adds that it ordered a study indicating that an additional inch at the seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures with regard to the size of seats and asserts that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study showed that the cabin experience did not depend only on the width of seats.
"It's really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do in order to get their activities done," said Kent Craver, in charge of the passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute there is a race with aircraft orders for at least $700 million at market prices in the coming decades, enough to weigh the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a yield per seat in their latest models of long-rail bimotors 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 original model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this to be able to rent more seats and make its planes more competitive by reporting to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines have to choose.
The aircraft vendors who tour the world even take one metre with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable devices, all manufacturers also offer low-cost aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering larger seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only other major large modern equipment manufacturer, experts say that it is unlikely that its call to the aeronautical industry to set up a standard of size for the seats will succeed, but that it could cause the sales wave to be forgotten by 777X.
Oracle shareholders irritated by ELLISON's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on Thursday against the compensation proposal for the founder and Director General Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but comes to tarnish the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just ventured from the victory of his ship at the Cup of America.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had received a negative vote on his pay.
The Oracle boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but earned approximately $77 million from stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire 2013 fiscal year, the profit of Oracle has increased by 3.5%, while the course of the scholarship was 27.5%, overperforming the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotin vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Other tests are required before testing the human being, but Professor Ronald Crystal of New York's Weill Cornell Medical College said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies trace all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from having a dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the mice vaccinated that were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated "were paralyzed," said the researchers, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
Experiences are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective as they contained antibodies.
Injections were to be repeated so often so that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies plants.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addition to nicotine.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will take no pleasure in the anti-nicotin vaccine, and that will help them to lose their bad habits," he added.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but reported that much more extensive research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by a drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement affirmed this time that he had lost his life in this strike, which was carried out in the North-Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
The day before, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistan Taliban movement.
Tripodi does not have to be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
The former South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three assets located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to see whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several ministers of the State to renew its leases in Circular Quay, where Obeids owned two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiration in August 2005, without any tenders.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Assistant Secretary-General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the government pressured the leases to be the subject of an invitation to tender.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for the companies of Circular Quay, which related to the Obeids approximately $2.5 million per year, were renewed without any tendering.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who recognized Mr. Tripodi as demanding a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the CICA showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but in any case, that wasn't it.
In any case, certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, says one responsible
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday evening, confirming a military officer in Fox News.
The manager did not specify the target, but said there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The government is currently exploring the possibility of setting up a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending the measures of repression.
The test, if adopted, would be applied in accordance with a criterion to prevent visas 457 from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a means of diversion to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A Government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government discourse on foreign workers, saying that it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The failed statements on "foreigners returning to the end of the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are a disgraceful return at the time the unions were demanding a protected labour market," she said to Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The working paper reports on the 12 measures previously envisaged by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to find out "if the job offer is genuine in the case the applicant is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or the person concerned in the sponsoring company".
Businesses could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually employed hundreds of them.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would be killed by a heart attack after arriving on a ship carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The grown-up son of a man, aged 9, went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father died on Wednesday to an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Baron Transport Minister Kramer said the project "would bring together the United Kingdom".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will be on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of construction of the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 to £42.6.
The British Government, which talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh from three hours or more.
Baron Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it has are enormous.
Without him, we are faced with a problem of the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support "equivocally" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall project of high-speed rail network across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to examine options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British Ministers next year and then we will decide together the next steps."
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain for now in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the US gesture to facilitate regulation on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers may already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers examine the decision that obliges American carriers to do important work in order to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is the subject of a regulation requiring aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety permanently and passengers to comply with safety instructions provided by crew members.
Virgin, who had already told CASA of her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (from the Wi-Fi technology-based entertainment system) on our planes," said a spokesman.
Qantas said she respected the current rules for the moment.
"According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in the regulatory developments that might benefit passengers, and we will be closely examining the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand luggage transport programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said the FAA.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stored under seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent fight
The small town of Pia has experienced unusual excess fever Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowding of about 30 people according to the testimony gathered...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a row involving several people broke out on the side of the Poste.
At least four slight injuries would be regretted.
Alarmed, the gendarmes went to the site to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s gage lenders take advantage of the medium-class constraints to tighten the belt
In one of Bendemeer's trading centre lenders in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga holds a bracelet, ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay her girls' tuition fees.
"My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money is gone inside," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in some parts of South-East Asia – where household debt increases – that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, became this week the third company on-line loans to be introduced to the Singapore stock exchange.
Placing jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it is almost as cheap as non-secured bank loans.
In general, Singapore-led lenders take an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same commercial centre.
However, bank lenders have the advantage of not asking for a solvency check or proof of salary, and can release loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to lenders on the street while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and over-indebtment of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and low-market credit fuelled by an overly lax monetary policy in the advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to stable lenders to bridge the gap while their economies are experiencing a slowdown.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the increasing debt of households, mainly due to the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest ratio of household debt/gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or lower [wage scale] are looking to supplement their incomes as they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have led people to rush their personal effects to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items in stock in the 200 city-state loan stores are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's get the chain of Grandmother gold and we'll go back and look for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest fan loan shop operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops over the past few months.
The increase is such in the banking sector that ValueMax, a shop operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops such as this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, his general director.
The company will finance them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week when it was introduced to the Singapore stock exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have identified criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates they do, Ms. Yeah says that the payout offers not only lower rates than the other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers mortgage property they already own, and moneyting their personal property does not increase household debt," she says.
Getting started is becoming more socially acceptable as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term.
Not only are people who go to the lenders' homes who have financial problems.
Singapore's wealthy people also go to ValueMax's loan stores to cast gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of society.
"It may be people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that need cash to make a difficult head," added Miss Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was inficiating, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a communiqué, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it should not contact people under the age of 18 and do not access the Internet.
He will compare it in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being expelled from it
A man dressed in a walled Nazi uniform of a brassard with the gammed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the facility that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to escape, but "the time she arrived, she had already left without slavery," she added.
I was making a tail when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
The people were blindfolded.
"You don't go out on the street unless you want to draw attention," said a client named Rosina Rusin, aged 60, at Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to dress in monsters, but it was difficult to know whether it was a canal.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS brassard twice a week at Asda for three years," said Paul Dutton, explaining to suffer from "mental problems".
$325 million life plan for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the wavering health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the government will not waste the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Pibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "emergency" measures to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The four-year funding was decided upon after consultations with the government's independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will solve the unique difficulties facing the state," said Pibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgeries.
Additional 2 600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up with the delay.
Funding is also provided for unscheduled clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health system," said Pibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain the current funding levels to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless they are followed by genuine reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the Government for responding to the urgent request for assistance from the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute greatly to removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-emergency procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
But the Spokesperson of the Health Opposition Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "a solution to fortune."
"The reason we are here is that the state's working government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the state that takes up almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth puts $300 million, and claims it's a tough day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Pibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstitution of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Going through France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent in a convent by her family.
When she rebelled, she faced the unbridled cruelty of a Deliberately Sad Mother and became an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never sees lubricity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscious solemnity of the story could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapon production capacity, states the monitoring body
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gases, said the International Chemical Weapons Surveillance Agency Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIC) arrived with a day in advance on the deadline of the
November 1 fixed by the organization based in The Hague ordering in Damascus to destroy or "make unnecessary" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable for the destruction of Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin neurotoxic agents.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the city of Safira which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Britain.
The militant group, following the evolution of the human balance sheet through a network of Syria-based militants, said Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad were killed, of whom 18,678 were fighters of the pro-government forces and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom are related to groups of the Al-Qaeda network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but it did not give any clarification.
The fights stressed the importance of the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors as they must complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that continues, within a limited period of time.
A statement by the OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied with having controlled – and seen destroyed – all critical production and machinery for mixing and filling".
She added that "no other inspection activity is currently planned."
Earlier in the week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether Safira's unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the Executive Committee of the OPCW.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of the Ahmet Uzumcu organization, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposed Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of el-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there had been a major explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence imposed against one of Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 reacted angrily to the plea against the last conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on flight as one of the most sought-after men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the bombings.
It could be released at the end of 15 years under parole.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass killing for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which resulted in the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of many other charges in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks targeting churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors have asked for a life imprisonment sentence, yet they could have asked that the man, described as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On board the tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"It should be dragged before the execution squad," said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without any other grandchildren, or see my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a parked van outside, exploded just after 23 hours on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze blew up a backpack with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He swam in the coma the next day of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he died three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the U.S. forces would kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Ousama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Ben Laden in order to re-establish links between South-East Asia and Al-Qaeda terrorist groups.
"He didn't go," said Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was mocking himself for the sorrow he could have caused to others.
The verdict was rendered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of cries this year," said Ms. Corteen.
However, Patek may appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but don't make a phone call)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronics to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phone – under the new highly anticipated guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and have updated the training manuals for crew members and the rules for aircraft storage to be in conformity.
FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," said the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them on before the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft at the descent of the aircraft before landing and do not turn them on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, said the FAA.
Most new line aircraft and other modified aircraft so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said he was happy about these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we are going to work closely with the carriers for it – it will benefit everyone," said Glading in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room attendants" when it comes to this question.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft in plane mode.
So still not Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was driven out loudly by an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be anchored because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, National Transport Safety Expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered to be at risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relays if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industrial advisory committee established by FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease the restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, claim that there is no valid safety reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off or deliberately turn off their devices.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 as a result of the reports on interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New line aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of online aircraft should allow a wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
eBook readers, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who pressure to ease the restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders loaded a line plane of readers of Kindle eBooks and made it fly to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee on mixed feelings about whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines said he thought interferences from devices were real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA authorize pilots to request passengers to turn off their aircraft during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them sensible arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A heliterated bird of a North Sea platform has been released in nature
A bird, helitruized after being found exhausted on a oil platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
The stream of water was mounted on a helicopter towards Aberdeen last month before it was set up by the Scottish SPCA in its rescue center of Alloa.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This water stream was probably a winter migrationr that came from northern Europe and was caught in the middle of violent North Sea winds."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added, "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water stream was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and define what wealth and jobs creators want to see in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the broadest and most complete investigation with British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, who are generally representative of all business sizes, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now seeking exportation outside Europe, focusing on countries that modernise and develop while the EU states are stagnant.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to become involved in the long and hard process of reforming the European institutional arenas.
When asked for their advice on specific political issues – ranging from regulating monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key skills should go back to Westminster's hands.
The single market has led to general discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40% of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European, are even in agreement.
Finally, and most of all, our investigation with business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue its initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based EU relationship rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the world of the company insists on a "significant change" that restores power in the United Kingdom.
The issues are high – reaching to change the Treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would allow 16% of the votes to be cast in favour of maintaining the country in the EU at a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt one moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is committed to closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain, and, as the findings of our survey show, it means once again focusing on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States with the colours of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed friandies to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, the Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the parties caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumes participated in the parade organized in the district of "Greenwich village".
Everyone is overexcited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to wear the costume I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy, add Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of Toussaint, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the Director of Gazprom.
"A historic event took place today: The construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, Director General of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream should allow the diversification of Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, the country by which most of the Russian gas is transferred to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional channels, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is implemented in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
Pitcairn Island wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced on Thursday the newspaper Les News de Tahiti, retaking information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Poland), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands close to it.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the bounty mutinies, an episode of the history of the British Navy, which resulted in three Hollywood adaptations.
Some tens of inhabitants, most of the descendants of the Mutinées of Bounty, still live Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2 that correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
An Assistant to the Mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuate these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port to place military supervisory ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive air and sea surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian ZEE, neighbouring Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese Deputy Governor
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin, north-east China, was sentenced to a life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having touched more than 19 million yuan of pot-wine, reports Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said Beijing's first intermediate court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intraitable with the powerful "tricks" as with the "flies" - the junior officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been condemned, including former Petrochina oil giant executives.
The recent most spectacular case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having sought the highest positions in the state.
However, the government has never expressed any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assaults following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA of New South Wales were accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing by the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was accused of child pornography offences and a physical education monitor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer-advisor to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second case.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by stressing that "external controls of the YMCA have been carried out and indicated that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst reviews on four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities held in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure to recruit Lord and failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings in children's safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with children, that he kept them in private, made them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was managed by Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, said she found the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqueu Barnat, responsible for "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director-General said that he rejected the testimony of staff that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their superior hierarchy.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord confused their judgment, which made them not report their actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views before the board of the YMCA of New South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson drawn from "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "the reporting" by staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have confidential arrangements signed to staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by the YMCA Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to prevent any contamination of evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on child sexual violence, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University in front of the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview the last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old man expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since its departure in June 2007, after a decade at the head of the country, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Special Envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to Prime Minister's position, Mr Blair would have responded, according to London's Standard Eventing: "Yes, of course, but it may happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian events met in Cardiff to confront and win the horse trophy of the year, they knew the competition would be rough.
But nobody expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet in school and only a few months after having made his first weapons, the little one and his Shetland Toffee pony trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparables – of the same size – were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestrian center, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side in a relaxed way to make his 2-year-old Toffee pony parade around the track.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for his unusual natural dressing qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and trained with his Shetland pony every day.
Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffee are doing a great duo."
They appeared to each other and to each other, but both of them increased the golden cut and rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the tracks of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging it and applauding it."
He went through the entire length of the running track and even if he seemed to be quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is mad with animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares for.
In the way he began, he will surely soon participate in the event of the Year's Horse – and I am sure he will make a good performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well present and how they paraded on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud of it.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be revised"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be revised, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to television that he had accepted wine pots to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express is going to undergo a "complete remediation," the regulator said.
The order of "removal" comes from Guangdon administration for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the company listed Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete renovation of New Express, and recommended that he conduct a survey of the people responsible for New Express and immediately restart the journal's management team."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a first-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published false stories against money.
"In this case, I have nuzzled Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
A number of important suspects recently made television adjectives.
Specialists say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to commit themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a hurry.
The radioactive steam leak detected on one of the two Charles-de-Gaulle nuclear boilers, in mid-October and while the boat was at sea, was "safe for the sailors", but it is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
On the other hand, DCNS, a defence naval specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, deployed in the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing boiler.
"All is implemented so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can carry out its planned deployment at the end of 2013," says DCNS.
And the National Navy to certify that "the ship's activity programme" is not at all at issue with nuclear propulsion.
Let us recall that the Charles de-Gaulle aircraft carrier leaves a six-month intermediate maintenance period.
He had appeared from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, is intended to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "little damage", circumscribed to the reactor's confinement space, had occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to find a deep dissatisfaction with the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, flood of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to no longer end.
In short, unlimited phoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be spared to allow a very respectful tax on those who pay.
Any money taken from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no difficulty in sumptuous spending and maintenance of boite ducks: deficit cultural centre, strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, whether they are sold to the private enterprise or demolished.
It is also difficult to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for tax payers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such enterprises, but rather in the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that lakes in the Fisheries and Pillars will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water-consumers) and the high population decline, water use has declined considerably throughout the territory.
Without saying waste, the city will never lack water and the strict regulation of its use could be very easy.
In short, it is easy to realize great things with money from others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for over 40 years by tie-ups with beautiful degrees for most, and I don't think a sheep raiser gets worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico having its own railway route
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4-foot tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they've ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on an equivalent length of nearly six long football plots, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to conceal drug-loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs got out of sight, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important crossing discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, thus challenging drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards with railways leaving the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and going up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British Police issue an extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuador Embassy in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "remission notice" against 40-year-old Australian, asking him to come to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be able to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated its appeal against extradition at the beginning of the month.
Believing that Stockholm authorized its transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuador Embassy in London on 19 June, calling for political asylum in South America.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asked him to come to a police station at the time and time of his choice," said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the conditions for his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the police's delivery of the notice.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after revealing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How biometry invaded our lives
Finish the password to tap to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric."
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a world as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
The organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this commitment to biometry, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 and France, the National Commission for Computer Science and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of prints, the form of the hand or the vinuous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and at any time," justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy in the CDT (Centre for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in each other, and pessimism in others?
Biometrics will be based on new technologies, which will enable new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and venous network of palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the field of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand involve a voluntary and specific gesture of the people.
It is both security - we cannot capture this data on their own - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
Consequently, research has been carried out for twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (colored part of the eye).
As a result of increased sensor accuracy and computer computing capacity required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, calculated Cyrille Bataller, director of the Accenture R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we do research on the recognition of voice or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," said Sridhar Iyangar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
Unique and infallible marker, DNA also arouses hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavenier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospectives at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC proposes to the judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples in the place of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (to ensure that the person is the person she claims to be).
The identification concerned so far the issue of identity papers: we must confront the biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) with the information that the state has on all the citizens already set.
This makes it possible to ensure that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
"We will recover the images of surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities who freely travel over the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, responsible for commercial development at NEC France for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take a picture of a guy who tails in a store, follow his progression through facial recognition and calculate waiting time.
Authentication initially involved physical access (frontier, protected premises, canteens...) or logic (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control was added.
"A biometric sharper avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend who points for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric player: this gesture replaces the secret code hit.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and major distribution teachers: at the time of paying in-store with its bank card, the client does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If successful, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Hints to Ensure Users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that she can make time.
"If, thanks to biometry, a client stays in cash for thirty seconds less, it's appreciated," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer tailored options.
And finally, make sure that the precautions taken to protect databases are taken forward.
"Digital fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin, from Thales.
However, because of a lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy specialists continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, made me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," Andrew Patrick, from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A 210 km/h driving driver with a hot drink between his legs was given an order of £1,000.
A car driver was given a fine of £1,000 for driving 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in the Essex, was found driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on 27 May.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be carried between his legs.
At Colchester's Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his permit led to a six-month withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and an overtax for a victim of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners to blow the London bubble
The Treasury provisionally ranked the capital gains tax measure but expected a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, registered a 7% stamp right for properties that cost more than $2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold property in a company rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp right already applies to residential properties of the arrondissements of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 million over the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook stated: "As a result of the increase in the right of stamp on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this matter, it is very difficult to see that high-value properties are under-imposed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to the idea of buying properties in London or current owners reluctant to the idea of selling," he added.
The prestigious real estate – the 5% to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located in the south-west of London, leaving Fulham in Wimbledon, increased by a record percentage of 11.8% in the last year.
Prices in central London show a steady growth of 5.6% in the year but have been eclipsed by a growing "internal market", the southwest of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experiencing a recovery, according to the studies of Savils.
Scientists have just highlighted how a dog's tail movements are related to its mood.
Previous studies revealed that happy dogs moved their tails further to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs moved it further to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trente, said: "Everyone knows that, in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that as in men, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to disorderly tail movements from other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies where other dogs were.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We have presented to dogs the movies where other dogs were – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion factors – and we have been able to traffic the tail movement and present it as going more to the left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression rip the tail to the right (from the dog's point of view that rips the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they found a tail drifting mainly to the left (once again from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that the dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not be worried about.
He added: "If you encounter other dogs on several occasions and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react to this experience."
Researchers indicate that results could enable owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their animals' emotions.
The expert in canine behaviour John Bradshaw, a guest professor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that the dogs were turning their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when their tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what is in the Italian study."
He indicated that the differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not consider the animals of the films or the robots dogs as being dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs might be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, recorded in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and the dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys report a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock band postponed a concert to Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed to its singer.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to take place in the concert hall The Hydro in the city centre on Friday.
However, his laryngitis forced the singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys stated: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, Arctic Monkeys also have to report the show to the Hydro de Glasgow on Friday, November 1st."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets that he cannot happen in concert."
The show at Birmingham's LG Arena will be held on November 20th, and the show at Glasgow's Hydro will be held on November 21st.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, announced the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest churchmen placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – this is therefore a group of 120 "elector cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony at which bishops would be exalted to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistory.
"The Pope Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the consistio from February to advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix catholiques said by February, the number of electoral cardinals will probably decrease.
He stated that a pope generally appointed as many cardinals as it required for the number of electoral cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
Next year's Consistio will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
For the time being, there is a sort of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine the means of reforming the church.
Previously, the Pope had decided on his own.
"From now on, François chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "very possible" that François asked for advice from cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero said that Popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities in the rank of cardinal, but François was "full of surprises – so we do not know who he will appoint".
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the headquarters file
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado pickups and GMC Sierra 2014 to resolve a problem with manually tilted files, according to a statement on Friday from the American Vehicle Safety Regulatory Agency.
On some pickups, the front seats could present a defect at the tilt mechanism level.
As a result, files do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recollected models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important launch of vehicles for the first U.S. car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect during the first fifteen of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the information letter to the owners because of the 16-day cessation of government activities, which slowed the growth in vehicle sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% over the first 10 months of the year, said GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 Silverado pickups and 16 503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock course has risen by 1.4% to $37.47 in the New York stock exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday afternoon, in Montreal.
The drama took place around 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
Depending on the likelihood, work on foundations had been carried out in this area for some time.
A mythian foundation wall has just been built over the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived on the site to recover his tools.
I was driving by and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered him.
We saw only part of his back, it's so sad.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in her 50 ’ s who worked for a coffer company.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by emergency services, but were unsuccessful.
The man has not survived his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Labour Safety and Health Commission was dispatched to the premises to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The Cry of Despair of an Obama Voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts through the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and restore my hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memoirs of the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical records at night and went to bed, this book goes back to the time when the policies inspired millions of people and the talks could cut your breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the presenters of news newspapers took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the transition period in Obama before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, it is like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (the law on affordable care) to the departure of Iraq from our army, by the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the murder of Ussama ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and Guantanamo closure, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended Obama's administration in the face of my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of the Americans, nor the prosecution of the denouncers that reveal the government's evils.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the avoidance of public funding and the overrun of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the White House's efforts to reduce the media to silence are "the most aggressive... since the administration of Nixon".
And more recently, she cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, like Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and poorly refined alternative that did not seem to allow him to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, who was elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that have been heard for so long.
However, while the positive index of opinions plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses for Clinton's benefit to the Pennsylvania Springs.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get on the right track and remain loyal to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are here five years later, Mr President, and I do not agree with you anymore.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Retinne Street in Fléron.
Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, had no helmet.
Despite rapid relief intervention, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
The billionaire MP Clive Palmer advances that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of this system.
The Mining Mining magnate, which contests the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued this argument in an attempt to remove the questions concerning a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's girls were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of her daughters is pregnant, she will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave," said Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of a remediation of the suffrage clearance system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates on a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballot papers.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone doesn't agree?
Today, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed options for electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties "very seriously".
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We do not seek reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of dusted dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, head of scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Milieux (OCEAMM) returns for the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of hardwood dolphin surprise you?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
If, in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of species classification science.
However, it is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to challenge the classification or membership of a species to a kind, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are challenged because of the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two very morphologically close species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
Ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific bossed dolphins and Atlantic borough whales.
Recent analyses made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and hence its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present at that place.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we may have a problem with the extinction of a species, rather than with a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered by the number of existing individuals on Earth, i.e. stock, and the possibility of recovery from neighbouring stocks.
With regard to the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new discovered species has emerged, its stock has automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there are numerous genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than knowing what lives in the Mariannes pit, just 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on the search for life on other planets than marine research and it's a long time that this changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its foreign exchange market division from two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global survey of regulators on suspicions of manipulation of the foreign exchange market begins to bear fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with regulators in the most important financial market investigations in the world, where 5.3 billion US dollars change hands every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and the other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had transmitted instant emails and messages, sent to and from an old trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his post as a European accountant for foreign exchange at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European accountant trading manager at Citi, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged.
The record of Mr. Usher included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, adding sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had attempted an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma stated that he was investigating suspicions of handling the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine the allegations made regarding bankers that would have been heard to manipulate exchange market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicated sources close to the file.
Banks use instant messages and emails that have been sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
News about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines in investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year due to the low volatility of currencies that limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market for highly liquid exchange, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having a low-cost impact on the market."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had returned a trader working in its office of the funds negotiated the London Stock Exchange this week after it caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been mastered," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
The investigation on Mayor Rob Ford was beaten, supporting a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen an investigation "so messed up".
Me Ruby told the Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested the occasional friend and driver of 35-year-old Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, and accused him of video extortion.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police also said they had observed this man delivering packages at Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby has described as "inexplicable" the fact that the police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put on his phone, claiming that police chief Bill Blair has chosen to know why not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and conduct a search - even without a warrant.
It could also require an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesperson Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's words as "an obvious and desperate attempt" to be argued with the media in a matter that does not concern him at all.
In a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said there was nothing in this video that could be "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Fellowships falling to mid-term, except London
With the exception of London, the main European Fellowships are declining on Friday to mid-sense, led by some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to increase.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could set off its quantitative flexibility policy sooner than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street are witnessing the emergence of rising US actions, after two consecutive repeat sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4.33%) records the highest replica of CAC 40, led by the warning on the outcome of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, having also published results in decline this morning and announced the creation of an internal bankruptcy structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion of the most risky assets.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the forefront of EuroFirst300 increases in response to press information that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculations on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy go hand in hand, as John Hardy, the strategy at Saxony Bank.
The ECB's unique mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong reduction potential for the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to decline against the US currency and has hit in session a lower than two weeks at $1,3517.
These same conjectures support the euro area's bond market.
The Supreme Court validates Obama's Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today stated that Obama's ratified health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges validated the mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Act on the Protection of the Sick and Afffordable Care) – which requires citizens to support health insurance by 2014, with the penalty of having to pay a fine – and declared it to be constitutional under the government's tax authority.
The president of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most Liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page Act and considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered under the penalty of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates at the presidential election in high school during the 2012 primarys, including the candidate Mitt Romney, had strongly opposed the law.
Vibrating tribute to the veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as numerous patriotic associations, paid tribute, this Friday afternoon, to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Gerbes were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MP Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Acrofixion between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday, 31 October 2013, during a violent collision at the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, 1 November, after the depletion of its fuel stocks, announced the Palestinian Enclave's Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another frame of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by tank shells during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younès, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a Palestinian tunnel
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and armored bulldozer raided a hundred metres inside the territory before leaving.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqué, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulated the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell in defense of the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupant in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas assures Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," threatened the spokesperson.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and destined, according to the military, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to trade them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device aimed at the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and injured five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," said the spokesman for the army Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck a military base in north-west Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles destined for the Shiite Lebanese movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday, 31 October the Al-Arabiya satellite channel.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details on the target.
"In the past, targets were transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing "exclusive resources" that she did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain stated that "the bombing aimed at a shipment of air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that fights rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn in an air defence base at Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Danse Dance his two new group choreographies: the first inspired inks and poems by Henry Michaux, the second inflated by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black ink to white.
A white screen served as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advances, profile, ending as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henry Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole room: an array of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next graph appears, incarnate, emerge in the current.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in soil relays, in group with the unison (a mass that makes the solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Gloire du morning", where, in the solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, put online at the front stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be cracks when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance rug, to deliver, micro-handed, unspoiled or held, a portion of Michaux's poem, monocord and monotone in the scream, and continue dancing.
And the music of going out, and the sequence of going back.
This long, powerful, sound discharge, if possible, ends up sweating and swallowing.
As is done by the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - such as those hair that depletes or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It seems that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, imposed himself, with his tics.
Result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
The inks of Michaux, like the forms of Gestalt, open a wider and more gypsy imaginative than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers struck by stroboscope light and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches magic.
The audience liked it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the break, are richer.
The scene is partially paved with grays, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in a deserted house.
On the piano, dancers rehearsing to play the partitions.
Their misappropriations in music, touching, give true fragility.
On stage, they go through couples, in lovers, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, sets that move, choirs, writing is less binary.
Bouffons appear, as well familiar to Chouinard, flying the red nose, in love parades very polarized men-women.
Loves are carnassiers, fugitives or players.
The gestle, laughter and small screams beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of the bodies in coitus, of the beings that melt.
But the play takes its real turn after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored overlap, the cabotain dancers, descend among the spectators, gloating, smoke, circling, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a savantly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness are sweating, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are prosecuted for Northern Patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents has launched a flood of patent prosecutions on Thursday against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company that he co-operated at the stake during the sale of patent auctions that took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 Md, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent-infringement companies before the United States Court of Assess in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow to display advertising in relation to search terms on the Internet, have indicated the findings of the trial, which is Google's business heart.
It was not possible to contact representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture telephones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which provides fierce competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally propose $4.4 million.
After losing the Nortel patents in front of Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 million, a partial market based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although they failed in their attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google violated and continued to violate those patents," said the findings of the trial.
Rockstar claims more important damages and interests against Google because he claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a home in Gesves, who made two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a defective water heater, indicated Friday evening the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The expert posted on-site by the public prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas accumulation.
The life-threatening prediction of the two victims is still under way.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and was severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying at his grandfather's and his companion's house, was at his side and was burned lighter.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before they were taken to the CHU of Liège, in a helicopter, in an ambulance," said the villagemester José Paulet, who descended to the places.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnée has stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected President to swear
Mohamed Morsi has lent the investment oath, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he lent the investment oath to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was removed from power 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore in front of the 18 judges in black dress of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer formed in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for over 84 years since his formation as an illegal organization and severely suppressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to acclamation of the new president and, starting from the presidential façade of the Mubarak years, the circulation was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the very frequent streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the charismatic "relief wheel" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has greatly strengthened since his victory and his speech on Friday during which he tried to appear as not only the Islamic candidate but all those who want to finish the work begun at the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the wooden hall where he has sworn.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fan who played the national anthem while he was in custody.
Marechal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." surrounded by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and former foundation of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from which the uprising ended the authoritarian regime of Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former president defeated him, deposed him.
But by agreeing to swear formally before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The falldown in the USA has slowed the rise in the car market
The 16-day closure of most federal governments has weighed on the growth of sales of cars in the United States in October, showing the figures published by the manufacturers on Friday, five of the six main performances below expectations.
The three major manufacturers of Detroit show two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
The analysts expected an average of 15.4 million sales in an annualized rate and corrected seasonal variations, but the market stood at 15.3 million according to the estimates of Adam Jonas, an analyst for Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight brake strike is primarily explained by the government's "shutdown" and its impact on the consumer's feelings in the first half of the month.
GM however reported an increase of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared with 211 563 expected by the consensus.
The four brands of the group saw their trade performance improved compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit, among other things, from the success of its pick-up, saw its sales advance from 14% in one year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was waiting for 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared with 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also have sales below the consensus, despite increases over a year of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM's action won 1.4% at 16h35 GMT, while Ford yielded 1.1%.
Renault plunged into the Stock Exchange by Nissan's warning
Renault accuses Friday the biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after his partner Nissan Motor announced that it had reduced almost 20% of its annual net profit forecast, reported traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a review, also announced a rescheduling of his leadership.
Several traders reported that Renault's action was affected this morning by "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's warning profit," said one responsible for the trading of a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault has 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to Nissan's website data.
Greece: two dead in a rifle near a site of the neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was badly injured Friday night by gunshots fired by two people who were on a motorcycle passing by a local neo-Nazi golden Aube party in the western suburb of Athens, a police source was learned.
The police were unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that golden Aube members had argued that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized according to the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorist service posted on the central avenue of the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident occurs a few weeks after the prosecution of six members of Golden Aube, including the party's leader and founder, for participation in a "criminal organization" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his call rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league matches of his club champions, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barça for having shot at Neymar, the Scottish environment saw its suspension extended to three UEFA meetings.
In a communiqué, his club called himself "very disappointed", believing that his call was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the black, Montérégie with 13,464 and the Ottawa with 8642.
The large Montreal region also knows its lot of pans with nearly 7,000 private power homes in the metropolis and Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has reviewed its forecast of net profits to increase and hopes for record results through the Australian and UK vacationers.
The travel agency is now expected to achieve a underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million before tax, against a previous estimate of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million reached in 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre had made 8% of profits in the first half and that the second half had begun in force, in particular with regard to travel other than business trips to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and a number of them have been on the right track to achieve record results throughout the year before interest and tax deductions have been deducted," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the biggest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded during the second half of the year, which compensated a domestic market for small-scale business travel.
Similarly in the UK, the Flight Centre leisure travel sector has achieved good results while business customers have spent less.
Her subsidiary in the United States recovered her losses during the first half of the year where seasonal demand is lower and was expected to benefit over the entire fiscal year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns draw on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unknown colognes opened the fire on Friday at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making victims, as a result of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
Assailants fled, the spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, police general Abdel Latif, explained.
This attack occurs when Egypt receives almost no tourists since the army has deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and suppresses in the blood the manifestations of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the course of English literature, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to today.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A combined course of English literature and language will be deleted.
From 2015, students will have to pass an independent-language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education needs to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamentals next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Review Regulatory Office, will unveil a re-engineering of the CSEG structure, with a new rating system and less courses.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, stated that there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," stressing that the CSGCs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
By comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore spend about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GSC of deep math – as well as the greater importance given to the material in international classifications – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of training.
The programme will focus more on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and widely challenging the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An eight-year-old welcomes children with a Muy rifle for Halloween
The minors aged 9 and 13 made door-to-door calls for candy on the night of Halloween.
One of the riparians of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The old 86-year-old man explained to the gendarmes he was afraid of.
His weapon was seized.
The former chief of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"They were buried in 1945 in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he assured the daily large-drawn drawing by relying on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the After-War.
The German secret services, the BND, were both in and in the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were totally wrong.
"As of August 1945, Müller's body was found in a provisional tomb near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a command," said Mr.Tuchel.
He wore "a uniform of general."
"In the left inner pocket were in particular its service statements with a picture," he continued.
Bild also issued a document from the district of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormous taste.
"The memory of the victims was greatly crowded out from the foot," he incited himself in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He took part in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and, in particular, was led by Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroonian villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 Héros CNN of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, for the chosen "Heros CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alter the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the sequelae the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken her abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle has spent years with his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to obtain any treatment he might receive.
"It's not easy," added Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock, crash at the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor per 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 people.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and as many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 surgical acts free of charge last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaoundé.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they start in vans after setting the medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult terrain to get to the villages that need the most help.
Chance doesn't always follow them.
They have had to push vehicles many times to cross muddy rivers or tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received in hero: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people on each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this itinerant hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive shells, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, city or house; after the intervention, the patient rises and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers are working until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's an intense rhythm, but the villagers' musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
"They hit drummers all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," Bwelle explained.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work she has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian physicians and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts free of charge in the past year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to making this hospital live and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteers in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity for field learning that they do not have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help put the blood on or pass the instruments on to Dr. Bwell," said Miss O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students usually pay for their travel to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, their transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt about it," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh and to relieve pain are the reasons why I am motivated to do that.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long painted Pierre Nora to define and situate.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but stressing its weak for the crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrary of others' works in his Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
In fact, they ignore the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair that employs Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Of course, but knowing that such a sacredness cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the the thesis, of which it has passed.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakening, an encouraging and fruitful work, but observing that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this image uncertainly the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he has attached his name, has also contributed.
The poor languages were able to see a giant flea market, presented by a smart commentator, with a sharp lookout and deafness, but undauntedly amateur.
The two books published by Nora are soon two years old and have already determined that the one who passed by not to write had much and well written.
The book here should render him final justice.
Yet, once again, the temptation of the ubiquity, the intellectual vagranting, the retirement set to jump as feet attached from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the handkerchief to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It's a concern of the time.
Here is little, we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders of the time, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, compulsory jacobinism, was entrusted to authorized prefects and subprefects.
The one that suits Pierre Nora is everything else.
He is not a heir to eternal frankness, he refuses to define himself.
Worry analyst of a strange family, he wanders into a forest of symbols, arrested at each step by an object in the form of a waste, tormented with irritating questions.
One of them, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so sustainablely settled within its borders, so long-standing and solidly masonned, do these dramatic calls mean to unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to conjure the disorder born of the disagreements of French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignos, Catholics and Protestants: the divisional forces here are very old.
And the most emblematic is of course the one that fails in two national history.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; concerned on the contrary to regaining its sacrality and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility that it had cut its head to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invinciblely binary nation, shared between the left and the right, secularity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this unique French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escape could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, and wanted to establish a new society.
But the American cousinship only makes it better to highlight what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to care.
Here, men covered with an Old Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confit.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here are the revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make, and who have remained intertwined.
There is an institutional constancy, and here there is a cascade of constitutions, such as errors to catch up and trials to resume.
France who leaves, France who comes
However, there was a time when the French believed they could use the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
In this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then used to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in the former France obscured modern France and providing them with a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only one time.
Here again in the debate, surrounded by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed in European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that leaves and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With a bonus, the portrait of the historian, which should reserve a few surprises.
We found out there that the fireplace was a married man.
The man of multiple curiosity revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The windshield was located in the centre of the centre.
And the one who had deposited, here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had withdrawn from the initiative exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, with grano salis, that he will have finished doing it.
Certain in a less sharp, thinr and thinr form.
But let us not be mistaken, just as binding.
As far as the figure imposed by the university course is concerned, this thesis says the internal need for a life.
An old hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Taken in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team filming a Hezbollah event, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he has participated in the establishment of the "Otages of the World" hostage defense association, which he has been president of for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to complain and bring their hostage takers to the International Criminal Court.
Detained more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grace military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have been able to find their families since.
And gradually try to take the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages of the world".
From the night of your release, you were on the 20h stage of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
On site, especially in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it makes it black - Roger Water.
He says, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me that we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tenuous too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tenuous.
They're putting us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive at the Summerland hotel site where the press is present.
From the French take us to the Embassy of France.
It's the time of the first string shots to the parents, the family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night talking with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to the airport of Larnaca in Cyprus.
Arrived there in a helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did you arrive on the French soil?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a bit brutal.
There's an incredible compass.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and it's full.
The descent of the plane's staircase, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers took a dump to take pictures and followed me to my place where I had to do a little police to prevent some of them from going up.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media fire.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to manage.
But we've been tougher.
The same night, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV.
Then start a kind of life-rehabilitation, very gently, for a month or two that are a little like vacations.
How did medical examinations and DGSE debriefing take place?
I had the right to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grace the following days I returned: radios, exams of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know we can count on it, remember it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostage takers.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of the Niger?
I'll listen to what's said.
The debate on ransoms, in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I try to share things between my questions about my past as a hostage and my chasket as president of the "Otages of the World" association that allows me to put away the distance, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting with others for the recognition of the legal status of hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
The taking of hostages of "political" hostages - which is the case most of the time - must be qualified to allow hostages to have access to justice, to complain and to bring their hostage takers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why don't we say to hostage takers "you have broken the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be grounded, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but don't listen, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
The anger rages in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of the president dechu Mohamed Morsi, they went down the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected President.
It is not a trial that highlights this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial, a pro-Morsi, is supposed to have Sisi judge, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Confrontations broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo police academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel criticizes 9 American States for violating homosexual rights
Since the federal government has recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and to benefits coming with," the Minister in New York recalled in a speech before the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to spouses of the same sex in the facilities of the National Guard" established on their territory, he denounced, challenging those States to violate the federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these maps, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these databases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said he had ordered General Frank Grass to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The leaf of the nine States began by Texas that refused to implement these benefits on the implantations of the Texan National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texan Act and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Western Virginia, according to a senior defender.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the Reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition should bring together the best skating players in the region.
Registrations are held on site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin in the round, at 10 a.m., before the scheduled final at 3 p.m. and the price is set at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young prodigy hyerois Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for European championships in Copenhagen and he doesn't like it until he shows up to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
The Mayor of Toronto hunts journalists who come to ask him about a drug case
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug use, according to several media outlets.
A video sent to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always refused to have eaten crack, while grateful for having a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he threw out his property several journalists came and questioned him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or comments.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday, October 31, that a case of rabies had been detected in a caton in the Val-d'Oise, evidently of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The rabies diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological survey was initiated to identify and take care of persons who could have contacted this kitten between October 8 and October 28, inclusive," the Ministry of Health and Agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received a preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rage, administered after contact with the carrying animal, but before the symptoms appear, is very effective," the communiqué states.
The departments now appeal to persons who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucosa or on a skin injured by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 18 hours from 1 November.
"France has been free from rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free," according to the communiqué.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "autochtone" case of recorded rabies dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on an illegally imported dog from Gambia was registered in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," the departments recall, and it is transmissible for about 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama goes backwards on his health system reform
In an avalanche of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received notice of termination from their suppliers, the Republicans criticized the president over the past few days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with adequate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "an effervescence in the news" about the resiliations, President Obama urged the Americans who were receiving this advice to seek new market assurance.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better-suited health plans for the same price, even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get out of it," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population that hired themselves were forced to change their regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "happily".
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she added.
I'm looking forward to your trust.
It was an exaperated Kathleen Sebelius who made this sentence, while she believed her micro-cute, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly meeting to follow up on a controversial exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, to know if she should join the Obama.
For more than three hours, Billy Long insisted on asking Ms.Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel pulls a special helmet in Abou Dhabi
The happy elected Jake Vite Prekop combined the colors of the brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, a quadruple Formula 1 world champion, has played out for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from among 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of his stable.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and so he can see the German champion, on the track and on his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday to the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet for the race for the 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his suburban party
Let us not be deceived above all else.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only addressed to the banlieusards.
I chose a map of France as a logo, justifying it.
When I speak of suburbanism, I address myself to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It does not prevent its project, presented on Thursday in a press conference in its village of Aubervilliers, from being born of a desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural pot meeting that characterises above all the neighborhoods.
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, it says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territorially attached, now claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militating in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if right-wing people are ready to support me, I will listen to them, too, and he will continue.
There's only extremist parties I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its programme -consultable on the Internet - from many themes that are meant to speak to the people of suburban times and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years old, the rehabilitation of the housekeeper function...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend its ideas on the political scene."For the municipal elections of 2014, this could be just, it recognizes."
It's a matter of time and money.
The suburban Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope in other cities as well.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that there are already seven list heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I've received since yesterday don't all come out of suburbanity" he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedented, that the American spying "had gone too far in inappropriate way"
John Kerry pointed out a slowdown in the US's defensive attitude towards his monitoring programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, the espionage "was gone too far in inappropriate way".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on "autopilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by Denouncer Edward Snowden on the NSA's spying activities took place.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War and up to the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had exceeded the borders, but he insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, make them explode and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they do?
We have indeed prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will go to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged US espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, explained Thursday the President of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken to the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had posed about the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration caused by the surveillance of the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain at our side in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a democrat serving his first mandate, and president of the U.S. Senate's subcommission of European affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I am going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has hampered relations with some United States allies, but the agency's director said this week that it was inaccurate and that this was a misunderstanding because it involved metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents circulated by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence Services, James Clapper, justified the spying of the allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip from Congress, which should take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and from both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this journey was to improve relationships, but also to demonstrate "affectiveness".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes that they have been implementing themselves for years.
"We can modify our monitoring programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do spying," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the resentment generated by the US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, led by Shell's bad results and after an announcement by the Fed of maintaining the state of its support for the economy, as expected.
An Australian woman's prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in Phuket for falsely alleged being assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed for trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Province Court on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, along with two other men who had held it, had attacked him early on Sunday 10 June.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after she separated from her little Australian friend.
Phuket's police interviewed Bamford for two days before she admitted to having invented the history of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15-day imprisonment in a low-security detention centre on the Phuket outskirts rather than in a women's prison.
He is the daughter of the former player of the Australian League of rugby Peter Tunks, who called on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We have, of course, had a anxious moment, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a deposit of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thailand's judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Michelle Smith's Phuket, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to rekindle his deteriorating image with tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
French police will stop Anderlecht's supporters coming otherwise than with the cars of the RSCA
The French police decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain fixed Tuesday, communicated Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson of the Brussels-mid police zone, Friday.
The Belgian supporters of the RSCA who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stage," the spokesman transmitted.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture indicated that measures have been taken to arrest and even guards," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This has motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and educational staff to think about ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The Society Vision diversity has been in school for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Big names of writers, artists, whether they're in trouble or they've come.
Who are our builders?
"So, we create projects so that they identify themselves to all this," explains the president of Vision Diversity, Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne of the New World Institute identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of Quebec culture, sense of belonging, support for staff in the transformations we live in within the student clientele," he says.
The School Commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys has created a research centre that will provide tools for teachers who, at times, also come from.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Different educational strategies, that's the real need," she summarizes.
Research will cover inclusion in all its angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
