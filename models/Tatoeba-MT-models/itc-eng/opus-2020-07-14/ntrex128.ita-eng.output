Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned about "making the figure of clowns"
It is apparent that some Members of this House are upset when faced with the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of Parliament of Wales).
This proposal arises as a result of the programmes to amend the name of the assembly in Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that "he can have rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means cretin and pwp means cacca.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed to be "open" to change the name, but pointed out that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (pagliaccio).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is given in a similar way to the English pronunciation of the letter U Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently in the process of drafting amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what will be called the Members of the Assembly be of course a subject of debate for the members themselves."
The law of the Wales Government of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which has shown broad support for the possibility of calling the Galles Parliament Assembly.
As regards the title of the Members of the House, the Commission has expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option has received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could be a scratch for President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians shall go to the polls for the referendum on the amendment of the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name in "North Macedonia Republic."
The popular vote has been organized in an attempt to put an end to a dispute going on for decades with the neighbouring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long stated that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opposer of the plebiscite for the amendment of the name, said that he would not take into account the result of the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply the price to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent while the churches of Harlem are in difficulty
"The elderly I spoke with say that in the past there was a bar and a church in every corner," Adams said.
"Today there's none of them."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize in a different way today," he explained.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood halls that people regularly attend."
As far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that the money derived from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and then they will come back where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condominiums filled with the type of people who will not help the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for this reason they will hasten the time when these churches will completely close because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will become a member of these churches."
Both churches were built by brothers before Harlem became a black quarter - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation with the head of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led boycott against the dealers of the 125th street, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote colour people.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned his reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a color musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who passed to a larger carillon at the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, constituted by lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese "searched to download the costs" on the parish assembly although the latter had not been involved in the assumption of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Squalo wounds a thirteen-year-old in avocado fishing in California
Official sources state that on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was immersing in search of lobsters in California, during the opening day of the aragon season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV of San Diego that for half an hour he had been immersing himself with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swimming up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first he was just excited about catching a lobster but then "he realized that the boy was crying 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His whole clavicle was torn apart," Hammel said when he reached the boy.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the hospital Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical conditions.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said during a communication to the media that a shark had been sighted a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper thoracic area.
The authorities barred access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad until Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's programme a boost to the beauty sector in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the important push towards the UK £2.8 billion beauty products market, which continues to grow while sales in fashion and household items decrease, the biggest courses dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 shops in the country and adopted in more shops next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use space on shelves once dedicated to televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double the size of its offer of beauty articles up to the 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most products are vegan - a quality that is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance dealer The Fragrance Shop will experience authorizations in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which he opened in Croydon, southern London, while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a move towards the purchase of small quantities of food daily at small neighborhood shops forced supermarkets to commit more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, said that the sales outlets are going to be more and more like the large warehouses while the supermarket chain tries to resist discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's introduced the Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and also introduced several Habitats since it purchased the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy gave impetus to food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to return enamel to its shops of beauty products and pharmaceuticals ended in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from pharmaceutical sales points in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its 281 point sales pharmaceutical activity in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of a wide range of luxury brands of leather care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to respond to every need and the inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby paraded from a £11 million deal
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones is furious after the TV presentationer Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract with his brand of tendency to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of Truly housewives and accessories.
The couple's activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptroew's.
This Morning's presenter, 37, used Instagram to announce her abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, furious after having withdrawn from their profitable trend brand activity at the last minute to focus on his new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furious" when the golden girl on TV admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his commercial empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - for a value of £1.5 million - did not allow her enough time to dedicate to their brand of Truly homes and accessories.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Poutrew's Goop and it had been calculated that it would double the estate of Willoughby, estimated around 11 million pounds.
As soon as he was 37 years old, he chose Instagram to announce his truly abandonment, Jones left Britain to head for one of his holiday residences.
According to one source, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's highest priority.
It was supposed to be his long-term future that he would commit to it for the next twenty years.
His decision to abandon has left all the people involved completely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at the Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that leaving the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions because of strong investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and because of possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby conceived Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together and Jones had a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV program "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones said last night that "he doesn't want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticisms he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have judged "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice to imitate the "television conductor".
"I have not given up on anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first event in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed the world leaders during the UN General Assembly held on Saturday, which North Korea did not observe an "equivalent response" from the US to the first disarmament operations in North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out, the USA is continuing to impose sanctions to maintain high pressure.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are getting great results," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the liberation of hostages and the repatriation of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationships with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded field, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing hundreds of victims
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations had been informed that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been dislocated, the national emergency had not been declared an essential requirement for activating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a little complicated," Summung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will meet in Palu, it is not yet sure that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether the international agencies would have been allowed to contribute to aid.
In view of the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other coasts.
The obvious lack of an alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although alarm had been made, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo has put at the centre of his electoral campaign the improvement of Indonesia's branded infrastructure and poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit Joko's administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko must also face pressures from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been taken away from their homes because of clashes on the streets between Christian gangs and Muslims, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimental weapons.
Look: Daniel Sturridge del Liverpool matches against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea with a point at the 89th minute on Saturday, in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 metres from the Chelsea gate, with his team below for 1-0.
He touched the ball on the left before he threw it on the second pole.
The attempt went high over the frame of the door as it turned towards the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga by squeezing in the network.
"Just try to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as far as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've seen Kante come and I've got a touch and I haven't thought too much and I've pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the 25th minute goal marked by the star of Belgium Eden Hazard.
Blue's centerer moved from heel to Mateo Kovacic before sliding away near the middle of the field and shooting in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick transition to midfield.
So he ran a beautiful passage that led Hazard into the area.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up on the second pole with a sinister goal beyond Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Naples in the round phase of the Champions League at Wednesday at St Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters said on Sunday morning.
Many people were reported trapped among the walls of the collapsed buildings following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that hit the country on Friday and which generated high waves up to 6 meters, communicated the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, has been destroyed by debris from collapsed buildings.

The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "rescription of history"
Its removal would be poetic justice for its taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by its Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "follia" and a "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became a goal.
The iconoclasty during the British civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to be still to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell has been considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case of the monarchy.
That this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the seventeenth century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents a part of this fracture.
Its results as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Maial killer hits a Chinese farmer killing him.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in South-West China based on news from local media.
The man, identified only with the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a receded artery, covered with blood near a pig market near Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder prepares to inject vaccines to pigs in a farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
It is reported that he had traveled with cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and found that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood on the nose.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had crushed the breeder, according to the statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and macillate," said the cousin identified with the surname "Wu", as reported in Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent you from attacking other people, while the police collect evidence on the crime scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the death of the farmer.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal out.
After a Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can serve as "catalyst."
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious... they don't want to hurt.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa's rags will carry strong extended rains in the south-west of the USA
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on northern Mexico and on the south-western coast of the USA in the next days.
Rosa recorded twenty to 138 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, at 5 ET Sunday and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north of Sunday.
Meanwhile, a sack is being formed on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the western coast of the USA. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm, he will begin to push a strong tropical humidity toward the north, in the south-western part of the USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day of Monday.
Thus, the tropical humidity in contact with the approaching bag will create heavy and extensive precipitation in the south-west area in the next days.
At the local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and possible debris in the desert.
The tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is planned in some areas of the south-west, particularly in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods may occur with rapid worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rains could make river canyons in full and the temporals will bring wind to bursts and raise dust.
The nearing looting will cause heavy local rains on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery rails.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona toward the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more widespread at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Strong rains will fall on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be strong fluctuations in temperatures in the USA as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to important temperature variations on short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in the central US will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a close to 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A hot start of October is expected for most of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26 oC from Southern Plains to the north-east areas.
In New York you will be able to reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature of about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate a high probability of temperatures above average for the Eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people followed on six television networks Thursday the successful deposition by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute turn on Friday: an agreement devised by the senator of Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week survey of the charges.
Ford informed the Committee on Justice of the Senate that it is 100% certain that Kavanaugh slapped her in a drunken state and tried to strip her during a party to the superiors.
Kavanaugh, during an infamous deposition, claimed to be 100% sure that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, it's a audience similar to that for a football playoff game or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, led all the networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the entire day's audience, communicated Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was taken over by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take a lift to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He remained with his eyes low for several minutes while he was being reproached and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while many women are powerless."
Flake said that her office had issued the statement and declared, before the elevator closed, that she would have had other things to say during the hearing of the committee.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present the nomination of Kavanaugh to the entire Senate for one vote.
But Flake said that she would do so only with the assurance that the FBI would analyse the charges against the candidate during the following week, as requested by the democrats of the minority.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made her decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have had the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political doing" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized his programmes of letting the European Union "political face" with the future of Britain and jeopardizing national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, 29 September 2018.
In another side-by-side interview with the Prime Minister on the front page of the daily newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers for Brexit agreement, claiming that a proposal according to which Britain and the EU have to collect their respective duties is "absolutely ridiculous"
Wayde Sims murder: Police arrest the suspect of the death of the player of the LSU Dyteon Simpson
Police arrested a suspect of the firearm death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old player in the ULS.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder, said the Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims lost glasses during the fight.
Police recovered their glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB TV station affiliated with the CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted that he accidentally shot Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge's legal doctor's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, which states that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the credit of the task force for the fugitives of the State of Louisiana police, the police scientist's laboratory, the Southern University police and the local citizens who provided assistance to the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of LSU thanked the forces of the area order for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20.
The 198 cm attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where even his father, Wayne, played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rounds.
Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team is "disturbed" and "under shock" for Wayde's death.
"This is what concerns you at all times," said Wade.
Vulcan ash sprinkles Mexico City
The ashes coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity was increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was checking the different rhombs and shocks.
Images on social media have shown subtle layers of ashes covering the windshield of cars in Mexico City district as Xochimilco.
The geophysicals have observed an increase in activity in the equivalent of the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) to the south-east of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 hit Mexico's central area in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police riot teams and thousands of people joined in demonstrations of opponents to remember the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by the anti-smooth police targeted the cops with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dust clouds in the streets that usually intertwine with tourists.
Further beatings occurred during the day with police who used mannequins to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independentists who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" compared themselves with the unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long life in Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for mild injuries received during the demonstrations.
The tension remains high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the government of Madrid but recognized by Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the influx had been low, and the Catalans opposed the secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop violent clashes with the referendum that was taking place at headquarters throughout the region.
The independent groups had stayed up on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narciss Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and claimed that she no longer had hopes about the possibility that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory, although measured by the regional elections of last December, Catalan independent parties have made it difficult to maintain the momentum this year, with many of the best known leaders of the movement that are a voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest with his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from the two factions.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will be taking a stand at the elections of the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the involvement of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: Men arrested after sporonization of a house with car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after they had repeatedly beaten up a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 BST around.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a ballast at a certain point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's victory at 1-0 against the Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with the Livingston has sealed the victory
Livingston already promoted has left the Rangers astonished by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as director of the Hebox club.
The goal of Dolly Menga made a difference while Gary Holt's team went to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team therefore remains without a win outside the Premiership this season and will have to face the first in Hearts rank next Sunday, from which they separate 8 points.
On Thursday the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
Meanwhile, the Livingston continues its series of victories in the division, remaining battled for six games, with Coach Holt who still has to see a defeat since Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston wastes opportunities against incisive guests
Holt's team should have been in advantage well before the goal, with their immediacy that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson collapsed but dragged his action in front of the mirror of the door and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after he got in to meet Craig Halkett's head shot from the other side of the door.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could have put in trouble the visitors with pitches.
And that was how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers have given a punitive kick and Livingston has found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson have managed to move to Menga, which has been able to mark from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and the carrier Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This scheme has been maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos has engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped at the feet of the Rangers' doorkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot off another Livingston game scheme.
Crosses happened in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two demands for rigor, after Halkett's contrast with Glenn Middleton's substitute and one for failure of hand, were refused.
A "female" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Up to the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional path.
Their game style and collaborators have changed very little from their return to the highest series, but you have to give much credit to Holt for the way he managed to spron the team after his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, led by a masterly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall into difficulty throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the good performances at some times with Gerrard, in this case they went down well below these standards.
The last passage is missing - only once they have been able to penetrate the opposing area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, which are found in half rank.
Erdogan received with conflicting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, aimed at dissociating relations between NATO allies.
Issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU have been discussed.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have motivated for security reasons the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators, including many Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Road impact at Deptford: cyclist dies in match with a car
A cyclist died in the clash with a car in London.
The incident took place near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic road from Deptford, in the south-eastern area of the city, at 10:15 BST about.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the hit.
The incident took place months after another cyclist died, invested by a road pirate in Childers Street, about a mile from where the incident took place on Saturday.
The metropolitan police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been blocked and diverted buses and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a high-security male prison disorder, reported the prison office.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin's highest-security male prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST around Sunday and is still running.
The specialized agents "Tornado" were used to handle the riot, involving eight prisoners and confined to an wing of the prison.
Agents were treated on the spot for mild facial injuries.
A spokesperson of the prison department said: "Apartably trained prison staff has been deployed to contain an incident currently under way in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and may be sentenced to a longer prison sentence."
The Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the warden of the prison had to receive hospital treatment following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October of last year, the anti-sommosa agents were called to intervene in the prison to wake up a violent riot during which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (of which the drought-affected areas could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to strike the Arizona, but it is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest of the desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The national meteorological service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona to the South and Eastern Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly on Phoenix Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
The national weather service of Phoenix reported in a tweet that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Center for Hurricanes forecast precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with peaks isolated up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the south-western area, including the Central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden floods, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of these rainfall will probably be positive because the south-west is currently going through a drought.
According to the drought monitoring centre, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," saidweather.com.
Initially, the route of Hurricane Rosa will reach the mainland through the peninsula of the Mexican Baja California.
Rosa, who still maintained the hurricane force Sunday morning with winds at a speed of 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm will meet the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with force of tropical storm in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high flood risk.
"We expect precipitation between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-western area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, to then head through Arizona and towards southern Utah in late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or by its roots are intense precipitation in Baja California, in the north-western area of Sonora and in the south-western desert zone of the USA," the National Centre for Hurricanes reported.
It is expected that these rains can generate potentially lethally sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as brakes on mountain terrains.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys in a 20-year-old were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in the Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 BST about Saturday.
He was transferred to hospital, where he remains in "stable" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, told Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who can have taken over with the telephone what has happened.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has "suffered for the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh has "suffered for the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during the entire process of appointment.
Kavanaugh filed before Congress on Thursday, denying in a passionate and decisive way Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual violence against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also deposed the audience defending the prosecution.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people could observe Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage" on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the minds of the most experienced law of our time, a lawyer with inapplicable precedents in the public service," said the supporter crowd in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh speaking of the importance of the republican influx to midterm elections.
"A five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I really do," he said.
"For this lot strictly for exceptional candidates."
Trump said the democrats are committed to "resisting and hindering."
The first fundamental procedural vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to what the CNN told a senior assistant to the GOP management.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami, and the numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that fell on the beaches, when a massive earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach at dusk, sweeping away many people by killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, turning into victims," said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit anything on the mainland," Nuguro said, adding that the tsunami moved to the sea open at a speed of 800 km/hour (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people went up on trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the Disaster Agency have shown many destroyed buildings and shops, billiards and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Assessing raids continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes has been perceived in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake of Friday was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and claimed that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under broken buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were scattered.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be greater along the 300 km coast (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dogalea, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralysed, with no information" by Dogelia, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This and already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you can feel a man on a top floor of a building that screams agitatedly to warn of the approaching tsunami the people on the road below.
A few minutes after a water wall he fell on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief interventions.
According to the authorities, the army has begun sending air cargo with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but displaced persons still need food and other necessities.
The city airport has been reopened only for rescue and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget for the tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to over 800.
It's terrible.
Although the staff of World Vision of Dogelia managed to reach healthy and save the city of Palu, where the employees took refuge under shelters of waxed canvas in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they met scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
"They told me they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even as the relief groups began the difficult start-up operations of rescue gears, there were some complaints about the fact that foreign knowledge-based foreign aid operators were prevented from travelling up to Palu.
The Indonesian regulations establish that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can start to arrive only if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And this has not yet happened.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster", we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
The second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, the friends and family of the dispersals still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a child was extracted from a discharge.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been stuck under the maceries for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the preparation of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the dispersal paragliding pilots.
Other people trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandage, were her students.
"As you will see in the paragliding sector, I am carrying my emotional load," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the spread of news related to the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, stopped to a single sign of gray spring instead of two blue signs.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a refuelling of ATMs in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying a ATM at Newport on the Levee, based on a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The vehicle driver was emptying a ATM in the entertainment center and preparing to deliver another money, said investigator Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "was drawn behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag with the money destined for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspicions that fled the crime scene, based on the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When announcing on Saturday the change of name on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change took place prior to his participation in the Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", declared the creator of the show.
In addition to being a abbreviation of his current professional name, West stated earlier that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio broadcaster.
"That's you, it's us, it's us.
We passed by Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our evilness, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
It's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
An ex-collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has also changed the name with or without a stretch and capital letters.
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people at a time when the student movements on the left were taking foot throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by extending monthly grants to students and opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of training opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for the IA
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double the research funds in this field, says the investor and operator of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of various groups of the U.S. government regarding the IIA, although in the USA there is generally no formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its programme last year: it aims to be the country n. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Redouble the budget in the research of the IA would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in the IA," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the chances that the next major success in the IIA sector would be achieved in the USA, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of the leading companies of AI in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat the American player in Otello with the highest score and later led to Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled the previous technological competitions of the US government as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when to hold the next one, to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the USA often have to work a lot to get money from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking the leaders away from the academic field, it's the multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have taken lights from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the USA to boost its efforts in the context of AI.
"I think green card should be offered automatically to doctors in AI," he explained.
The Chinese Council of State has published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Foundation for Science and Other Government Organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the Department of Defence of the USA has created a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities and the White House has announced the formation of a special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million a year in research on the IA.
Meanwhile, the US order to set up a National Committee for Artificial Intelligence Security has not been active for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on the possible change of the country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve the dispute for decades with Greece which blocked its applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim on its territory and has put a veto on Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposed, but the nationalist opponents believe that change would harm the ethnic identity of the people of Macedonia by the Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he will not vote at the referendum and the boycott campaign has caused doubts as to the possibility that the influx will reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with the accession to NATO and the EU and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is the price to be paid for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority to appear.
The State Election Commission stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
However, the influx was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters had expressed their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector of the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia for the change of the country's name that would open the door to NATO and the European Union's accession to Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Paramento in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov was preparing a small stage and settling the chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to head up, not for the door of service," Kavavarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO's accession will bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required influx.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote for it.
For the referendum to be valid, the affluence must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the philo-Western government since it settled in May of last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City marks a goal avoiding the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defense during the 2-0 match from Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem extremely easy his point marked at 65o minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield passage at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting on the free field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He humiliated a defender before overcoming several others at the limit of the Brighton area.
So he made a left pass, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton Mathew Ryan's doorman with a right shot in the network.
"Aguero is having problems on his foot," told the reporters, the coach of the City, Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he was able to score at that time."
But it was Sterling that initially brought the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came at the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in depth on the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling towards the second pole.
The Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball out shortly before he left the field.
The City will fight against Hoffenheim in the Champions League round at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another beginning.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a match on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least one retread with a 5-2 win against the Nationals Friday evening, but still hope to get their title in first division.
"Even if we play without objective, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
And why shouldn't I want to win?"
Nationals still have to announce a first launcher for Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer go into such situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, held a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher on his normal Sunday of rest.
The launcher of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump to a rally in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the influx of Republicans during midterm elections.
"All we've done is put into play in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big ones -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really going to do this for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: "We see this horrible group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any necessary means, you can see evil, wickedness.
They don't care who can hit, who has to flaunt to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give them."
The democrats, he said, gave themselves the mission of "resisting and hindering."
"And it was possible to see him in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "wrong, bad, petty and lying."
He referred to the Committee on Justice of the Senate with Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, triggering strong fisches among the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you been trapping the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uhm no, I'm waiting one - that was a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
He doesn't tolerate people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a great surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to whom we have been told not to be welcomed, and all because they have said what they thought.
My fellow Member, Mr Ryan, has received similar treatment because he has been opposed to anti-Semitism in a way that is so resolute.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all arguments similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour on Friday states that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, the meetings of Friday evenings were exactly like that.
However today is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and courteous" policy has long been forgotten, if ever it has been remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on the basis that it is acceptable or not for party leadership.
All of this began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect an inversion from me and that he took positions that I would never have accepted, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it does not really matter what I say - they follow inventive insults on social media that call for my withdrawal, denouncing the policy of the center and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than my fellow Members because the comments I make tend to be of a political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a stream of sexist or racist insults every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the standardization of the levels of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of rejection or modification of the selection rules, the party is restricted.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower the head, not to express my views so openly and everything "would have gone well".
But it is not to do that which I have entered into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the concern of the Thatcher government that had left my secondary school class literally to fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as local councillor or minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political views, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be left undisputed by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm family nuclei, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy by talking about my loyalty to the chief Labour Party.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunities will stop me from acting in defense of those I believe to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeatable Ayr scale the classification
Two late attempts might in some way have undermined the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr has deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun start of Tennent's championship day.
I'm now at the top of the class, the only team that's up to ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their daring, who pushed the house team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still beaten, so I must be pleased," said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "It is necessary to recognize the merit of Ayr, they have better exploited the opportunities of us."
The goal of Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow poster for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the game, allowed the Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot reached an unconverted goal.
Climo has increased the Ayr's distance with a rigor before, just in half time, to mark and then to convert a goal alone to bring Ayr to 17-5 at the interval.
But the Melrose started the second time and goal of Patrick Anderson, converted from Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
So there was a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was made to spread, and at the start, Ayr was rebounded to benefit thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted from Climo.
The replacement captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson has therefore received a yellow billboard and Melrose has made the man pay more with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow poster for a contrast with Climo without ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson marked a touch down behind the mixing in progress of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost since the start, after Rowe had collected the football from David Armstrong's area and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the house team.
Star of Still Game is looking for a new career in catering
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after finding out he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and interprets together with the long-standing partner Greg Hemhill.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final show and it seems that Kiernan is thinking of a life after Craiglang.
According to the lists of official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to issue statements, although a source of the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's "prosperous catering trade."
'The sea is ours': the Bolivian undisturbed on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path towards the Pacific
The sailors patrol a general naval district covered with sartyame in La Paz.
Public buildings exhibit a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours right.
Recovering it is a duty."
All over Bolivia without a headlight on the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in hand in Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as well as the desire to release once again the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"La Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course is waiting for the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent dialogue, Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a outlet on the sea of State competence.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial fight for reelection next year - has a lot in dance with the judgment of Monday.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favour of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice arrives just six months after the final rings indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’ said Paz Zárate, an expert Chilean in international law.
And long to advance the Bolivian cause, the last four years could have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
The belligerent rhetoric of Morale has set any good intentions left in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions as a result of what happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly rapid.
On Monday Bolivia will be able to "have extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantage," he explained.
Calzadilla also denied He Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - is using the maritime issue as political squamotage.
"La Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the USA
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never disarm nuclear weapons unless he could first trust Washington.
He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep faith in the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be planning to restart diplomatic negotiations in the state of stagnation after the meeting in Singapore with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an "illusion" that the continuation of US sanctions and opposition to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea to its knees.
Washington disagrees by issuing the statement without making important disarmament actions before Pyongyang.
Both Kim and President USA Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang's intention to renounce an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows the latest trend in huge covers that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to enlarge your collection of covers or completely block the rays of the sun, don't look any further.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a series of overcrowded crazy overcrowds for their spring-summer 2019 collection that have impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Very little practical hats have upset Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their exciting creations on the walkway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige-colored hat decorated with a broad edge similar to feathers that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled anguries, a squirt hat and even a pineapple - but were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have sewing lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than with high stitches.
One creation resembled a complete immersion with masks and eyeglasses, while another looked like a dissolved frozen cone.
And if you continue with the huge statements of style, you're lucky.
The style observers predict that the enormous berths could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
The hats outsize arrive on the street of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide tessa more than one meter that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very little practical hat that invaded the social media sent another huge creation in the walkway: a large beach bag in straw almost as much as the costume model that carries it.
The burning orange flair bag, finished with a stripe and a white leather handle was the strong part of the spring-summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrities designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big hats and beach bags to arrive in luxury shops next summer, because the designer has had such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for over-accessible accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results to the examinations, strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further higher education, career choice and their place in the world as global citizens.
As the field of education able to develop and adopt a personalised school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular subject and demand within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that understands, the message will come to his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will come to the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to create trust relations with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can observe that the languages are at the top of the graduates, with the highest percentages of success in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages got the maximum vote.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72% of students obtained the maximum vote with Chinese praise, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the maximum vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, who will no doubt need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of matter, are considered at the same level as STEM materials (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% to a lack of language skills.
This is why language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities that require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level in order to maintain a conversation and the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of more languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance to find a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from indipendent schools, with the teaching staff specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, regardless of their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative competences."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entrance with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-sampioned opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be set for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans were for the six-game pre-sampioned Lakers program.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly games to prepare myself," she said.
The moment of the gathering a West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the beginning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a refined gathering.
This is the first meeting of the five planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation pending for your choice to fill the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the next midterm elections as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress at the elections in November.
At what time will Trump begin and how is it possible to follow him online?
Trump's committee in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow Trump's website in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the audiences of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who have become stubborn because of the allegations of sexual violence with an early vote of confirmation of the Senate pending for a week while the FBI conducts the investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get a little push.
So, President Trump's campaign said that these five meetings over the next week are aimed at "giving energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the increases they hold in the Senate and the House of Deputies," being in Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial for its programme that the president will travel in as many States as possible as we are in the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesman for Trump campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's committee could call back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh's media," standing at the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in queue in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, sitting in Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: USA team shows the courage to fight to keep your hopes alive until every single Sunday
After three single-way sessions, the afternoon quartets could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The motion of the oscillating pendulum is a fully invented sport concept in which players believe firmly and never as in races like these.
Where's the bike now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I'd say we're keeping a little moped," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is in favour of, of course, four points ahead with another twelve at stake.
The Americans feel they have a bit of wind in favor, as Spieth said, and have a lot to be hoped for, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each boasts three points in four.
Spieth has been upset by the tea to the green and is giving the example.
The bells of celebration have become stronger as the game continued, sinking a crucial putt to match the accounts to the four game, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His whore who got them to win the 15-hole game was greeted with a similar scream, which tells you that he thinks the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to put it all to worry about your game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with multiple points of Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed version of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four in four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to pull a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole on Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow from and to the busy crowd strengthens the certainty that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to suggest a possible European victory while the sun passes over Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, the speeches of European glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon made it to Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double boget on the first nine holes drowned the Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they did not even manage to climb.
However, on Sunday there's no one to help you get out of your hole.
The fourballs and the foursomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and that they don't give and the way the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage on the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 on the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage on Ryder Cup's final day after completing the four-and-a-half-saturday football and four-saver matches with an advantage of 10-6 on the United States.
The inspired couple composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score to Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to preserve the lost trophy in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning fourballs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has more resistance in the forsome, winning two games, but they have not been able to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four row points while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are the second couple to win four points from the four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat down a fallen Woods and the American exorctant Bryson Dechanbeau with an even cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself for two games on Saturday, showed occasional strips of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and in foursomes and seven rows.
Justin Rose, at rest during the morning fourballs, returned to the side of partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results expected in a pleasant and ventilated day to the southwest of Paris.
The three times great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans with two points Saturday.
They won a brilliant 2&1 win on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the forsome, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point gap passing to the individual, although as the owner, Furyk's team only needs a match to defend the trophy.
After being the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of range.
North Korea completely refuses unilateral disarmament without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of the sanctions was ignoring the country's mistrust in the USA, that in such circumstances he would absolutely refuse to give up his nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the General Assembly of the world body that North Korea has adopted "important measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling of the nuclear testing site and commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the USA there will be no security in our national security and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves for the first time."
Although Ri has re-used the complaints concerning Washington's resistance to a denuclearisation "in stages" with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of gradual actions, its statement was important because it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearisation as it had already done in the past by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first meeting between a US president in office and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal end-to-war agreement in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States has claimed that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed appeals to ease the rigid international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need to "have a denuclearisation first" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to obtain their purpose in a coercive manner and even oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion that those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our refusal."
Ri did not refer to programmes of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced to the UN at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister emphasized the three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the counterpart of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be dead at this point."
But even so, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year's speech to the UN General Assembly, when he said that it was inevitable to aim the US territory with the North Korea missiles after "the President of Evil" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, gave praise to Kim for his courage to embark on the disarmament path, but declared that much still needs to be done and that sanctions will remain in force until the denuclearisation of North Korea.
Wednesday Trump declared not to have a deadline, stating that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated on Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "The respect for the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and accurate denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported the North Korea sanctions in 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and later declared that he would have visited Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip has not gone well.
It was broken up by Pyongyang in July, claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea he had accused him of having submitted "requested by gangster."
North Korea had committed itself during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the USA had adopted "compliant measures."
He stated that Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees to which Trump had committed himself to Singapore and actions towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has driven all its students to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing virulent culture of studying for whole nights fed by caffeine.
A college student found that students at university number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes to be the first of this type in the USA.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that had given about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end a girl came to me and said to me, 'Why did you tell me this only now, when I'm last year?'
He said that no one ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which made me very surprised," he told The Telegraph.
The course, for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of Health Services at the University, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour involves a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is the image of a bedroom, where students can select cups of coffee, curtains, gym shoes and books to be able to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of a night routine.
In another section, participants are explained how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, therefore encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the "white night to study", still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to a lack of sleep being a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue, anxiety, has explained and should even help to avoid fattening because the lack of sleep brings the brain in in indie mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after having followed one of his lessons last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote an entire campus course.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all graduates to follow a similar study program before joining this competitive institute.
Prof. Czeisler advised students to set up a wake for when they have to go to bed, as well as for when they have to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send the circadian rhythm in thylt, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga’s goal strikes Gerrard’s men
The Rangers suffered another attack of depression from outside the house with the goal of Dolly Menga that relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team to a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Hebox was looking for the first victory out of the house from the 4-1 triumph of February to St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team hit Gerrard's second defeat in 18 coach games leaving his team at eight points from the leaders fleeing Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Rangers formation never seemed able to match.
As the Ranger now goes down to the sixth place, the Livingston goes up to the third, and only behind the Hibernian for the difference of goal.
And there might be further problems coming for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line was cured for a head wound due to an object apparently thrown out of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly exceeded Ayr in the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that took a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated its opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated by possession of ball but Livingston has better exploited the balls at his disposal.
They could have just signed after two minutes when the first-time Menga filter passage sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's door but the midfielder wasted the opportunity.
A football of deep punishment of Keaghan Jacobs therefore found Captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow could only pull to the side on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but seemed to have more hope than belief in their game in the area of rigor.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he had to see a rigor when he died of the 15th following a fight with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice at the door in the first time but the former porter of the Ibrox Liam Kelly did not let himself worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's opening goal at the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that it has earned it even for its commitment.
Once again the Rangers failed to manage a football placed in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact since the wing stuck a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself off the door line to lock it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly into the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long ball after the other.
Holt's team might have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor objected to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The substitute for Rangers Glenn Middleton presented a final demand for rigour after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanacco: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and the CONTEGION continues... the day when the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger counter.
A firm point of science since then, the counter Geiger has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by those unbelievable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to identify radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earpieces on, you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "There's a bit of a blow going on now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can therefore "see" a protein common to many types of tumours and are therefore re-injected
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her cancer disappear to ovaries for over 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their laboratory alteration so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and therefore these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the USA based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
Her2 protein "promoting the growth of different types of tumors", including breast, ovaries, lungs and rect colon, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for the extraction of immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to affect tumor cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself in a pro-Trump diarium wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was stabbed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live episode after a disenchanted performance during which he praised the President of the USA Donald Trump and claimed that he would apply in 2020.
After playing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA hat, he started a riot against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk white so many times and they say, "How can you please Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a screen whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star took the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Commission against the charges of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been transmitted, registration of West philippic has been uploaded to social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to play West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad time in the backstage because of his cover.
"They bullied me in the backstage.
They told me, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And so they told me that I'm a marginalist," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I'd be wearing Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try love."
His comments generated cracks at least twice from the public and members of the cast of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with a person who told the magazine: "In the studio a deadly silence has been dropped."
West was invited as the last minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West has bewildered many with a performance of the song I Love it, disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support from the head of the group of TPUSA Conservatives, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Grateful to HAVE TEST TO THE MASSA."
But the show conductor Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "what it is and this is just wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (purchasing his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") that I think is embracing an empty ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
This is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend rapper, Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion and of course the legendary music disappeared Prince, who had changed his name into a symbol and then in the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast East Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant will have to present himself to Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
The Stone Throne Star Harington Kit attacks the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a fighter Jon Snow in the violent fantasy medieval Spade Throne series.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that these soles on screen often make the boys believe that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit claimed that "something went wrong" and thought about how to handle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of Spade, 31 years old, admitted to worrying a lot about this problem.
'Personally I am very concerned at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we're watching now?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in menculinity by its very masculinous characters.
He continued: 'What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, which makes the boys think they should be in this determined way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the young.'
In the course of the interview he also admitted that he would not interpret any prequel or sequel of the Sword Throne once the series ended in the next summer, stating "to have finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play the main role in the True West revival of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a rapist.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing happened with the Sword Throne.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in the fantasy series winning the Emmys.
The couple married in June 2018 in the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to sources of health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases have already been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual HIV transmission is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual relations within these reports.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff has been trapping the data of the GOP senators, and speaks of "dangerous lies" and "cospiration theories".
On Saturday, the U.S. MP denounced the charges against a member of his staff regarding the publication of personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles said that the statements were fostered by opinionists and websites of the " ultra-right wing".
"Wugs, lies and still despicable lies" said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, issued by an anonymous of the Campidoglio during a hearing of a commission of experts on sexual violence charges against the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
News leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts has been associated with Waters' office and have issued information regarding a Waters staff member.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been challenged as a result of these false and biased accusations, has in no way been responsible for the leaking of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' assertion has quickly generated online criticism from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is furious," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he hasn't done, he mustn't get angry.
It must not be provocative.
He must not question the accuser's reasons.
You must remain calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by the detractors of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to destroy Waters in midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"A lot if confirmed," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office has warned "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these trendy claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they have to respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English Review hits again - spy parody with a low-sized Rowan Atkinson
It has become common now to seek references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems to be applicable to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The rebirth.
Will the veiling of self-screw on the subject of how much crap we do be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits has obtained his license to insinate things for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that is a comic creation developed for countries of non-English cinemas.
Of course it is the silly secret agent who despite his strange glamorous claims has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that guy who contributed with a single note to Gloria's theme moments of the opening ceremony of the Olympic games in London 2012.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man who once interpreted Atkinson in the now forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, who left the chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English coming closer to the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers shudder briefly against his elmo.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but humor seems quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that brands of film "seri" like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems directed to children rather than adults and for me Johnny English's crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson's silent movies when Mr Bean plays.
Today's unchangeable premise is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker infiltrated the supersecret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with the disorder of the officer in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the drop that makes the vessel trip through for a presumed and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a stroke of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character-like-Teresa May but there's not much to work on in the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that every single active spy has been compromised and that you will have to call someone already retired.
And this means that the evil Johnny English, who now works as school leader in a chic establishment, but who also imparts official lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gag, when English offers a school of Rock-type spying course.
English comes back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a girl role of the high society in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of the disasters for the secret services of His Majesty are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the network of the charismatic billionaire of technology that claims he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, set fire in a French restaurant; unleash the hell by smuggled into the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to take dissemble with the inside of the Volta house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as much as garbate and exuberant, there is a lot of TV for children throughout history.
Everything is quite modest.
And how did it happen with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to be preparing a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, even though they are paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way employees could enjoy a week of three days, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with plans to turn the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a day of four days was endorsed by the union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior Labour Party member said to The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year the announcement of a revision of the political line is expected."
"It will not happen from day to day, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to the balance of the economy in favour of workers, as well as its industrial strategy as a whole."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week under the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is not currently the subject of discussion."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to highlight his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless managers" and "speculators" in public services companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies might not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour Government could implement "deductions" on the basis of behaviors considered unlawful.
It has also confirmed plans to include employees in business boards and to create funds for inclusive participation, so as to transfer 10% of the net assets of private sector enterprises to employees, which end up in the annual dividend pocket up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI survey on Kavanaugh might change their mind
The FBI's investigation in the context of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court of at least a week, and raised the doubt whether the findings of the government agency could influence or not any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview going on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible that the FBI might bring something to light that might induce them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said it while I was going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, that he came out of that charge, I said, "Did you do it?
It has been resolved, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems carved in the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could resist a bombproof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you name has not been able to prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new in change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the performance of a remarkable star trolley and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
Upon arrival at the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people spilling over the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also an awareness of the real purpose of the event, that of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way that would help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But, exactly, how successful was the Global Citizen Festival now that there are 12 years left to achieve the intended purpose?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a genuine way to persuade people to apply for an action call, or is it just another example of the so-called "clicktivesm" - people who feel they really do the difference by simply signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, operated for a multitude of different purposes.
He states that these actions have helped urge global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than 37 billion dollars, to influence, by 2030, the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In the early years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which they have already been reimbursed or used as funds at least 10 billion dollars.
The group estimates that the protected capital funds have so far had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executioners based in the United Kingdom, committed to "help children grow to their full potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make sure that social injustice or malnutrition becomes a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 action has been taken to appeal to the United Kingdom because better the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through interventions for nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we frame and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of those who will be performing this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement a "block" and hinder Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington may, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russian sources of energy from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, has revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as mentioned by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the Russian involvement in Syria - particularly, where he is working on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they find themselves in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern tip of Europe," he would have said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with them.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval block, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the defendants at the event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that self-defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, that of making financial levers and replacing fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "poor versatile", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its natural liquid gases to Europe, and replace Russia, an option that for European consumers is the most economical.
To this end, Trump officials, including President of the United States himself Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to get out of North Stream 2, a project of "inappropriate" gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Moscow's "prisoner" Berlin.
Moscow has pointed out several times that the North Stream 2, consumed by 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of the existing one up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Cremlin objectes that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting held in September in Moscow with Rick Perry, US Secretary for Energy.
The US position triggered the negative reaction of Germany, which reconfirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organisation for industry, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the United States to remain out of the European Union's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a major problem the fact that a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "in serious consideration" of candidating to the Presidency in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will take "serious consideration" of candidacy president following the midterm elections.
During a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he had the opportunity to apply.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and put our corrupt government in place, and that means having a woman to the summit," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously the president's candidacy."
During the Warren City Assembly he said about President Donald Trump, saying he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, by him appointed to the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: "It's natural that we need an FBI survey before the vote."
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's same voters did not think it should be candidates in 2020.
58 percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not compete, according to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey gained greater support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed on a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of the Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden stated that he will make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he's back, I can put him in relation to other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the injuries our soldiers are going back," he told the public at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there's that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a report for domestic violence and possession of firearms under narcotics, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the Columbia District support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen States and the Columbia District support a legal battle against a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and the District of Columbia Friday presented a friendly curiae memory in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the appeal Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties submitted in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He stated that his partner "and his violent children members of the gang" abused her, but the United States officials rejected his asylum application on 20 July.
She's been locked up in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations that face explosive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reiterated a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed an application for asylum to immigrants without documents fleeing from domestic violence.
Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of the specific circumstances and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition violates that principle", states in the memory of friendly curiae.
Within the memory, prosecutors have also objected that the policy that bans the entry of immigrants is damaging to the US economy, stating the clear likelihood that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labour".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges not to guarantee asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or a political opinion," Sessions said on 11 June, in the context of the announcement of the political line.
Asylum has never been thought to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people have to face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu while the budget of the deaths doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her little feverish baby in a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At every moment there's an ambulance that brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, ruining among their fragile personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the earthquake of magnitude 7.5, were completely overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, victim of a shoulder fracture and back, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being cared for outdoors due to the continued severe harassment.
He was filled with tears as he recounted the sensation given by the violent earthquake that shook the room that shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed in the walls, I believe," said Haris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "doing prepotence" with "advertising propaganda"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement on a U.S. newspaper, announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
Last Wednesday President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, an accusation that China rejects.
The prosecution by Trump, regarding the fact that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections, noted what United States officials reported to Reuters to be a new phase of a escalation campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a trade war in escalation that has seen them adapt their duties to their imports.
China's retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, as the Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a great exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China has written Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now it increases those pre-positions by publishing advertising on our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Viceversa, in the school on the road here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese people might have on the problematic economic trajectory of China, as the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most insignificant newspapers has eluded the offer to publish" his article, although he has not declared it to be a newspaper.
The Republicans are alienating the female electorate before the middle term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
Since many leading Republicans defend the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are on their side in dealing with various sexual harassment charges, analysts have reported that there will be a negative reaction, especially by women, during the future half-term elections.
The turmoil in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
"You can't withdraw these things," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher has stated to doubt that the last minute of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s insistence on an FBI survey will be sufficient to placate angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow nor November," said Friday, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning the protesters repeated the slogan "Novembre is coming!" in the course of their protest in the Senate room, when the Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are going to the stars," said the news site Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they were already tall; that's true.
But they could be higher, especially between the indecisive electrics of the peripherys and young voters, between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts had assumed that a negative reaction could have occurred if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP has become a confused set," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about voting for the committee, the final one, or if Kavanaugh will be put on board, it's also about how the Republicans have managed the situation and how they have handled it," said Guy Cecil, director of priorities USA, a group that helps elect the Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to whom they believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a smaller percentage in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents have certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they have certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in the course of his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to what The Guardian reported.
Last week Ford witnessed under oath, before the Senate Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh assaulted him as a Jew when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed her genitals during a party during the studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that derives its origins from Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," said the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their "online personal data store" or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, musical libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the store of personal data online is that it is completely at the user's option who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal storage through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology programmers around the world will be able to give life to their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team won't tell "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely cleared from one day to the next.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to procure commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the Great War Ecclesiastic with Victoria Cross
The only ecclesiastic of the Church of England to be awarded with a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
The lieutenant colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, obtained recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had reached the highest level of British military honour.
On Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, her two grandchildren opened a commemorative plate.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" the fact that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years from the prized prowess of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battle beyond the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and war machines".
Then he hurried toward the line of fire and with the "best galantery" made the line advance before he ran with a single hand cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know he could never be high and something that makes him more humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he was truly honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by many people."
MMA fans stood all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been waking up all night to watch the famous 206 Bellator just to see you denied the vision of the main event.
The San Jose program included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the United Kingdom during the night, live on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some were grounded after being woken up until the first hours of the morning specifically for the fight.
On Twitter a fan described the passage to cartoon for children as "a kind of joke of bad taste".
"The government regulation states that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so you had to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked for the transmission.
"Pep the pig," "yes."
"The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they will work on programming to include viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably find a solution," said Coker.
"But there are six in the morning of Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came in and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you that next time it won't happen.
We'll limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we've tried to get so much for the fans, and we've just discussed it.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" because of sexuality
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he's raised feelings less than anyone because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
On the 24th year, he stated that he did not realize, until he arrived at secondary school, that "not all are like me".
Speaking in the first episode of Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that becoming a parent made it possible for him to care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual presentation of the old-time program, Kirsty Young, took a series of free months for illness.
Introducing himself as a marginalist in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" to anyone else as he grew up because "the fact that he liked both the boys and the girls was not socially acceptable."
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and of feeling different, was the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if by chance they discovered his sexuality.
The twice bronze medal at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and has used his face in this year's Commonwealth Games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice heard because he was fortunate to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world champion three times said that the fact that he had fallen in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 - "has struck me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When he passed so much in his youth" - he went to his early Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced such heights and lows.
The two became parents in June, of a child called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" changed.
"If I had asked about it last year, everything was about the fact that "I had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know one thing, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'you wouldn't be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I still didn't realize it wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I only knew what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a crowd in the Olympic Games, there was no feeling better," she said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud of Heather Small - which had a particular meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still makes him come the skin of goose.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-form Mickelson put on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Miccelson will mark a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to re-assess himself to prevent him from becoming an impeccable stone.
Miccelson, playing in the biennial event for a 12th time as a record, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it was often for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between making cheerleader and working on his own game in the rank, hoping to correct what torments him.
Since he was never the strongest driver at the peak of his career, the 48th year is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the missed route regularly punishes the wrong hits.
And if the path itself wasn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faced the accurate champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the novel Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the beginning of their 12 individual matches, start with a hot start, the Miccelson match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a package on my shoulder, put an arm around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I had imagined more, but that's the way it went and that's the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even mirrored the heights of his personal record.
Miccelson has 18 games, 20 defeats and seven matches, although Furyk said that his presence has brought intangible goods to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, witty, he likes to play people, and he's a great guy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that younger players have had the fun of cementing themselves against him this week, something that was fun to look at.
He's done a lot more than playing."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable resort.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 meeting in Valderrama where the team, headed by Seven Ballesters, despite a five-point detachment from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimum advantage, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I kept repeating that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but recently," Bjorn said (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
"That's why it's going to be the story to prove to me and my team that's not over.
Tomorrow we have to make the most of it.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It is not finished until the points are marked in the sheet.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy the way his men raced in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have passed.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performance, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfer skills are tested hard.
This is the message that you have to deliver to players: tomorrow, you have to pull out the best of yourself.
Then forget about your partner because he has to go there and get out the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, counterpart Jim Furyk will look for the best individual performance in its players than team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself from both sides at those big meetings of the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start immediately with the right foot as we did at Brookline and Medina.
When the game starts to take a certain fold, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way that we think is appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of driving the counter-defensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
The new German military ship was postponed again
According to the local media, the last frigate of the German military navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the times of the cold war, but there will not be at least until next year due to defective systems and an impennance of costs.
The commission of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the Admiral of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesperson.
The ship was supposed to join the military navy in 2014, but worrying questions following delivery have haunted the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the military navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years away from the national ports.
However, the continued delays mean that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power beyond the sea, will become obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F-125 frigate announced last year, when the German military navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the military navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little has been known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have noticed a number of crucial "defete software and hardware" that have made the ship useless if employed in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the oldest ships in the Bremen class.
In addition, it emerged that the ship weighs definitely too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the possibility of adding future updates to the military navy.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it has reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involved in the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, MP for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military navy actually "loads ships capable of being used".
The official said that the issue was significantly worsened over time, since the old unarmed ships were not replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the military navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal the way bats use the view to get food.
It is confident that discoveries can shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and soprano, as well as the brown ears and bats of Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
Analysis of the recorded sounds by an expert will determine the frequency of the bats and the manner in which each species behaves.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a naturalist for the NTS, hopes that the results can reveal which habitat areas are more important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to maintain the forests for bats and other related species at best.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
The bats are at risk because of construction and development works that affect three-fold and ruin habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as the mosquito paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to grasping a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles to their path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the three villages and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organization even established the first reserve of Scotland intended only for bats at the estate of Threeave, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory.
"Here in Thrave we have a vast area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many secular trees and a good habitat.
But there is much about bats that we still don't know, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about their need for growth."
Stresses the importance of controlling bats before carrying out maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single mother-in-law can kill up to 400 females and small children, perhaps by tearing away an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disturb them, to disturb them or to destroy their truces.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of Scotland for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said, "We still have much to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how they pass their populations."
Ronaldo rejects accusations of rape while the lawmakers are in charge of the German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo labeled accusations of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to advertise" with his name.
His lawyers prepare to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker from Juventus was accused of violating an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also noted Friday the charge of the payment of $375,000 to keep the silence on the matter.
In a video on Instagram directed to its 142 million followers, in the hours following the accusations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, broke the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the Golden Balloon five times facing the camera.
"They want to be advertised by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the footballer smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the charges, called "an inadmissible report of suspicions on the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent corresponding to the severity of the privacy violation, considered probably one of the most serious of the personal rights of the last few years".
The event would take place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would return to the footballer's room, where he submitted it to anal violence, as reported in the statements filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would get on his knees after he happened to be for "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by "one percent".
From the documents it appears that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual relationship, but that was consensual.
Mayorga also states that he went to the police and to the hospital, where his injuries were photographed, but that he subsequently agreed to a conciliation agreement because he felt "terrorized by the overthrows" and worried by the prospect of "being humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old now seeks to overturn the agreement, claiming that she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the event, and this summer will join the Italian Juventus with a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will always regret the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "may always regret" the loss of its status as a world leader in the construction of cars following Brexit, said the Minister of Industry Greg Clark.
He also said he was "concerned" about the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC on the possible exit of Britain from the EU without an agreement and the consequent momentary blockade of production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automotive home argues that delays at the borders, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston factory, in which Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
It increases the concern in other British car manufacturers for the exit from the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit will close its Mini facilities in Oxford for a month.
The main concern is the risks in the supply chain experienced by manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on the basis of the "just in time" concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from English and European suppliers for ordination cars.
If on 29 March the United Kingdom will leave the EU without an agreement, there could be some disturbances at the borders that would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so the production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely thought to avoid these disturbances at borders".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity," she told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain."
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production could stop, but in the long run, it should warn that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of the plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates of the plant, says that the workers are deeply concerned: "According to my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reinstated".
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "journed for a week", while the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continued, declared the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the special prosecutor Robert Mueller investigating Russian interference to the elections, the links between Trump's advisers and Russia, and the possible obstacle to justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, fueled Washington's gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a summit to record conversations with Trump and try to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and shouted that he was going to quit.
Instead, it was announced on Wednesday a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of instruction from the FBI on questions against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "It has not been established a date, it could be this week, I imagine that it will be resend another week considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists might object to this: Sanders does not keep a briefing with the press at the White House since 10 September.
Driver Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of briefing is not due to an aversion for television journalists "who put themselves in the exhibition", although he said: "I do not disagree with the fact that they show up."
So he has suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
"The president holds more Question sessions and answers from any president before him," he said, adding without quoting the evidence: "We've checked the numbers."
Briefing will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
Let's try to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions regularly when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president has perhaps proved his reason, making a free-wheeled speech, and at the same time bizarre, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the European workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to stay after Brexit.
The Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance from the United Kingdom to the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of the demands of sectled status (stabilisedly resident status) for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "There have been ongoing negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of a scenario without agreement.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate my appreciation today for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and not only, provide valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, providing benefits to patients and communities to whom we provide a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly desire you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was operated as a matter of urgency following a head injury
The defender of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after bringing a head wound to the Saturday game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost for 31 to 27, as Mike Organ of The Tennessee newspaper reported.
Technical Officer Rod Reed told journalists that the accident caused the wound had occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached on board camp and disappeared," Reed said.
The first aid staff and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombies on board camp, before placing it in the barrel and taking it away for further testing.
A head of the Tennessee State reported to Chris Harris of the WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "no news of the kind and entity of the damage has yet been reported" and that the Tennessee States are trying to understand when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is at its first season with the Tennessee States after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five plaques before he left the game, which brought his total season to 18 plaques.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bubble taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the laborers
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in the price tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Treasury plans to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bubble taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, will announce today Theresa May.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable accommodation and higher income.
The increase in the stamp tax will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be in support of the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homeless people.
The overcrowding, which is added to the current bubble tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the property buy to lets (purchased to be rented), could be more than 3%.
The Ministry of the Treasury provides that it can collect up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers of a first house to enter the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost city" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time out of the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson had asked for a cut on the bill to help the younger ones with the purchase of the first house.
He accused large construction firms of maintaining high real estate prices by taking over land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to abandon affordable housing shares to fix British real estate disparity.
Mr Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposals for reform of the housing market, including controls on rents and the elimination of uncompromising evictions.
He also wants to give the council greater powers on the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said I would be committed to restoring the British dream, that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who did not reside in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as is the case for resident British workers.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate aspiration is to drive Scotland"
The Technical Director of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "great aspiration" is to become a Scottish manager sooner or later.
The Scotsman, 42 years old, is attracted by the challenge of having the North-East team currently in third place in the League One, three points from the summit.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after he was at St. Mirren's guide during the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I've been in B series and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager."
Ross' predecessors led by Sunderland were Dick Advocato, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former technician of Alloa Athletic claims to feel no anxiety in following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me right now is measured with the ability to bring the team back to Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team up."
Ross' career as a manager began three years ago, after a period as a coach assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute for Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa to escape from the retreat to the third level and brought the St. Mirren from the backseat to the title of champions of the Championship, the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more at ease now than during his football career in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls regarding the direction of the Alloe.
"I really thought the role of manager was done for me, more than that of player.
It seems strange because I worked well, I earned a living, and I had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to deal with every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure of work but management seems good.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel much more calmer than I've ever been in my life."

According to one study, the right time for a painting is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer hot wave has brought more incassi to the English pubs in difficulty and more concern to the catering services.
The data show that pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales from 2.7 percent to July, while the incas of restaurants have fallen by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consulting company, put together the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England to the Worlds has made the month of July follow a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were over 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit harder.
The collapse of 1.8 percent in the restaurant in June has worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which you drink mostly proved the most solid, with a homogeneous increase higher than the drop in restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not excessively like the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for something to drink.
In pubs and bars managed the sales of drinks are 6,6 percent high in the month, while food consumption has dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst in the RSM's recreational and receptive sector, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling retail.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to fight, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 percent a year will be particularly severe in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come in a worse period for the restaurants and only time can tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce."
The overall growth in sales between pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the roll-out of the brands.
The sales monitoring company Coffer Peach Tracker for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK brings together and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is the industry reference company.
A child in five has secret accounts of social networks that hide the parents
A survey reveals that a five-year-old, some only 11-year-old, has secret social networks accounts that hide parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 senior middle school students revealed an increase in "fake on Instagram" pages
The news has strengthened the fear that content is posted to sexual background
20 percent of students claimed to have a "primary" account to show parents
A child in five, some only 11 years old, creates accounts of social networks that keeps adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of the "fake on Instagram" accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has strengthened the fear that content is posted to sexual background.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to manage a "principal" account that was cleared to show to their parents, while maintaining a private one.
A mother who discovered the 13-year-old daughter's secret site by chance found a teenager who urged others to "supply me".
The research, of the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of private schools, has highlighted that 40% of boys between 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping their private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces in which parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at the Scott Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in light athletics and President Ian Beattie has described the appointment as a great opportunity for those managing sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a deep respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that in Scotland athletics could draw a huge advantage by bringing it into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I can't wait to act as an athlete's voice and hope I can contribute and help driving sports in Scotland."
The American, winner of 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently BBC opinionist, has found himself unable to walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
He had written on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell me if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a great job, but I took it all back, he learned to walk again, and today I move with agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!".
The advertising of a tidalacte compares mothers and cows and divides the opinion online
A company producing a tidalacte has divided the view on the net with an advertising that compares the nursing mothers and the cows that are mounted.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first silent and wearable tidalates of the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ad in the form of funny music videos to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new tiralette.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I'm taking my milk but I don't have one" and "If I hadn't noticed it, these aren't mothers but my boobs."
The choir continues: "Throw it out, throw it out, feed the children, throw it out, throw it out, throw the milk to my lords."
However, advertising, published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video triggered different reactions among the viewers, many of whom claimed that it would highlight the "roars" of the dairy industry.
"An unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must also be pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their little ones are stolen from them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie's tidalette wears with discretion under a mother's bra
Someone else commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for both the mother and the little one.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a mother-to-mother trullard that will continue to hold their children?"
Someone else added: "It's really meaningless advertising."
Others defended her and one woman even admitted to finding the song "funny".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I'm still breast-feeding, I'd like to have one.
When I used to use the tidalacte, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a little hilarious, but it doesn't get far from reality.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a funny advertising dedicated to mothers who use the tiralacte (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like "male".
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the home industry."
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet tidalacte stuck in the bra.
The concept to which the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use the tiralate feel like cows.
Elvie's tidalacte, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and can be stuck in a nursing regiment, giving women the freedom to move, hold children in their arms, and even come out while they throw their milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD commented: "Elvie's tidalact is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing women who use tuxedo to cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by showing in a fun and easily recognisable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tuxo is able to guarantee."
This is not the first time Elvie's tidalette has reported.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children presented herself on the street of the designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a trend towards the borders of Texas
The number of migrant children increased exponentially even though the monthly crossings of borders remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and political line of Trump administration made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who took them into their confidence were usually illegal immigrants who are now afraid of jeopardizing the possibility of staying in the country and offering to perform such a gesture.
The risk was increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the potential trustees and other adult members of their families would have taken fingerprints and that the data would have been transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in front of Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to rely on children alone.
Later the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the people who offer to rely on children or belong to the families of these people are illegally in the country and most of them are criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people down," Albence said.
In order to try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules for some of them to appear in court within one month from the farm, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to who works at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconference rather than in person, to perforate their cause of legal status in an immigration court.
Those who will be considered unfit to receive help will be expelled quickly.
The longer children remain in trust, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or escape attempts, according to those who work at reception points and the reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the likelihood of this happening is even higher in a large structure such as Tornillo where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children to ignore the signs of discomfort.
They add that moving children into the tendons without giving them time to prepare emotionally or greet friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Intimate Syria to the US, French and Turkish employment forces to withdraw immediately
In his address to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even if the war had arrived at the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally occupying the Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any condition," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 dead and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and support the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by war.
On the problem of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favorable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "unpublished fears" that drive refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should be only a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be allocated in Syria until a political agreement will be reached between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of an Idlib bearing zone, the last important stronghold of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue the political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented an extensive attack on Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will target the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene a new committee of government and opposition members to set up a post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee by saying that the group's work should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will be awarded the second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators may hope, his presidency should not be ended prematurely because of impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of bending of the spectators.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first evening are more than doubled to 1.05 million on the CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million spectators in the first evening, definitely increasing compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program exceeded the percentages of the network reaching 3.5 million spectators in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire where people are attracted because it's not something to explain," says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC's "Designed Survival" television series, telling the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In Scovell, a brilliant comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi race in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Why does he make me laugh?"
Chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington's events can determine the future of Roe vs. Wade's judgment, whether immigrant families can meet or not and the health status of the global economy.
But to stop following the news is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes well beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts discussing in-depth research by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", of Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather jacket ("a garment full of tracotanza" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes of Trump's anatomic parts.
I, for example, will not be able to look at Super Mario anymore without thinking about it.
"Part of why what he does seems to be a reality show is that every night there is novelty," says Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the arrival of actors and daily developments of Trump's show plot (in contrast to N.F.L. praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and even though it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, it was closed at home to watch the MSNBC and while recording the CNN.
He failed to get off TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate's judicial committee and in front of the future uncertainty of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we once made all those absurd programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Exterior cash flow in the race for the strongest half term elections
It is no surprise that in the 17th district there is a flow of money through the realignment of a district of Congress that has made two members in charge now running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburg puts the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb on stage, who won his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in charge, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that in the old districts the electoral colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the republicans.
The 17th District ran a campaign marked by a fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name known in Pennsylvania after a measurement victory in the special elections in March for the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
That place had been occupied by a republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the 20-point district.
Political opinionists have given the democrats a slight advantage.
The United States has thought of penalizing El Salvador because it supports China, then they have changed their mind
Diplomatics have observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 a rather friendly meeting took place between Panama President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization's leadership group to leave.
The officials of the State Department have decided to include the heads of the US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", said the spokesman of the Department Heather Nauert in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was taken only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million dollars of aid for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been of concern to the country of Central America with a high percentage of unemployed and murdered.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America sent a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from leading in the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference and thus give up any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, the diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further reprobate messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson from Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously about the internal decisions.
What they told was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who still wanted to keep the anonymity.
Study history
In the report that will be published, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which they now seem to have sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress were to pass on to democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations before the electors and perhaps to a jury of his peers as he prepares for a new candidacy.
The incognites are many and I do not mean to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is not the case with his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the struggle may last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Monaco.
On that occasion, we failed to let ourselves escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans at the moment must face different.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this newspaper pointed out that last year she secretly suggested submitting Trump to interceptions by questioning her ability to fulfill the role of president.
Rosenstein argues that the news released on the newspaper The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete or impartial or if it will be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the reliable accusations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not pass this test, democracy will have to prepare itself for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we're gonna do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with the Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing match against the Villareal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunity to qualify for the Group G of Europe League.
Although due to an accident on his knees the centrecampist Graham Dorrans played his first match of the season just on the occasion of the 2-2 match with the Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because the Villareal is a good team," said the 30-year-old player.
"We faced the game convinced to do well and we brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis, but, all of it, the match is a right result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points, but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game. I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be able to disappoint.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my accidents and changes at the club level itself but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation is good.
So we can forget the problems of last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term assistance
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have dealt with the topic in the family.
About half of the Nationalwide interviewees said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term assistance.
Only 10% says they talked to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the insurance sector on the life of Nationwide, "people want to be a member of their family to take care of them, but do not discuss this conversation."
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate what you want for a while.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want assistance, because these factors can be crucial to the costs.
Involve a financial consultant: you can advise you how to pay the expenses you will have to deal with.
The choice of funding for long-term assistance may include a traditional insurance policy or hybrid policy on life with ransom value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles to your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you have not been able to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a search for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you have not been able to do so.
Don't forget the details: imagine that your parenting elder will be brought as a matter of urgency to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a matter of finance, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."
Male hit several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with a compressed air rifle while he was cashing on foot after spending the night out.
The victim, a forty-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was hit to his chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a random action".
The victim didn't see his aggressor.
He's not in any case in danger of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died following a severe earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The budget of the victims is destined to rise.
Communications are interrupted and relief officials have not been able to obtain any information from the Domgala regency, an area north of Palu that is near the epicenter of the earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated by Palu.
Here are some essential data about Palu and Dogalea in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Sulawesi Centrale province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the Sulawesi island and with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When she was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dogalea is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, was about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the Sulawesi Centrale province and above all the coastal region of Dongalea.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongalea have been hit several times by tsunami in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Another tsunami hit the western area of Domigaa in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area called Pacific fire belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December a huge earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries killing, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, 226,000 people, more than half of them.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that broke out against the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 fell near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
The victims were over 1,100.
2010: an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake struck the regent Pdie Jaya in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under macerae.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of which in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested with the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Based on a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29 years old, Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting the arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her hand-held phone.
Palin has been transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrian Facility centre and his security has been set at $500, according to the KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in judgment on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin is in danger of being charged with three first-degree crimes, i.e. holding up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also awarded a second-degree offence punishable with a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Court Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic assault, of obstructing the complaint of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a fist on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic syndrome due to stress resulting from the period spent in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that Friday hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity network and the communications network are not working and the victim's budget is due to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit off the Central Sulawesi, located north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media they circulate videos that show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami fell on the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors call for extraordinary capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare punishment that has never been committed since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a home depot rental van to plunge on a cycle track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the conditions for requesting capital punishment in the southern New York district, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed eight victims and "intendedly" inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these counts can lead to the death sentence.
Week after the attack, a large federal jury filed with Saipov 22 chiefs of charge that included eight homicide charges in combination with delinquency, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and an indictment of violence and destruction of cars.
The attack called for "a real planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depravate".
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have gone by since the southern New York district has been in pursuit of the last capital punishment case.
The man quoted in judgment, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to forced labour in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and incriminated for having passed information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's spouses both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police say that in front of the investigators they said they were proud of what they did.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As far as the 22 counts were concerned, he was not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was said to be "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting an acknowledgement of guilt and condemnation of the ergastole without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s group of defenders had previously begged the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory states that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today swore to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the members of the party's parliament in Theresa May suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians must "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone told Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already be out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May must face in trying to reconcile the positions of its deeply divided party have been highlighted by the Tory in favour of staying in Europe who have participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, of those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and to force Eurosceptics and laborers to choose between what May proposes and the "chaos".
At the beginning of the organisation Leave Means Leave held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"At this moment we will be out of Europe," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan."
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servants.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the opinions that public opinion would be changed by the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in Europe is completely false."
Also MP Tory Andrea Jenkyns, Brexit's supporter, took part in the procession and told journalists: "I simply tell the Prime Minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by public opinion in general, the opposition will not vote for it and will not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who drive around the streets in search of votes in order to allow us to be elected.
Let the Chequers Plan be missed and start listening."
In an incisive message for May he added: "The first ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
At the beginning, Farage stated that politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they were going to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to feel the pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the people's army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe have marched on the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour start in the center of the city.
A small number of activists pushed the Torys against Brexit flags after group formation this weekend.
The laburist laughed at the conservatives for the security problems they had with an app of the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus agreement, for the borders without friction and for the unlimited trade in Ireland," he added.
It's a farce.
A good Brexit does not exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering candidating to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections she will seriously think if she is a candidate for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts talked about her future during a city assembly in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often criticised by President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that Trump could challenge in 2020 was in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled.
One participant asked if he intends to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to fix the government and that means a woman takes the highest position."
Arrest for the murder of the LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect for the murder of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday he had released a video of the murder asking for help in identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20 years old, was hit and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims brought a gunshot wound to the head that caused death," said Murphy J. Paul's chief of police on 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene of the crime in possession of a weapon and having hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and held in a state of detention at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
Junior player of almost two meters raised in Baton Rouge, the last season Sims played 32 meetings of which 10 were held with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 payouts per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team's orders
When on Saturday Valteri Bottas qualified in front of comrade Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately apparent that the orders of the Mercedes team would have heavily conditioned the race.
From the pole, Bottas goes well by leaving Hamilton to defend himself from Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stops first in boxing leaving Hamilton in the group tail traffic, moving that could be decisive.
Mercedes makes the next stop by going back to the track behind Vettel. Hamilton, however, overcomes it after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which Ferrari's driver tries to prevent its passage inside, risking to end up outside after a double shift to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen leaves from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
So drive the race for much of the race without stopping at the boxing for the rubber exchange and try to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by winning the fourth place.
In the end, however, you have to make the pit stop on the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps you can't increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, which arrives fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valteri has worked very well for the whole weekend and has been really nice to get me through.
The team did an exceptional job to win the first and second position," Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
In a committee held on Saturday, President Donald Trump surrounded Senator Diane Feinstein for his insistence on not revealing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter that accused the candidate of attempted rape at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a commission in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "meschines, bad and liars".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, petty, bad and liars" he said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is being spread and those responsible say "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the content of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was disclosed at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denies that indiscretion is blocked by her office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, but I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did it."
But his denial is not credible for the president, who at the Saturday evening's committee commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of attempted sexual crime by three women, the president suggested that democrats are using these accusations for their own purposes.
"They're trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see wickedness, wickedness, they don't care about those who hurt, those who have to pass over to regain power and control," the president said as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after the defeat of Friday in the Elite League match against Belfast Giants winning the race back for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants went right ahead with two shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the team home together before Dwyer brought the Giants back in favor.
Francois Bouchard marked the match for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe who on Friday evening in Belfast had reassembled and won the game with the Dundee for 2-1.
The two teams met four times this season and the Giants won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the minute 3:35 on Kendall McFaull's assist, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assist.
In what was a first time rather animated, Sullivan returned the team from home in match to minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the match assist to Cownie at minute 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for Giants by marking the second goal of the evening at the end of the first time.
The house team got back together and Bouchard repaired the pair after a strategic maneuver at the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to the action of Nielsen that brought the Dundee to the advantage for the first time in the meeting at the end of the second time and decreed the victory of his team by marking the fifth goal in half of the last time.
The Giants, who at this point have lost four of the last five meetings, will play the next home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controllers die to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he died to allow a plane that carried hundreds of people to take off and save them.
More than 800 people are dead and many are scattered because of a huge earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong siege shocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped among the maceries in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save their lives, the 20th year Anthonius Gunawan Grande remained in his place in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport of Palu, which was horrified.
He wanted to make sure the Batik Air 6321 flight, which was on the track, was able to take off safely.
So he threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to carry it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"For us it's really sad news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are concerned that the number of victims can reach thousands and the national disaster countermeasure agency informs that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The count of the dead is destined to increase because many bodies are still under the maceries and it was impossible to reach many others," explains the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial developments are transporting aid and food.
Kusuma Risa, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is running low.
The minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything possible to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the men of the army of the country: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air Disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says there is a dispersal after the lagoon accident
The airline that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after saying that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a dispersal.
According to Air Niugini's news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing the appeal.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, e.g. age or nationality.
Local ships allowed the other passengers and crew to be safely pulled away after the accident while the aircraft was trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
According to official sources, on Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline claims that six passengers have been admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable conditions.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane has reached a very low share.
"And was really a fortune," said Jaynes.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and shouted and that he was struck slightly to the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, also some sailors working nearby to fix a bridge have provided rescue using a rubber to carry people on the shore before the plane crashed in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
The data from Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in aircraft accidents of the airlines registered with PNG but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuilds the night of the burned woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution's evidence was completed in the new trial against a man accused of having burned a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The analyst from the United States Department of Justice Paul Rowlett has witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell phone data to rebuild the 20-year-old movement accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed that he recovered the localization data from several mobile phones that prove that, contrary to what he said, Telllis was with Chambers the night he was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with the Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford presented himself in court on Saturday and testified that day was not in town.
When the public ministry asked him if Tellis told the truth saying that that night was in the Sanford truck, the latter confirmed that he was " lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistencies is the fact that Telllis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
On the other hand, the data from the mobile phone indicated that they had only been known for a week.
Rowlett explained that after the death of the Chambers, Tellis removed from his phone the messages, calls and contact information of the Chambers.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final argumentation on Sunday.
The court provides that the judgment shall be brought to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: what is hip-hop conscious?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting in its tracks positive messages.
The High Breed group in Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins when it spreads political messages and reported social issues.
Instead, they want to go back to their origins and make a kind of hip-hop conscious again.
Artists like the Fugees and Common are recently back in the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A pope in New York quotes a couple in court for firing her with a "razzist" text
In New York, a pope quoted a couple in court for discriminating her after she had received a text in which her mother complained that she was "another black."
The couple refuses to be racist by comparing the request to a true "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his disappointment when he discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived for his first working day in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOO A OTHER NERA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice for a couple of times.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the error, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "Imbarized" fired Ms. Maurice saying that she was not happy with their former African American papa, and that a Filipino was expected.
He paid Miss Maurice's day of work and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice quoted the couple in judgment and, in order to be dismissed, asks for a compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially hired, even without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said on Friday at the Post, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by saying that Maurice's dismissal was the only thing to do because they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her a message that she said something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"You would entrust your children to a person you were escorted with, even if by mistake?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a true "extortion", Plasco stated that the wife has been born for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't get along with a person like that.
It is not a very kind behavior," the financial consultant added.
While the legal case is still under way, the public opinion court has immediately denounced the spouses on social media by criticizing them harshly for their behavior and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not appreciate a speaking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's not easy to put in those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's funny now that we know the great success of Paddington."
Affirming that the father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the refusal of his work, adds that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a bit "grid" after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was quite a quiet man, not a presumptuous person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when you have a child reaching a goal: you are proud of it even if it is not your credit.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success this way.
Although he was a creation of his imagination, he attributed credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter who was dying.
At the landing the daughter was transported as a matter of urgency to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't do it," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then she called to tell me she'd be dead in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that the doctors had given them to enable the heart to continue to pump was slowly becoming more reliable.
She died a while earlier, and it was the end.
I had to sit down and wait till I knew this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it."
In the end Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, grieving for the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he says.
"I've always done nothing but cry in my head.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Tickets from two grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," she says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said he would light up every room in which he entered."
But before he died, he left work because depression brought him "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone who can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They must not isolate themselves, they must speak."
Humphreys, who has been Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old companion, not long after the death of his mother.
"You never said you felt down or depressed," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
The Christmas Day touched the background. When the children opened the gifts, it avoided looking them in the eyes."
He says his death was an enormous trauma that they had to develop: "He has torn the family apart.
He smashed us.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI has begun the investigations
"I think if we could proceed as he asked, that is, with a limited investigation in time and within the framework, we could reach an agreement," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "losing calm" because of the blockade of the supporters who were rooted.
Why does Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
Only five weeks to the mid-term elections, on 6 November. If the Republicans as expected will get a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to make the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court elected.
George W. Bush called the senators by urging them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
We will vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the lead and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea's political refugees "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean legislator claims that the number of North Koreans asking for political refuge in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, says that refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,706 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the highest rates demanded by those who illegally release these people.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are offered South Korean citizenship in the end.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns them with force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearisation negotiations that are in a state of stagnation.
This after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to collaborate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the US sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States we cannot be certain of our national security and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament at first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh as "historical" and argues that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the Nancy Pelosi minority defines the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and states that it is not particularly suitable to cover this position.
The Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think that if a woman had behaved in the same way, they would have called it hysterical," said Pelosi about the statement made on Thursday by Kavanaugh before the Senate's judicial committee.
In a visibly excited way Kavanaugh denied the accusation of having sexually harassed Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the mood for emotion, so much to come to almost scream and with the throat tight from the crying as he spoke of his family and years at school.
He has also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the committee who have defined the accusations against him as an "absolute and coordinated defamatory campaign" organised by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
The Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that it cannot enter the Supreme Court because it has proved to be prevented against democrats.
"I think he was self-absorbed with his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh in a state of charge if it was confirmed and whether the democrats were to reach the majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I think that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is he not suitable for the Supreme Court, but not even for the court that presides now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the Circuit of Columbia District.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh dismissed the questions on his intention to overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi stated that "You cannot send a hysterical person and a party to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be accepted in a positive manner".
And women have to use it.
It's a right top, months and years of anger attacks from which he can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"Don't I think it's weird, and you?"
And he continued, "He helped me a woman who was a leader somewhere. He told me that she also cried when she was angry, but he had developed a technique for which when she was angry and started crying she told the person she was talking to "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it went on.
I thought yours was a brilliant idea."
Tears are tolerated as a vent of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in an office mostly male comes back when I once cried for an access of anger. A woman older than me, an ice manager from whom I was always slightly terrified took me for the knife and dragged me along the stairs.
"Don't ever see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy because they've got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, when on a boat called Monkey Business was discovered Hart's extra-council relationship that had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not try herself to apply for the presidency.
"In fact, it was not a well-weighted decision," he said to me about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and there was definitely no need for another one.
Someone called it "Biancaneve and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late for fundraising, and he swore he would not apply if he had not raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause on the way.
He found that some of the supporters who had given men $1,000 to her would only give 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" she asked.
When he had the speech to announce that he would not have launched an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thank you to the people who had supported him, disappointment to the system that made it harder to find money and voters that representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination he was victim of), who committed himself.
"It seemed like you were in a trance at a nervous collapse," Schroeder recalled thinking about the reaction of the press.
"Someone could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my stone.
Maybe "Think a lot."
How the US-China Trade War could favour Beijing
The outbreaks of the US-China trade war have been gross and, while the battle is all over, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with the new duties on articles for over $200 billion (EUR 175 billion) of value. This means that taxes will be applied on half of the goods from China.
Beijing has reacted every time with similar measures applying duties from five to ten percent of US$60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the US coup and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon go back.
Because Washington quits, it would have to give in to his demands, but bending publicly to the USA would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts however believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the USA can have a positive impact on China over the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who studies Asia at the research centre Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supports the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by over seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have abandoned the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million who still live in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime will accept willing assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept any aid subject to conditions or by those countries which supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europa team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National off Paris, France.
The USA has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has won the trophy when the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn has reached the 14.5 points that were used to beat the United States.
The USA champion Phil Miccelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tea shot in the water at the 16th hole of par 3 granting the win to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his shifts becoming one of the four players always to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first played in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the Thorbjorn Olesen ranking of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, has retired for 2&1 to English Ian Poulter who might have argued his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight of them, became the European player who won more in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's a team victory and I'm glad I made my contribution," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his fellow John Ram who beat the legend of the US Golf Tiger Woods with the score of 2&1 on Sunday singulars.
"If I think I've grown up watching her meetings, I'm really very proud I've beaten Tiger Woods," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now he's counting his meetings in the Ryder Cup amounting to 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 matches.
A strange statistic if you think he's one of the biggest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according to Jack Nicklaus alone.
The USA team has been looking all weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain USA Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning, we put pressure on the Europa team.
We've thrown this opportunity away.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players have done very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've put it all together.
But they played better than us."
