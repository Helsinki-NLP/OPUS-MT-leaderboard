The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned about "taking them for monicreques"
Consternation between some of the Assembly members, currently referred to as AM, for the suggestion that they should change the name by the name of MWP (Member of the Wales Parliament).
The debate arose in the plans to change the name of the assembly by the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all over the panorama fear to be the object of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the new name "remotes with Twp and Pwp."
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "twp" and "pwp" means "casca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the set of the group "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservator said his group kept an "open mind" about the change of name, but pointed out that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way as the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Wales Government Law of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals, which showed much support for Parliament's name in Wales.
With regard to the issue of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but MWP's option received most support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AM are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to achieve consensus might result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, of which the bill on changes is expected to be delivered within a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the AM disability rules and the design of the committee system.
The AM will get the final vote on what should be called when the debate is under discussion.
Macedonians attend the polls in referendum to change the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that has lasted for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a complaint from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he would do the omit of the vote.
However, the referendum defenders, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no more than the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent as Harlem's churches continue to fight
"The elders I spoke to said that before there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither one thing nor the other."
He said he could understand that the bars were gone.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to."
As far as churches are concerned, fear that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they will return to where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities full of kind of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain shrines.
"The vast majority of the people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore they will accelerate the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation changed in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation was made with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the shops of 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street that had resisted to hire and raise black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's friars made plans to rebuild it, they took care of the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the charillon as "the bells of the poor."
The expert playing the carillon in July also called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the largest carillon of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have occupied St. Martin over the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the organ that rejects the parish and is made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "asks to impact the costs" on the board, although the latter had not participated in the recruitment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some people have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark strikes a boy while fishing lobsters in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was fishing for lobsters in California on the first day of that crustacean season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinites.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends on Saturday morning when he listened to the boy asking for help to scream, a moment when he was born with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only exciting to catch a lobster, but he soon realized that he was shouting "I've been worked!
I was beaten!'
Hammel said he noticed when the boy came on the air.
"I'll call everyone out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transferred to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is admitted to a critical state.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press round that they had divided a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
The officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the United Kingdom beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty corridors similar to those of the large stores full of expert assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the beauty market in the United Kingdom, which amounts to £2,800 million and which continues to grow as fashionable sales and home products fall, the biggest halls with beauty products will be tested in 11 tents all over the country, and will then pass to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets seek to fill up the shelves that day occupied televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products until it reached 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those you can see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique makeup so that most products are suitable for vegans, something more and more demanded by the younger clientele.
Besides, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will try concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, while the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small shops means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that the establishments will more and more look like shopping centers, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount shops like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced sales points from Argos and Habitat in hundreds of shops, as it has bought the two chains two years ago. By the way, this has reinforced the sales of edibles and yielded the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's put in place a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but association came to an end after a dispute about how to share pharmacy revenues in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business made up of 281 shops in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, "We have transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff that you can turn to for advice.
Our product range is designed to adjust to all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old buying habits."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby retires from business of 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, went "furious" after the television host Holly Willoughby had withdrawn from an 11 million-pound business with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of household clothes and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Ptroew.
37-year-old presenter of this Morning used Instagram to announce his farewell.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons' Den Star, Peter Jones blinking when he retired from his lifestyle brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "furicious" when the golden girl on television admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new businesses, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that he no longer had time to dedicate to the brand of household clothes and accessories of both, Truly.
The business came to compare itself with Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Pltorow, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby went to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones took an airplane to Britain and headed to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was quite different from one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left acquitted all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this Morning's presenter is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, because of the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes and textiles to home, and that could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friend with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joins as president in March.
The couples were together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as the host in the ITV I'm program to Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "We shouldn't talk about his business."
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He took the criticisms he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not a president's own" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said by putting his voice on "telephone presenter."
"I didn't give in."
He pointed out that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in June in Singapore, which Trump sees as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three pesos after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat Ri Yong Ho, reported to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, it has highlighted, the US continues to impose sanctions directed to continue to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his rally speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"Let's go to war with North Korea.
They would have killed millions of people.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: finishing up with missile tests, helping freeing the hostages and returning home to the remaining U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we'd have about 200 people standing here," Trump said pointing to the crowd he had just ahead.
A earthquake and tsunami ravages an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental foreign organizations were informed that they didn't need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they will not seek international help, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency, has made sure that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly enduring, the country is extremely ill-equipped to deal with the anger of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis were built in Aceh, it's not common to find them on the other side.
Even though an alert had been issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travelling among many of the islands of Indonesia presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign turned around the deterioration of Indonesia's infrastructures, and made money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration is affected by a large lack of funds in the final line at the re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of most Muslims have adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the confrontation in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge marks the goal of the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat at the Premier League in Chelsea with a goal on the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri being still about 27 meters from Chelsea's port office with his team losing 1-0.
He played the ball with his left leg before he shot the second pole.
The balloon circled over the area as it moved towards the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling over an Arrizabalaga Kepa who jumped into the air and entered the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible," said Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"They came to Kante and gave a touch without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Azuis's head passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning around near the middle of change and running into the Liverpool field..
Kovacic made a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful pass in depth leading Hazard towards the area.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up in the second pole marking with a bullet with the finger that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool is facing Naples at the Champions League stage on Wednesday afternoon at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do its own with Videoton in UEFA Europe League Thursday at 3 pm in London.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunami is up to 832
The number of people killed in the earthquake and tsunami of Indonesia rose to 832, secondly reported on Sunday morning the national disaster management agency.
Many people would be trapped among the debris of the buildings that came below the magnitude earthquake 7.5 happened on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, as indicated in a press round the spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the ruined buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old suspect of murder after a woman had been stabbed to death
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gunshot wounds on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old suspected man of murder.
The police asked people in the area to come or hear something of that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I'd like to make a call to get in touch with us whoever was near John Street in Birkenhead saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to capture anything from the camera in the control panel that would contact us, as they could have key information for our research.
A spokesperson from the police confirmed that the body found belongs to a neighbour of Birkenhead and found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where they found that morning.
The investigation continues as the police say it's in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that they didn't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what happened.
Residents just know they can't get back in within hours.
A police officer has been heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
A woman crying appears on stage.
It doesn't stop saying "it's awful."
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon watching the block of apartments.
Everyone who has information, you are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, who calls 101 or who anonymously contacts Crimestoppers on phone number 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle by "rewrite history"
His prohibition would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by his fanatic and Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disappear" and "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, President of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure located outside Westminster Palace became objective.
The iconoclasty of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed Cromwell wrong by the actions of their grandfather Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion that existed in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to be still deserving of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, was the monarchy.
Whether or not that is a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the 17th-century conflict has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A pig killer smashes a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and murdered a farmer in a South West China market.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the surname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered with blood near a courtroom in the Liupanshui market, in Guizhou province.
A pig breeder prepares to put the vaccines to the pigs in a bark on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that she had traveled with her cousin Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him another adjacent bark.
He said there was a big male with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he was killed.
"My cousin had his legs bloody and torn apart," declared the cousin, named "Wu," to Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera recording shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed her pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market director told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police had gathered evidence on stage.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Even though they're not very common, there's already been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kilos rushed a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs don't usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "disparaging."
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong, widespread rains to the southwest of the United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico flow over.
However, Rosa will take torrential rains north of Mexico and southwest of the U.S. during the next few days.
On Sunday morning 5 o'clock east, Rosa was a category 1 hurricane with winds of over 135 km/h and was located about 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move toward the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a fence begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and to move east, towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, he will begin to push tropical humidity toward the north, which will penetrate the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the valve will create abundant and widespread rains in the southwest in the next few days.
At the local level, the precipitation of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and the possibility of land spills in the desert.
The great tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in punctual areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest are expected from 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain, especially on much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of rain.
We strongly counsel to venture into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rains could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and the electric storms will bring localized winds and dust.
The fence will bring local rains to the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which could in turn cause flow of smaller debris and slippery roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet station in the region.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain extends at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The abundant rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will testify to large temperature fluctuations in the US due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes implies important temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country a warm October start is expected, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach the 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates great probability of temperatures above average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw the trial at Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual programming for a new last hour of Friday: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona, Jeff Flake, to have the FBI carry out an investigation of one week's charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh played them when he was drunk and tried to get his clothes off a party in high school.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said it was totally certain that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that over 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company counted the average audience at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that retransmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To get an idea, it's an audience similar to an end of football or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, who has largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement indicating that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being stabbed by demonstrators when he tried to enter an elevator on his way to the court hearing.
He remained with his gaze low for several minutes while he was reprimanded, television live on CNN.
"I'm here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
They said, "You have power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said that her office made a Flake statement, before the elevator was closed, she added that she would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable channels were broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment before the Senate to put the vote in.
But Flake said it would only do that if the FBI were to investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which called for a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced of the conversations with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and prejudice national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the cover of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers Plan for Brexit by saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise the tariffs on the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murdered: the police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect from shooting the lives of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, Louisiana State University.
According to the Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned by a second-degree murder charge.
The officers broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the scene and claimed that they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS's affiliate, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said they admitted to being the gunman who killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he was charged with a bail of $350,000.
The Office of the Forensics of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the running unit of the state police in Louisiana, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police are the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their "diligence and seeking justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 wing was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball trainer Will Wade said the team was "strike down" and "threated" by Wayde's death.
"This is what concerns us all the time," said Wade.
Volcano asian rice on Mexico City
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano on Saturday after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring various strongs and tremors.
The images of social networks showed fine layers of ashes in the windshields of Mexico City as Xochimilco neighborhoods.
The geophysicals detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude earthquake 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflict between the police and the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the Independence Referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after Pro-Independence protesters faced the riot police and as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the Catalan secession.
A group of masked proseparatists contained by police anti-disturbing  Guindolos eggs and po-painting that created dark dust clouds in the streets that tend to be filled with tourists.
There were also later colds that same day with the police, who used the poops to hold the fight.
For several hours, pro-independant groups who co-created "Ni oblivion or forgiveness" faced unionist protesters shouting "Long live to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for mild wounds received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues to bloom in the independentist region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although it is considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters chose suffocatingly for independence, although participation was low and the opposites to secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at the polling stations throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who came to the independent demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I've seen my parents cry for joy when I can vote, but now we're dead," he said.
Despite obtaining an adjusted victory, though decisive, in the regional elections of last December, this year the Catalan pro-independent parties fought to maintain the momentum, with many of their leaders most well known in self-imposed exile or detained in waiting for trial for their participation in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his cell phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians from both sides.
"Every time there's more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that the following year would be presented to the elections to the European Parliament.
"Presenting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he assured.
Londonderry: Arrest a man after a car hit a house
three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car had been hitchhiking on several occasions against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (winter time in Britain).
Police investigation inspector Bob Blemmings declared the grid and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible that you shot a bandage against the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston the 1-0 victory over the Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston ended in victory
Livingston's promotion surprised the Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as a coach at the Hebox club.
The goal of Dolly Menga was decisive for Gary Holt's team to climb a level by placing it after Hibernian, in second position.
Gerrard's team keeps singing out of the house this year at the Premiership and next Sunday they're dealing with the leader, Hearts, of which they're separated by eight points.
But the Rangers will first receive the Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to be invicted in the division by sixth consecutive match; the main coach, Holt, is not yet aware of defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler with me.
Livingston lets escape opportunities against disabled visitors
Holt's team must have moved forward long before the moment they scored, because with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his cross shot did not cross the threshold of the port; then Alan Lithgow's shot went out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the port.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors in danger of playing the ball stopped.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston made a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who touched the balloon and scored from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated possession but struck with an impenetrable defense that avoided much work for the Liam Kelly ranger.
That boss went on in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
The Rangers' bodyguard, Allan McGregor took a shot at Scott Pittman's weight, and Lithgow threw the ball out in another game at Livingston's stopped ball.
There were many crossings in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two requests for penalty were rejected: one by hand and one by one for Halkett's entry to replacement Glenn Middleton.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from stadium Tony Macaroni
A spectacular performance and result for Livingston.
And united, they were excellent and continue to overcome expectations in their ascending trajectory.
His game style and players have only changed since he returned to the highest category, but part of the merit is Holt by the way he pushed the team from his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, led a superbly organized defense while Menga didn't give them a breath throughout the party to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on times under Gerrard's orders, they didn't reach that level on this occasion.
They failed the last pass, they only managed to penetrate the host team once, all of which was an advance call to the Rangers, which was found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29 there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which seeks to repair the relationship between NATO's allies.
They disagreed on many matters, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan approached to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocratized by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when colliding with a car
A cyclist died in a collision where a car was surrounded in London.
The accident took place near the crossing between the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a street passed from Deptford, in the south-west of the city, around 10:15 a.m. (summer time in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident took place months after another cyclist died on a runaway hitch on Childers Street a little over a mile from the Saturday crash.
The metropolitan police indicated that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and the drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers are injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security altercation in prison, according to the prison officer.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30 a.m. (Summer Time in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which eight prisoners are involved who are contained in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for mild injuries on their face.
A spokesperson from the prison service said: "The staff of specially trained prisons have been deployed to deal with an ongoing HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six staff members had to be assisted by injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we're clear that those responsible will be delivered to the police and could spend more time among the fences."
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was known that the director of the prison facility had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, anti-disturbing officers had to come to prison to calm down a revolt in which the staff was assaulted with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the places affected by the drought could benefit)
It's rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it's very likely that it will occur early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa passes through the Desert of the Southeast, leaving chance of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Mondays and Tuesdays of Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and to arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service reported in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended on a 64-mile radius of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service provide 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 in the edge of Arizona Mogollón.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky and the Great Conca could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with totals being isolated by 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, for the region is very affected by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southeast is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme dry, the second largest category," saidweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit land on the Low California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north to 19 km/h.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason it is expected that land will be played in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday night.
It could rain with a lot of intensity in some parts of Mexico, assuming an important risk of flooding.
"The total precipitation of between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora is expected, and it is possible to meet up to 250 l/m2", reportsweather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then he will continue to climb across Arizona and enter the south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or the rest of his sleep is heavy precipitation in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and in the U.S. Southwest Desert," the National Center of Hurricanes reported.
These rains are expected to cause sudden waterfalls and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides on mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton aggression: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder so much to find a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 04:00 (winter hours in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains stable.
According to Somerset's police, three boys, 17, 18 and 20 years old, were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on his cell phone.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh "suffered the mesquinity and cholera" of the Democratic Party
"To vote for judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a rally at Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh "suffered the mesquinity and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its process of appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he denied categorically and emotionally the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified in the judgment on his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that day the "Americans" were witnesses of Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best journalists of our time with an unpopular public service record," he said addressing the multitude of admirers of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of Republican results in half-term elections.
"It takes five weeks for some of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't have to, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the task of the Democrats is to "oppose and hinder."
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place before Friday, as CNN indicated an assistant to the Republican Party.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami are causing hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke into the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke down on the ground to the luscofusco, leading the lives of many and destroying everything at its pace.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"Today, when the threat came, people were still with their activities on the beach and didn't run away immediately, so they died," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a prison round in Iacarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trunks, house, dragged everything I could find," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
They evacuated around 16,700 people to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs disseminated by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many tents and destroyed buildings, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued shaking the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the massive earthquake of Friday was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the end of a long, narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantious" and said that thousands of homes, shopping centers and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the rubble of the demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the north coast of Palu, an area called Dogalea and which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely paralyzed and there's no information" from Domigaa, Nugroho added.
There are over 300,000 people living there," reported the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he declared.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, even though officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In an amateur tape shared on social media, you can listen to a man who is on the top floor of a building shout franticly warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people in the street.
Within minutes the water hits the shoreline driving buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an important blackout that caused the cutout of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
The authorities state that the army has already begun to ship cargo aircraft from Iacarta and other cities, but the evacuated continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned to visit the evacuation centers of Palu on Sunday.
The balance of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
On the way to the World Vision staff to get to the city of Palu, where the employees rescue themselves in canvas shelters lifted up in the courtyard of their office, they watched scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba commented.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when groups began the unpleasant task of launching assistance in the event of disasters, some complained that they were preventing them from travelling to Palu to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staff from foreign countries can only flow if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arrani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open up to international assistance, but it's not yet that moment."
By falling the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Fridays, family members and friends of the disappeared were clinging to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that would remove the depressing argument of natural disasters."
On Saturday they pulled out a boy from a sink.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandon, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliding players for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandage added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As a person with wide experience in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon related how, in the hours following the spread of the news of the overthrow of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community, he desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival
However, messages only showed a gray mark instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered," he added.
They steal $26,750 while charging a cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
In the press release, researcher officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a box in the leisure complex and prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole him a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the scene, but the police did not realize how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, please contact the Newport police by calling 859-292-3680.
Rapier Kanye West changes his name by the name of Ye
Rapier Kanye West changed his name for Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being first known as Kanye West."
For some time now, 41-year-old West has been known for the name Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change took place before it appeared on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled his assistance with "emotional motivations", according to the program creator.
In addition to being a abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti',' said that same year West while talking about his record with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was first known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced he prefers to call him Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, also caught himself by putting the script out and using the upper case.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has committed not to use military force against civilians again when the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students is approaching.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he "would not use the military again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support the Mexican youth by providing monthly help to the boys who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities lead boys to crime gangs.
U.S. should double the investment in I.A.
According to the investor and professional IA Kai-Fu Lee, former Google, Microsoft and Apple, U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even if the U.S. lack a formal strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be the number 1 innovation in AI in 2030.
"Duplicate budgeting in research on AI would be a good start, since the other countries are far behind than the US, and we are looking for the next big advance on AI," Lee said.
Double funding could double the odds that the next IA achievement was made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is general director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon's university, he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player with the highest score and was later CEO in Microsoft Research of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions as the robotic rete of the Advanced Defense Research Project Agency and asked when he would be the next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to obtain government scholarships, says Lee.
"China is not the one leading academic leaders, but the companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. to boost its efforts in AI.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in AI," he said.
The State Council of China published its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding to individuals from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, you currently invest more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the American legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence did not record a movement for months.
The Macedonians vote in referendum if they change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wished to change their name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece and that would block applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that change would prejudice the ethnic identity of most of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the outcome would reach the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum paper was, "Is it in favour of NATO and the EU accepting the agreement with Greece?"
The name-change defenders, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying to get admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have voted for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of Members of Parliament have said that they would undermine the result of the vote and make it final.
The change of nine would require a majority of two-thirds of parliament.
The state election commission stated that no irregularity was recorded at 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters deposited their vote.
"I'm going to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko deposited their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of the country's name that would open the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads up and not through the service door," added Kavarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will bring the much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entering the EU and NATO," Zaev commented after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the requirement.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian Telma TV station indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he'd vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since it had access to power in May of the past.
View: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses all Brighton's defense and ends up scoreling a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling reported on Brighton's defense with 2-0 Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple to mark the 65th minute goal.
The Argentinian front received a step in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading to the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
You've defied a defense before you've crossed multiples on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English frontman used the first touch area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton Mathew Ryan's bodyguard with a shot at the right of the network.
"Aguero is going through some problems on his feet," said the coach of the City, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky that he marked at that time."
But Sterling gave the blues the initial advantage in the confrontation of the Premier League.
That goal arrived in the 29th minute.
I now received the ball in the depth of Brighton's field in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass through the hall on the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite post.
The tiles put the ball in the trunk before leaving the camp.
The city will be facing Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. on Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals out of the struggle for elimination, there were not many reasons to force another title.
But a competitive Scherzer always hopes to launch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still implications for the elimination for the Rockies, which bring a game of advantage to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies have secured at least one position of the wild with the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still try to close their first division title.
"Even if we don't play anything, at least we can touch the gum knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I played this year.
Why don't I want to compete on that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the opener will be on Sunday, but they seem to be suggesting that Scherzer is what he throws into a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his start number 34, made another session of bullpen on Thursday and will probably throw on Sunday on his usual day of rest.
The right hand of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this time.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the electorate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of the outcome in the half-term election.
"We played everything we did in November.
It's been five weeks for some of the most important choices in our lives.
This is a big, big thing, I don't have to do, but I really do do it, and that's why I'm going all the way fighting for big candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You've seen this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what's happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, evil, and petty.
They don't care who they hurt, above who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we're never gonna give it to him."
The task of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder."
"And you've seen that in the past four days," he said, qualifying the Democrats for "annoyed, valved, disgusting and liars."
He enumerated the Senate Judicial Committee quoting Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong applause from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Have you filtered the document?
Mmm. Well, what?
No, mmm, no, wait, it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who are not well received, and all by saying our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because he faced a decisive challenge to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, by chance, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For the most part of the eight years I've been a Labour MP, the meetings of Friday night's committee were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has been forgotten a long time ago, if it has ever begun.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, when fellows who believed he shared a similar political vision began to expect me to be portrayed and adopted positions that I would never agree with, whether in terms of national security as the single EU market.
When I speak publicly, and actually of the kind I say, there's a tremendous noise and attacks on social networks censoring central politics, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of fellows who face a torrent of sexists or racists every day and who don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how insult levels have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every "untrust" movement or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower in its gaze.
Over the past few years, I have received a lot of advice that urges me to keep my head down, not to be so frank and that then "all would go well for me."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there are 32 still in school, led by the neglect of the government of Thatcher who literally let my class fall, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both being local concierge as the minister of the government.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused with my political stances and that I do not agree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted the Friday motion, the only thing I'd say is that while the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy by questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invict Ayr gets in the head
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little, but no doubt the Ayr deserved to win this fine party of the Premier League of Tenent.
Now they lead the table and it's the only invicto team of ten.
Finally, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk of risk, that the team took him to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we've been tested in our parties and we're still invicts, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "You have to admit that Ayr has taken better chances than we have."
The essay in the 14th minute of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put in front of the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the party by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot got a wrong pitch.
Click increased the advantage for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, turned a shot into a solo, leaving the marker 17-5 in favour of Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop by the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which left the camp in a paudiola and, since the re-initiation, Ayr has advanced more through a Stafford McDowall trial, transformed by Climo.
The captain in functions of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took part in having one more player with an unconsumed Bruce Colvine essay, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
However, the local team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for plating Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson marked an essay from the penal line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo marked, as he did almost since the start, after Kyle Rowe collected the launch in the David Armstrong area and had sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth essay from the local team.
Still Game protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to join the restoration industry after finding out he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, who writes and co-protagonizes with his old partner Greg Hemhill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final one, and it seems that Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, even though a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's next restaurant business.
'The sea is ours': the interior Bolivia expects the court to walk the Pacific
The sailors watched a naval thirst covered with appliances in La Paz.
The public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonas are added to the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It's a duty to recover it."
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict continues to live, just as the desire to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes are at their peak in decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course awaits a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see CIX's sentence on giant screens all over the country in the hope that the Hague Court will speak in favour of Bolivia's complaint and that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile will be forced to negotiate the concession of Bolivia from a sovereign sea escape.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic Indian president, who was facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts find it unlikely that the court would justify Bolivia, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory, and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that the CIX sentence comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," states Chilean expert in international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years could have delayed it.
"The theme of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate says.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have had no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken an unusually quick decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, even one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using this subject for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can be trusted in the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong states that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment takes place at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart stagnated nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri claims it's "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration ending the Korean War can double the North.
In Washington they refuse to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second cumio Kim-Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the shops.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or if you want to hide completely from the sun, do not look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the sidewalk a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that enthralled the public in the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers pull their most surprising creations out of the gateway.
Valentino's main piece was an over-whelmed bee hat adorned with a wide shawl imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large-sized accessories there were dried sandstones, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewed and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete dive team, with glasses and tube, and other a melt ice cone.
And if you're a fan of the huge fashion, you're lucky.
The fashionable understood predicted that giant caps could reach the shops.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomb", the straw hat with a six-inch blade that takes everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has taken to the gateway another great creation: a beach bag of straw almost as large as the model attached with a bathing suit that carries it.
The orange flair bag adorned with ravine flakes and finished with a white leather wing, was the highlight piece of the spring 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera on Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I hope the hats and big beach bags arrive at the shops next summer, since the designer had such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories'.
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for the citizens of the world
The private schools in Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the highest level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, he knocks it over his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he'll reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and at the highest approved rates in private schools.
About 68% of students who studied foreign languages got an outstanding one.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up SCIS, shows that 72% of students obtained an honorary registration in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of them who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding one.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
At present, languages are having the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all kinds of school programs.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that among the lack of knowledge of languages is 17% of the reasons why employers are charged with filling their vacancies.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare youth for future careers.
These abilities are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% didn't speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others are based on languages considered most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what their children's interests are, private schools always have several languages to choose and specialized teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future tells them.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of private schools.
Lebron debuts with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the evenings that want to see LeBron James playing with Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Team coach, like Walton, announced that James will play the initial pre-time game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be decided how many minutes he'll play.
"It'll be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After early week training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers matches.
At this point in my career I don't need early matches to be ready," he said.
Trump's electoral acts arrive in Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump's 5 scheduled matches for the next week, including stops in cities near him like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a standing confirmation vote for your candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump seeks support for the next half-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today on Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's rally in West Virginia to follow via live stream via YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with the subject of the trial held this week to the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who keeps the Senate's confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of riots is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new impulse.
So these five myths that Trump will give next week have as their goal "to dynamize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to your schedule that the president will travel to as many states as possible towards the campaign season," said Reuters, a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be appointed.
The rally tonight, which will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together the supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage of the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate of West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politologist from the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive to individual parties on Sunday
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon's ansome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse oscillating pendulum is a fully invented sport concept but in what sportsmen really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I suppose we're taking that as a little boost," said Jordan Spieth as he was leaving at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of benefit with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a bit of wind in favor and much so to cheer up, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each account with three points of four.
Spieth was lethal from tea to green and is preaching with the example.
Those guptal screams were made stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie up the fourth match when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
When he got the putt that made them win the match in 15, he made a similar scream, the kind of scream that said he thinks the U.S. team isn't still out.
"You just have to focus and worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's the only thing that's left of these players now.
18 holes to get stuck.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of four and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way it seems to flow its energy into the crowd and from it, confirms them how the rivals beat on Sunday, and there could not be more popular players to get a victory when the sun was set over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio García, the furball hero of the morning, when he paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended up with Spanish and Swedish in a hole of which they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there won't be anyone to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the way they can change a strategy at once.
Europe has played better as a team until now and they have a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has a hard fight, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has an advantage of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and the foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty to climb four points to the scoreboard in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who seeks to preserve the trophy that they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the ants, winning four matches, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points of the four initial games in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the forballs, they fit perfectly to defeat a despicable Woods and the American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who fought two parties on Saturday without penalty or glory, showed occasional bursts of brightness, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in the modalities of fourballs and foursomes and five followed.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the forts of the morning, rejoined his partner Henrik Stenson in the ants, getting a defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three in the world.
Europe couldn't always win on a pleasant breeze day in the southwest of Paris.
The three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the point of reference for the Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and won Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes again after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in Ryder Cup's story where a team climbed up four points in the individual, although as the current trophy holder, Furyk's team only needs to tie up to preserve it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Cora says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased his mistrust in the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong This told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures to show its goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, dismantleing nuclear testing camps and committing itself to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't see the response from the US," he added.
"Without confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part."
As Ri resumed the already known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, its statement seemed important, since it did not refuse unilateral denuclearization as it had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump on the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has been looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective of coercive action, and even if they oppose the "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned in the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "bad president" Trump called Kim "a man rocket on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage in taking steps to disarmament, but said that there is still a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday Trump said there was no time limit for that, and that "it's like it takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, however, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: "The fulfilment of the Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe the total, final and verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would come back to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had moved forward, just a few hours after North Korea had denounced him for making "mafia-like demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took the "corresponding measures".
He signaled that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he requested were the security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all your students sleep more in order to fight the growth of machist culture from studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar found that students at university number one in the world often don't know the basic aspects of how to take care of them.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Muller, took the course, which he believes is the first of this kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact the lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course a girl came up and said to me, 'Why do you only tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said that no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," commented The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour of duration involves a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sleep deficit affects the athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are informed of how the lack of long sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what health effects they are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend all night awake still exists, and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who involved lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that he sleeps long enough and that he has a good quality sleep must be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, points out. Even avoiding weight loss, since lack of sleep causes the brain to get in mode of inannation, which keeps him constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course across the campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to lie down as well as when they wake up. However, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: the goal of Menga overthrows Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Hebox team intended to record their first victory at home since the 4-1 victory in February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team led to Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left his team at eight points of Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a tributary of the Rangers with little inspiration never gave the feeling that it was tie up.
While the Rangers went down to the sixth post, Livingston went up to the third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had had to have dealt with by a wound in the head after the supposed launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that dragged Ayr into the semi-finals of Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 Livingston who drew a point to Hearts last week and would have been delighted at the way his group organized his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They may have marked in just two minutes when the short passage of the first time of Menga sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's port office, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot of Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him to the second pole.
The Rangers took over, but they seemed to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
No doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt they should have pitted punishment at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless hit, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers had only two shots at the door in the first half, but the old man of Hebox, Liam Kelly, had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head ending and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed once again in the face of Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher placed the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the blood cold to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at rest when he switched to Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the finger made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued devouring visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long balloon after another.
Holt's team might have extended the advantage at the end of the day, but McGregor stood up perfectly to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another criminality by flirting with Jacobs, but Thomson made his eyes fat again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and CONTACT... was the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pear of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactive activity of minerals."
Evans: "Say, it's crashing now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
They can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovaries cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "impresses the growth of various types of cancer", including those of breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "testinals" to addressing cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump using a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) after his appearance in the program Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result wasn't good.
During a Saturday Night Live program, Kanye West was stabbed in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After interpreting the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If I were worried about racism, I would have been out of the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the program with a satire star played by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star was mocking Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the U.S. Senate's Judicial Committee on the sexual assault demands made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it hasn't been released, Chris Rock has gone up the images of West's criticism on social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had spent a bad time in the behind bars because of his hat.
"They passed with me on the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was going to pick myself up," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pick?" saying that would "use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do." You want the world to move forward?
Test with love."
His comments provoked abrupt at least twice in the audience and the members of the SNL list seemed to be embarrassed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "All the study was silent absolute."
They had appointed West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many perplexed people with an interpretation of the song I love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West obtained the support of the TPUSA Conservative Group leader, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: GRAZAS FOR FRONT MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was just "being who it is and that's completely wonderful."
"So and so on, I chose to NOT reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "the being officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The young Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder by stabilising at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Maxistrades Court or Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
The Star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword management role as Jon Snow in HBO Game of Thrones' violent medieval series.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a machist hero, saying that these roles on the screen are translated into what it seems that young people often have to be hard to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era (#EuTamén).
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she felt "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Persually, I feel pretty strong at this moment, when we're wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, clearly, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he won't do any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, claiming that "bath of horses and battlefields".
From November, Kit will lead a true West (the true west) replacement of Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he thought his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this program, so, in a way, she provided me with my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects over 820,000 people in the country, the health authorities have declared.
Forty thousand new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in the interim, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters mocks that a staff member leaked data from the Republican Party Senators, "dangerous minds" and "conspirator theories"
On Saturday, the US representative, Maxine Waters, denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators of the U.S. Republican Party on Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultrarighte".
"Lives, lies and more infamous lies," Waters commented in a statement on Twitter.
According to it, the disseminated information included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a Waters staff member, reported Capitol Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, has not been responsible in any way for the filtration of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie."
Waters' statement immediately aroused online criticism, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This untrue man became angry," wrote Fleischer.
"It makes sense that he has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he hasn't done, he mustn't get angry.
It should not be challenging.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
You must remain arable and serene."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction with the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to unload Waters in the middle term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it was true" shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that his department warned "the law enforcement authorities and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent accusations.
"We will make sure we discover the guilty," he continued, "so that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and every member of my team."
Johnny English Strikes Again in Action, the powerless spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can apply to the return of this parody's franchise and Johnny English action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire become about the issue of the evidently stupid that we are in the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny English's incompetent eye and rubber character renewed his license to ruin things for the second time, his name is already a clear indication that it's a general comical creation designed for non-English cinematographic territories.
Of course, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his extrafalous claims of adulation glamor, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a piece of that type that contributed with a single note on the topic of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of London 2012 Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once interpreted the now forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, in which he sowed chaos in his footsteps.
There's a couple of good moments at Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval armor suit and the rotor's steps make a brief crash against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy comes to the fore, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when these "serious" movies, like 007 and Impossible Mission, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed at children, instead of adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misfortunes are not as clever or concentrated as Atkinson's film jokes change by incarnating Bean's character.
Now the constantly topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates Britain's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, for the distress of the agent on duty, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the top for a pomposous and conflicting prime minister, who has already suffered a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisors are not aware that as all the spies on the move have been engaged, someone must be removed from the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but he gives extra-official lessons about how he becomes an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the academy of spies to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with their old and suffering fellow Bough, reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, a enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batmans and Robin of the mistakes of His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, sticking to Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fatal wife, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in a dangerous way succumbing to the charm of the multimillion technological charismatic that claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hatred of ridiculous falcatruades: barbarian costumes, set fire to a hostile French restaurant; create a riot that illegally puts them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English causes total anarchy when trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize itself with the inside of the home of Volta.
Of course, all arrests come out of this last sequence, but in a kind and scandalous way it is, it seems pulled out of a child's television program.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help thinking: Can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it's drawing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but they cover for five.
The party allegedly wants entrepreneurs to spend their savings through the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) offering workers an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would be "adjusted" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The Trade Union Congress supported the four-day rounds a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party's focus to balance the economy for the worker, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
Nevertheless, the Labour Party today does not support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "A four-day working week does not enter the party policy and is not being considered by this party."
The shadow chancer, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr.McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also imply the possibility that current water company shareholders do not recover all their investment, as a labourer government could perform "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company councils and to create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private-sector shares to employees, who embolish annual dividends for up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy count on "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least one week the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court, the question being raised as to whether the findings of the department could influence the Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, at an interview, the reporter of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring them to light something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd go to the audience, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusation came out and asked him if he had.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems unmovable.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is decided and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett suddenly denied it," added Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't check it out.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star signpost that will act and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people come in command to Central Park's Great Lawn area, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event of ending poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively combat it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the 12-year Global Citizen to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a great way to persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of the so-called "clickivism", people who think it makes a difference when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, pushing a set of different goals.
He claims these actions helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK company of investors and executives who have committed to "help children develop to their maximum potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, the donors, the national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history," said the multitude of Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied, "It will be a long and difficult way and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way that happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will play this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furnessss and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to make a "block" to hinder Russia's energy exports, the US Interior Secretary announced
"In case it is necessary," Washington may resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, it has revealed U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did it in Eastern Europe," she said, as she reports.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, along with the navy, to ensure that seaways are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called itself the "power consumer's voice" in the USA.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, taking into account that in practice it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying that "it has only a tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow's "cative".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream pipeline 2 of $11 billion, which was established to double the existing pipeline capacity at 110 billion cubic metres, is a mere economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following the meeting with the US Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, which took place in September in Moscow.
The US position got Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry's leading organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI, by its German acronyms), called on the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, following a recent meeting between German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine his presidential candidacy in 2020, said Senator of Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said he would carefully examine his candidacy for the presidency after the medium term elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the government fracture and that includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency."
Warren thought about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, claiming that he was "raising this country by the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it has been shown that most of Warren's own voters do not believe that it will be presented in 2020.
Fifty percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator would not file her candidacy, according to the survey by the University of Suffolk's Political Research Centre and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the former governor's candidacy, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other outstanding names of the Democrats in relation to a possible candidacy in 2020 include the former vice president, Joe Biden, and Senator de Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially before January, he informed the agency Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes from Donald Trump's Non-Mitin Track Palin post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT)
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, they were arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence.
"With what my own son is going through, with what's happening again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of TEPT and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," he explained to the audience at a rally by Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo issue and that his son and other war veterans, "turned different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what the fellow militiamen and aviators, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
They were arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while it was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the Columbia District challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a judicial remedy in relation to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, the representatives of 18 states and the district presented a court friendly report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, informed NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff part of Grace Sessions v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Union for Civil Liberties) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and her sons members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but the U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers in the states that support Grace described O Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations that face generalized problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation.
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assisted in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle" was explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants is damaging to the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide labor."
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who escape domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
"Accommodation is available for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions declared in its political announcement on 11 June.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all problems (including all serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby at the evacuation center of Palu's devastated city.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their former belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured the back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I believe," said Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was on a wedding in the city.
"I listened to my wife asking for help and then, just silent.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of abusing "propagandistic announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper begging for the benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, made reference to the Chinese Daily payment supplement on Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of joining the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, as China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to enter the U.S. elections marked what the officials of that country coined in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war, witnessing the leveling of tariffs in their respective imports.
According to the experts from China and the USA, China's compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of China's leading exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing harmed workers, farmers and American entrepreneurs.
In an opinion paper written by Branstad and published in the issue of the Moines Register, China "is intensifying this harassment campaign by spreading propaganda advertisements in the free US press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the beloved American tradition of freedom of expression and the press by publishing a payment announcement at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the post of newspapers located at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissenting voices and there is no real reflection of the sharp opinions that the Chinese may have on the worrying economic trajectory of China, since the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he states that "one of China's most important journals has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he has not confirmed what the newspaper is.
Kavanaugh's disaster makes women's Republican vote lost within a few days of half-term elections.
Although many of the leading Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various charges of sexual assaults, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially female voters, in the next half-term election.
The reactions to these accusations were numerous and most Republicans were positioned to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," assured Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell's school at Syracuse University in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that it is doubtful that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation is enough to calm the spirits of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget in the near future or in November," he reflected on Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, the lead advisor and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, to the flu of "Accommodation November!", appeared in the Senate hall, while the Republicans, with the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, informed Mic.
"Democratic motivation and enthusiasm will overcome any expectation," he assured the site of reports Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It's true that it's already high,
but it's still going to be more, especially among the indecisive voters women in the neighborhoods or those between 18 and 29 years of age, who, although they don't like the President, don't usually come to the polls."
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that it was possible to have a violent reaction if the Republicans kept on with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the committee's vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the accused's bank or not, the problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of priorities USA, a group that helps the Democrat election on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing the testimony of Ford or that of Kavanaugh, even though they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents believe in full or probably the testimony of Ford, compared to 35% supporting the witness of Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30% who thinks the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations, as well as those of at least another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate's Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of horror when she was 17.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a university party when he was studying at Yale in the '80s.
World Wide Web creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was lucky that the intention to hide Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it," he said about startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online personal data storage or POD.
Contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available on a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has full control over who can access what information.
The company qualifies this as a "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to President John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about whether or not entering a complete change that would change his business models from day to day.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has stood up as an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee is still the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new web era," added Berners-Lee.
Honor Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been granted the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were responsible for discovering a memorial monument in his honor in a parade in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, emphasized the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's feat he deserved the title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann headed to his battalion through Saint-Quentin's channel "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense fire from machine guns."
Later he hurried to get to the line of fire and, with "great courage," he led the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and bringing down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson anyway."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put on a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the Brentwood Imperial youth band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genius hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cut the roll to MMA amateurs at the best time
Imagine that you've been awake all night to enjoy Bellator 206's full show, and when the best part comes, something prevents you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 matches, with six mains, and was broadcasting live in the United Kingdom in Channel 5.
But on the 6th of the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see their faces, the United Kingdom viewers were amazed when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some did not impress them after spending so many hours awake waiting to see the fight.
An amateur described the change to these childhood cartoons on Twitter as "a joke of very tasteful."
"State regulations refuse that this content was inappropriate for 6 a.m., and that's why it had to be changed to children's programming," explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Marketing and Bellator's communication, when asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said they'll take UK viewers into account in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think of the repetition," said Coker.
"But if it's 6:00 a.m. there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will already be Monday to them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change came, I started receiving many messages and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll be limited to five fights instead of six, and we want to give our amateurs the most, but we'll go by and
Give us a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he's grown to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Invited by the first broadcast of the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is on sick leave.
As a guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "lower" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked children."
He said, "Even today, that feeling of inferiority and of being different is what pushed me and gave me the strength to achieve success."
I wanted to prove it was "someone" so people wouldn't feel disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a leading LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He decided to talk because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and fearlessly to repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time champion of the world said he was in love with the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was a surprise."
Daley married this winner of an Oscar last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so much in such a short time" (with only 14 years of age you first participated in Olympic Games and your father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who had experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley totally change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are things much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son was tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you I wouldn't be here to fill that first row," Daley shared.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that very moment, at the time of his death, when I realized that it wasn't really invincible," he adds.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that this was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no feeling better" confirmed.
The selection of Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain either, since it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on top.

A Mickelson in low form ended up at Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday.
American Phil Miccelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup party, but he will have to improve his technique so that this doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, remained in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or the foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering up and working to improve his moves.
Although it was never the most necessary of the players, not even at the time of his career, at the age of 48, it does not fit the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the high grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And in case this wasn't enough, Mickelson took on the ninth Sunday match to the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below the beginning of the 12 individual matches, start with a good foot, Miccelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he could not say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he played today, gave me a slap on my shoulder, held my arm, and told me that tomorrow he would be ready," Furyk shared.
"He fully trusted himself.
He's got a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end that's how things are, and so we think they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played on Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual scarf.
Miccelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangible to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with gear and he likes to mess with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see how well the younger players spent with him this week.
He's much more with a good player."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup individuals can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danes debuted in 1997 in a party in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seven Ballesters had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimum advantage winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; as in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by little," Bjorn reflected, in the photo, after seeing the promotion of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 on the Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go everywhere.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the dots are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I won't get tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of its players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we faced the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a partner next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then put your ability as a golfer to the fullest.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, that they get the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
The difference between Bjorn, Jim Furyk, will seek that his players have a better individual performance than their peers, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself has been in the amboss two extremes of those last day's spins, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but ending up as a loser among the European miracle in Medina."
"I remember each of the damn words," he answered when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players forward to the last day.
"We've got 12 important games, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medina.
When you see the impulse goes in one direction, there's a lot of pressure in those middle parties.
We prepared our alignment with this and we put the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the ranking.
"I've decided this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn explained about his selection for the individual.
The new German warship postponed once more
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not reach at least next year due to defective systems and increasing costs, they informed the local media.
The post in service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the flaming frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was adjourned until the first semester of 2019, according to which he communicated a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-bucco missiles, as well as hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to drop the freshest frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continued delays mean that the warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be old-fashioned when they enter service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a builder after the delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind this return, but the German media talked about "Critical weaknesses in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the 7 thousand-ton Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice that the ships of class used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides the defective hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is claimed that it already reaches the amazing amount of EUR 3100 million, compared to the initial EUR 2200 million.
The problems of the newer frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships fit to unload.
The officer claims that this problem is getting bigger and bigger, as the old ships have been removed, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spies the secret life of bats
A new research that is being carried out on a highlands farm in Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to seek food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the bats Pipstrellus pygmaeus and Pipstrellus pipstrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentoniii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Invewe in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An analysis of the sound performed by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what each species is doing.
Then a habitat map will be developed to create a detailed image at the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results show that habitat areas are more important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and the loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and lighting also pose a risk, as well as traps with flies glue, some chemical treatments of building materials and domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not blind,
but because of his night hunting habits, his ears are more useful than his eyes in hunting.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, child inspections and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization also has the only and first reserve of Scottish bats in Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, Estate Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Thrave we have a large area for bats," he says.
"We count on old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to prosper."
Stresses the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks in the properties, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity child can kill up to 400 females and young children, which could exterminate a whole local population.
The bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the organization Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There's still a lot left to learn about bats and, in the case of many species, we don't know how they're going to their populations."
Ronaldo despises rape demands and his lawyers prepare to sue for German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get acquainted with using his name.
Your lawyers will sue German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these charges.
The head of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman 375 000 USD so that he didn't say anything about the incident, published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, 33 years old, took this false news on a live video from his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
"No, not and a thousand times not.
What is said today is false," said the winner of the Golden Ball in the camera five times.
"People want to get to know each other by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by just saying my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy and respectable man," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to sue Der Spiegel for charges, which qualify as "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage by an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After he met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped it annually, according to the documents presented at Clark de Nevada County District Court.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, kneeled down saying he was 99% a knight, but that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that they both had sexual relations with both parties.
Majorga also claims that he went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later he reached out to an extrajudicial agreement because he felt terrified by reprisals and was worried about the public scandal.
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to revoke the agreement while she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian Juve giant in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Automobile manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of its position as a world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, according to the secretary of business Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had stated in the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"It's necessary to reach an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that, in case Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, responsible for manufacturing the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced some 150 000 vehicles last year, from which 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain abandons the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses of how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other U.K. car manufacturers also expressed their fear of abandoning the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his Mini plant at Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain if an agreement is not reached in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is well-adjusted, every 37 minutes are provided by suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for custom-made cars.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and there could be delays and shortages of pieces.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to keep a normal pace more than a day on Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best deal, so that we can enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota could not estimate how long the production would stop, but warned that in the long run, the added costs would reduce plant competition and even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, an employee of Burnaston for 24 years and a union coordinator of the United States, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
One government spokesman said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be reopened
The White House stated that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and the Undersecretary of Rosenstein's justice could be delayed a week longer due to the candidate's struggle for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, links between Russian and Trump assistants, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General, or not, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein talked about using a microphone to record Trump's talks and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among reports that they indicated he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not have to say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was late to avoid a clash with the Senate's judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation to the FBI about the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
In front of the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied, "There's still no fixed date, it could be this week or be a week late, given all that's going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press to be informed."
Some journalists questioned that claim, since Sanders has been in the press since September 10th, without celebrating a press conference.
When introduced Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders stated that the lack of information session was not due to an aversion to the grandeur of reporters, although he added that it will not be she who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not quote any source that would appreciate that data.
They will continue to hold briefings, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that's much better than addressing her questions.
You are witnesses of how we've been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where we can speak directly to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Yet, lonely press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and strange occasions before the journalists gathered.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm down the spirits of Brexit
The Health Secretariat addressed a letter to EU workers in the NHS of Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and expressing its wish to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has committed itself to covering the cost of open status applications for EU citizens working in their decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and it is planned to reach the decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also intensified its preparations for a possible unagreed situation.
I know this is a period of concern to everyone.
That is why I wish to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff member, regardless of his nationality.
The partners in the European Union, and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury during the defeat of Saturday (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's trainer, informed reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
Apparently he passed out when he got to the band line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a shirt to carry out a subsequent evaluation.
A technician from Tennessee State informed Chris Harris, a journalist from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Even so, he added that there are still no details of the type or scope of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when this injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year Red T-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total time to 18th.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This additional money will be used to help homeless people by virtue of the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasure expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May announces that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on people with high income.
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the raised money will be used to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people who sleep on the street.
The charge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second housing and purchase to rent, may be up to 3 %.
Fairy expects the change to be able to collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13% of the new constructions in London are sold by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulty in accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson applied for the application of a cut in the farm tax to help new people acquire their first home.
He accused large builders of keeping high housing prices through the purchase of land and the non-use of land, and urged Mrs May to eliminate tax income percentages on moderate-priced houses to fix the "worship of the housing sector" that lives in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of house-related reform proposals, including the control of renters and the prohibition of evictions in which the lodger is not guilty.
He also wants to grant the highest power councils in building new housings.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it's necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
It's not fair, however, that it's just as easy for those people who don't live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies based on the foreign country, to buy housing than for the British residents who work.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity that it is not supposed to have a roof remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland"
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, said his "last ambition" is to become the Scottish picker at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northwest club, which currently occupies the third square in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played in selection B once, and that was all," said Ross to BBC Scotsong's Sportsound program.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden often with my father when I was a boy, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I'm successful in running a club."
Ross' predecessors in the position of Sunderland's trainer include Dick Advocacy, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims that he felt no concern about the success of those figures so consolidated in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Will success depend on me at this moment if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly the property of a Premier League club," he said.
"It won't turn out to be a simple task to arrive, but it's likely to only consider that I've achieved success here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross has only been a trainer for three years after a period of assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the Hearts technical staff.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St Mirren to come down to win the title of the Championship at the next season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than he has ever been during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was probably at a real crossroads," she recalled, about taking charge of the Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange because it wasn't wrong for me, I've reasonably won life and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I keep suffering from stress and pressure, but I like to train.
I've always liked to train and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30 on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British Summer Time)
According to a survey, the perfect time to take a paint is 5:30 a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in the British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on the chain of restaurants.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent increase during July, but consumption in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of CGA's trade council, who was responsible for compiling the figures, said: "Sundays and England's stay in the world of football for longer than expected caused it to be a pattern similar to that of June, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The 1.8 percent drop in the turnover of restaurants during June worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in beverages were the best results obtained with higher consumption increases than reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specialized in meals also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In controlled pubs and bars the consumption of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and that of meals was reduced by three percent."
Paul Newman, an employee of the RSM company for analysis of leisure and hospitality activities, said: "These results assume a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 per cent annually will be particularly painful if this adds to the continuous increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have come at a worse time for the restoration business and the time will be in charge of saying whether the moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the much-needed breath for the sector."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator from the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with joint benefits of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector's benchmark.
One out of five children has secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One out of five children (some only 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers from a survey
A poll conducted at 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "False Insta"
This news has led to an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a "primary" account to show their parents
One in five children (some only 11 years old) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted at 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "False Insta" accounts (referring to the social network for the exchange of photos Instagram).
This news has led to an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they were using a softened "primary" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who took a secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked her to be raped.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's head Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that there are so many teenagers who are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the council of the Scottish athletic federation
Elilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic federation council as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who drive sports to benefit from their wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys an enormous respect within the Scottish community, the United Kingdom and worldwide, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its incorporation into the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I have a lot of enthusiasm to do as an athlete's spokesman and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games, is a total of four Olympic golds and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and until grade.
It was exhausting work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and now I do exercises of axility.
Thank you for the courage messages."
An announcement of a milk extractor in relation to women with cows divides public opinion into networks
A mother's milk extractor company divided public opinion into the networks with an ad comparing lactating mothers to cows that are getting wet.
To announce the release of the so-called "first silent portable milk extractor in the world," Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new milk extractor to the mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay for the cows at the rhythm of a song with lyrics like the following: "Yes, I love myself, but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not drunk, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on, "Woman, girl, I'm feeding babies, girl, girl, I'm mumbling my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, provoked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 playbacks and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that this post reveals the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth," wrote one.
Elvie's milk extractor can quietly be placed inside a parent (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented the following: "Clarically traumatic for the mother and baby.
But yes, why aren't they used to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What an announcement with so little tact."
Other spectators defended the announcement, even one woman said that the song seemed "very funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Pulling my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I've seen it as a joke.
I think it's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement directed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their places of work or in their bathrooms) and feel like "vaces".
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk extractor is completely silent, has neither cables nor tubes and can quietly fit into a motherly holder, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out there while they're extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and executive creative director commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a daring and provocative launch.
In describing the parallelism between women and milk cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges that involve while we demonstrated in an entertaining way and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time that extractor Elvie takes over newspaper headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrant children have silently traveled to a camp at the Texas border
The number of detained emigrants increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively invariable, partly because of the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign godparents to the children.
Traditionally, most of the godfathers were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential fathers and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified to Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested to defend minors without company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are godfathers or who are part of the home of these people are illegally found in the country, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr.Albence.
In order to prosecute children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require one of these to appear in court before it had elapsed one month since its arrest, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the refugees.
Many will appear by videoconference instead of in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely there will be to become anxious or depressed, which can cause violent seizures or escape attempts by the refugees and reports of the system published in recent months.
Lawyers have claimed that these fears increase in centers of greater dimensions than Tornillo, where there is more chance that the symptoms that a child is having a bad time go unnoticed because of its size.
They also added that moving the children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them from the emotional point of view or to say goodbye to friends could lead to trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were illegally found in Syrian soil, with the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
"They must retreat immediately and without conditions," she reported to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clean up all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "out of all illegal foreign presence."
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were given for his return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
"We look to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition takes place to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last great rebel bastion of Idlib allowed continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions would target the Shihadists, including the soldiers on the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The envoy of UN Staffan of Mixture hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draw up a outline of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interferences.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr Trump would be able to re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to their presidency prematurely.
No doubt it would be "The most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of tiredness among the observers.
Since 2014, pre-time audience rates have multiplied by more than two, up to 1.05 million viewers at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in primetime, an increase of 1.7 million compared to four years ago according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC 's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led the audience rates of channels per cable with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when important news occurred.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama for the ABC "Designed Survivor", who deals with a secretary from the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told you he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked him.
"He answered, 'Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's entertainment inside the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the plots that arise in Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if emigrant families can meet again and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it involves something that goes further than being an informed citizen spends six hours watching a panel of experts debate on the use by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar fur bomber jacket ("a gift full of arrogance", said Washington Pos) and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what it makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with changes in characters and daily argumentary roles of Trump's show (the conflict with the N.F.L., the compliments to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to lose an episode or you'll stay behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was sunning and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house, on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He wasn't able to get away while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows at the time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money comes to more to finance the nominations to the House for the election of half the legislature
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a district of Congress with two representatives in career functions to occupy the same position.
This district located outside Pittsburg that was recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who obtained his post in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined in January that the Republicans manipulated the electoral district of the old districts in their favor.
The election career in the new 17th district of Congress triggered a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee of Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after reaching a victory set in the special elections of March to the 18th district of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
The political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States appreciated the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support to China and then put them behind it.
Diplomatics warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a nice meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners launched the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to return to the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions of O Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "new people's decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the department in a statement made this same month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against O Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US aid during 2017, included to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was fought.
The penalties proposed, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent emigration of people into the United States.
But in mid-September, important government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively putting an end to any possibility of applying sanctions for the Salvadoran people.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to conduct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance of the administration, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to O Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations always and when participants' anonymity was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Study History
The next negative case could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction of Mr Trump's justice, of which there are currently abundant evidence in the public file.
According to it, Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to discover whether Mr. Trump's campaign has conspired with Russia in his attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to render accounts in that body, just when he has to prepare for elections, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
Many are unknown and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the case with his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killings that followed.
The course of history revolves around those points of inflexion, and the inexorable advance of democracy accelerates or shrinks.
The Americans are facing several of these inflection points at the moment.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's research fate?
Rosenstein takes the water up to her neck since this paper reported that last year she secretly suggested recording to the president and speculated that she was incapable of the position.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that The Times' information is not true.
"How will we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or is not impartial or if its appointment for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the critical accusations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, above all, will we vote in the half-legislation elections for a Congress that demands Mr Trump's responsibilities?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which I knew from the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to put shabat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that heritage, how am I not going to be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans player is optimistic about meeting the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receives Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against the Villarreal this same month, would put them in a very favourable position to be ranked in Group G of Europe League.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from launching this season up to the 2-2 draw in front of the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a trap to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the party believing that we could get something positive and reach a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but, in general, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope we can reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last party, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we will be able to fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was hard between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes made on the team, but there's an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope we can fight, forget last season and succeed."
Women worry about savings for their retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had made it clear how they wanted them to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about it.
Approximately half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide stated that they commented with their couples on the cost of long care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to take care of her as a family member, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide life insurance department.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your spouse and children, you can't prepare your family for care if you don't communicate your wishes to them in advance.
He collaborates with your advisor and your family to wake up where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Prolonged care funding options include a traditional extended care insurance policy, a hybrid cash life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
It also values the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You must choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your father or older mother has a medical emergency and he's on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Please note in detail that information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who care about it?" asked Martin.
"What are you taking?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Set up a plan."
A man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man got multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after going out at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in his chest, abdomen, and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place at about 2:30 p.m. (British Summer Time) as a random act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His wounds aren't serious, and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused at least 384 deaths, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Because of the cut-off of the communications, rescue bodies could not obtain any information from the Dogalga Region, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
We then provided some key data about Palu and Dogalgaa on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with an approximate population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dogalia is a region that is over 300 km from the northwest coast of the island of Celebes.
This region, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main cornerstones of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Domigaa.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Célebes.
Palu and Dogalea have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dogalia.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Domigaa in 1996, leading to the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the high seismic Pacific Firebelt, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which took place on December 26, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees of magnitude struck the south of Xava, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, resulting in the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees of magnitude occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees of magnitude affected the Mentawai Islands, in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and caused the deaths of approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya Regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami mortals.
There was no tsunami on this occasion, but more than 100 people died from the collapse of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily shot.
Arrest Sarah Palin's eldest son for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29-year-old natural of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested suspected of a domestic violence crime, preventing a complaint from domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility units with a $500 bail, according to KTUU.
He presented himself to the judge on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, of course" when he was asked, informed the prison.
Palin's dealing with three minor offences of type A, which means he could go to jail up to a year and get a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor offence of type B, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time criminal charges are filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Court for veterans of war in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of handing him a fist in his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after linking his son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome that suffered after serving the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia caused hundreds of deaths
There are at least 384 dead after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami to destroy thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not available, and the balance of the dead is expected to rise with the passing of the days.
The earthquake took place right in front of Central Celebes, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Iacarta.
Videos are circulated by partner networks where the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a few times the death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway Avenue of Lower Manhattan, tracking the lives of pawns and cyclists who found on their way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intendedly" and caused serious "intendedly" injuries, according to the notification of the intention of a death penalty application filed in the South New York District.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the judge's document.
Weeks after the attack occurred, a federal jury filed with Saipov a charge of 22 crimes, including eight crimes of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "markable planning and premeditation", the prosecutors declared when describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the notice of intent to accuse.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For a decade, the South District of New York hasn't tried a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted by conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack on court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of the ISIS that he viewed on his phone according to the accusation.
He also asked to see the flag of the ISIS in his hospital room, the police said.
He declared himself not guilty of the indictment of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting a life-threatening conviction without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A tory MP claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize a "people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Ordinary Member Peter Bone said in the face of Birmingham's demonstration that the United Kingdom "would have left the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile the split ranks of her party was evidenced by joining the Tories in favour of remaining in the EU for an independent protest against Brexit in the city.
The first minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between the attacks of the Brexit, the reverse and the EU supporters.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave de Solihull movement that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been able to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been given office, we would already be outside the EU at the moment," he said.
The members of the Wellingborough Parliament added the following: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan'.
Showing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone denied the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely false".
The member of the tories and supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also came to the march, since he told the reporters: "The only thing I say is: first minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity among public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Checkers plan and start listening’.
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians "feel uncomfortable" if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Today this is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we're meeting today to tell them that we won't let them go with theirs."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit's decision, to feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilising the army of people in this country who gave us the Brexit victory and will not rest until we become a proud, independent, autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU made a march through Birmingham before celebrating a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit) message after the group's release this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of the security problems they suffered in a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy free market without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
The concept of good Brexit doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about presenting himself for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider her candidacy after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in a town in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is going to present the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been focused on speculations that place it as Trump's successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his electors using the Town Hall format since Trump took the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to introduce the president.
Warren answered that it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and that's why a woman needs to be in the position of the presidency."
A detention related to the death shooting of Sims, the LSU player, was performed
Baton Rouge Police, The Angels, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested by the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced Dyteon Simpson's 20-year-old detention on a press conference held at 11:00 (east hour).
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who went out on the images.
Yes, 20-year-old, he was shot near the Southern University campus at the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and finally died as a result of it," Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2 metre youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 headlines last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is coming to world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, who left the pole, had a good way out and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into boxing first and let Hamilton run traffic on the back of the group, which would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxing a little later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after several wheeled maneuvers that caused Ferrari's driver to suddenly leave the inside at risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the output grid and went up to the seventh square at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he led the race for a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tyres to get faster in the final part and forward Kimi Raikkonen to fourth position.
He finally got into boxes in the round 44 but couldn't postpone any position in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
An Inappropriate Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech in an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the witness given by Ford in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate proved that people were "mersible, disgusting and liar".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is going on in the Senate last days, when you see the outrage, when you see that people who are angry and miserable, disgusting and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and filtrations and they say, "Oh, I wasn't.
I didn't go."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make any filtrations?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?' Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
Did we filter it?...No.”, he added by imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration had come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," said Feinstein to the second committee.
"He asked me to keep his confidence and did what he asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the Saturday evening act: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
I may not have filtered it, but I used the worst body language I've seen in my life."
Continuing his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using accusations for their own ends.
‘They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to hit to recover power and control," said the president second Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered on Friday at the Elite League against Belfast Giants winning the game back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early advantage through two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the local set before Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard tied up for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to climb up to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time encounter between the two teams, with a balance of the three victories prior to the Giants' prol.
Dwyer's initial goal came in at 3:35 thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In a tense initial period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to score the goal of the draw at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants advance in the score before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.

Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined each other to help Nielsen join Dundee for the first time in the party at the end of the second period and assured the victory by the fifth goal of his team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home in Milton Keynes their next game, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on an airplane can escape from an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered to be a hero after death to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The balance of dead people is 800, and there are many disappeared after a great earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and there are many people who are trapped under the waterfalls of the city of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Mayor refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower in Palu, which was violently rocked.
He stayed in his post to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the exit track at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision might have allowed hundreds of lives to be saved, reported the ABC News channel in Australia.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
‘Set your heart around us while you hear us,’ he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death balance may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Dogalea, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance of victims is created that can continue to increase because there are many bodies under the shells and many of them could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are transporting help and lives.
A 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the mini-markets».
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing one after an airplane accident in a lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing one after previously stating that the 47 passengers and crew left the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that she was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships in the area helped rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the pond before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane went a long way to the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he came in very little height.
"That's something extremely positive," commented Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers were able to move through the water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were shouting and scared, and that he suffered a slight wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working close to the site in the tasks of improving a dock also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to the shore before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none affected Air Niugini.
An analyst makes up the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office went to the tests on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to re-compose the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis's movements, and the 19, Jessica Chambers' victim on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was meeting with Chambers the night of his death contradicting his previous claims according to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When this data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers for the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stairs on Saturday and testified that day he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he declared that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"The draft of his life," said Hale.
It's scheduled for the defense to start its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge stated that he hoped that the trial would be brought to trial by the jury that very day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A threesome hip hop wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that hip hop has turned away from its sources with political messages and struggle against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the hip hop combative back into popular.
Artists like The Runges and Common recently experienced a surge in the United Kingdom through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York child caretaker asks for a couple after a "racist" message
A New York child caretaker is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that would not be addressed to her from the mother in whom she complained that she was "another black."
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her distress when she discovered that the caretaker of children Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER NEGRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and was expecting a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid for the day of work and she was sent home to an Uber.
Now Maurice's going to sue the couple to get compensation for dismissal and demand a compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even though there was no contract by means.
"Look, I want to show you that these things are not done," the Post declared on Friday, to add later "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusations of racism claiming that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife had sent him a message that I didn't intend to send him.
He's not racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they offended, even though it was due to a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on!
After comparing the demand with an "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Will they go for a person like that?
That's not very ethical," added the investment banker.
As the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and for the logic applied.
The Paddington editors feared that readers had not identified themselves with a talking bear as you can conclude in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented the following about the letter: "It's hard to put on the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we know about Paddington's huge success now."
After claiming that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agridose" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you're proud even though you didn't really do it.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little like that.
Even though it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
After the landing, his daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save his life.
"Nad regularly called to say that he was very bad, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I got the call from Nad to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
I had died a while before and now I was turning off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that it was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapereus, at that moment of struggle for her daughter's loss, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
"No one detected it," he said.
"He had his head down and I was tearing down at all times.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this amazing feeling of solidarity by Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Posts of women afflicted to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been placing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to which you can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any father to feel like I have to feel myself every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
Nevertheless, he left work before he died and was "in a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented, "I am still concerned about a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, has lost her spouse Mark for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't comment on me being sad or depressed or anything like that," he remarked.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
The Christmas Day touched the bottom (when the children opened their presents, he made no visual contact with them or anything)."
He said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He ripped the family apart.
He let us down.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs a thread as the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (a research for a limited time and limited scope), we might be able to get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that I was afraid the committee was "extinguishing" due to the paralysis of the supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do the investigation?
Their reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
The election of half the legislature (November 6th) is five weeks away. If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, currently occupying 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea is low under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korea deserters destined for South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, stated that 1,127 desertions occurred last year, far from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people in charge of crossing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of the Northern deserters are finally offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul declares that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the largest border truce with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters illegal migrants rather than refugees and often return them compulsory.
The relations between the north and the south (which technically continue to be at war) have improved significantly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This occurred after the historic June meeting between President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, in which they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress ever since.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't trust our national security and, under those circumstances, there is no possibility that we will be disarmed unilaterally first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and says it's not appropriate to access the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and assured him that he was not fit by his nature to access the Supreme Court.
So he made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever behaved that way, they would call it hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh proved very excited, at times almost shouting and remaining talking while describing his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the committee, cataloging the accusations against him as a "murder of the grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angry by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
He objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed at the post and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court you're currently in," Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
He added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the law of patient protection and care for accessible health or the Roe v. Wade case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh denied questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to come to court and still on top of it wait for us to say, look well!" said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
It's a justified dynasty, months and years of rage overboarding, and you can't kick it out without crying.
"We made it when we got angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do I?"
He continued, "I received a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then it went on.
It seemed brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my most sharp memories in one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, in which I started crying with an impossible anger to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from behind the neck, a distant superior who had always caused me a slight fear, and drove me to the back of the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an adventure outside of marriage on a ship named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
"It was not a well-thoughted decision," I was told by laughter 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancanoves and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed to raise funds, so you swore you wouldn't run for the presidency unless you could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only bring him $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (thank you to the people who supported it, by frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and to address the voters instead of the delegates and angry with the existing sexism) who ran out of words.
"You would think I had suffered a nervous crisis," reminded Mrs. Schroeder about how she reacted to the press with her.
"You thought Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"Have you chosen?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were disturbing and, despite the fact that the war is far from over, a distance between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of this year recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200 billion, recording half of the articles coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has consistently countered, the most recent rising rates from five to ten percent in 60 billion dollars in American products.
China has promised to imitate American measures and it seems unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will change in the short term.
To get Washington back, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but bend publicly to the United States would be much more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts claim that if Beijing knows how to play his cards correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favour China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions needed to start an economic crisis in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than it was previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, an Asian-centred researcher at the Center for New American Security, a center of studies.
Syria is "listed" for refugees to return, claims the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the necessary conditions are now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to abandon because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or countries supporting the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the U.S. team for a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Miccelson, who was the best battle he offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the 16th of pair 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all his series, becoming one of the only four players who got a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was implemented in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst-ranking player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's first ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against English, Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups fought, Spanish Sergio García became a European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I don't often cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a hard year.
I'm very grateful Thomas for picking me up and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the drink back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad I could have helped," declared an excited García after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who was able to defeat the American legend of the Tiger Woods golf for 2&1 in the individual Sunday party.
"It's amazing how proud I feel today because I could have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, 14 major winner, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems throughout the weekend not to get out of the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning they put the Europeans in trouble.
We fought.
I took my hat off before Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize ourselves, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go ahead.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be a captain.
It's to get the hat out.
They were superior."
