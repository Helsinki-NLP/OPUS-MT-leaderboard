I read several books last week.
I noticed she sat in the front row.
I opened the box, it was empty.
I thought he was angry and going away.
It was me who called at the door.
I called earlier.
I saw the man hit by a car.
Wow, I'm sorry.
He fought against racial discrimination.
We went without him, because he wasn't ready.
He left on a trip to the United States.
He died three years ago.
We called the door for five minutes, but it was in vain.
They had to amputate Tom's arm.
They went to the subject right now.
He walked by my side and pretended he didn't know me.
He lost all the money he had.
He painted the blue door.
He tried to run the orange.
It was great, I went to Kyoto.
It was negligent on her part to leave the door unclosed when she came out.
It was an anonymous denunciation that allowed the police to reach the terrorists.
It was a great night.
It was a terrible week.
It was a nightmare.
She sat in front to hear it.
He returned home three hours later.
Come here every five days.
I see the moon on the horizon.
You come here every day?
Come any time you want.
You come here every day?
We're wearing wool in the winter.
Watch your cars across the street.
Come with us.
Come any time you want.
Come any time.
Virtue and vice.

Live near here.
They live across the river.
Do you live in Tokyo?
I'd like to meet your older sister.
I'd like an aspirin.
I'd like a clearer tone.
We want complete prayers.
I wanted to buy the book, but I realized I didn't have more than 200 yen.
You want to marry me?
You want to do this now?
You want to play tennis with us?
Would you like another cup of tea?
You want a beer?
He wants a watch like yours.
He wants a watch like yours.
You're taller than her.
You need it.
You don't have to eat it.
I want to go to America someday.
I want to learn the spirit.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I want to stay here.
I want a book. Where's the bookstore?
I want to see the ocean.
I want to live in a quiet city with clean air.
