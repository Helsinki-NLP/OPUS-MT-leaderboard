I thought he was angry and going away.
It was me who called at the door.
I called earlier.
I saw the man hit by a car.
Wow, I'm sorry.
He fought against racial discrimination.
We went without him, because he wasn't ready.
He left on a trip to the United States.
He died three years ago.
We called the door for five minutes, but it was in vain.
They had to amputate Tom's arm.
They went to the subject right now.

He lost all the money he had.
He painted the blue door.
He tried to run the orange.

Come any time you want.
You come here every day?

Watch your cars across the street.
Come with us.
Come any time you want.
Come any time.
Virtue and vice.

You want to marry me?
You want to do this now?
You want to play tennis with us?
Would you like another cup of tea?
You want a beer?
He wants a watch like yours.
He wants a watch like yours.
You're taller than her.
You need it.
You don't have to eat it.
I want to go to America someday.
I want to learn the spirit.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I want to stay here.
I want a book. Where's the bookstore?
I want to see the ocean.
I want to live in a quiet city with clean air.
