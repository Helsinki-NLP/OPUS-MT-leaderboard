A Republican Strategy to Combat the Reelection of Obama
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
In this spirit, a majority of U.S. governments promulgated new laws from 2009 that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon took on an increase after the November 2010 elections, which included 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in the only year of 2011.
New electoral laws require electors to present an identity card with photos and evidence of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to register as an elector on election day and withdraw citizens with a judicial record from their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirms in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The republican authorities began to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, 21 million people of voting age, do not have identity cards with pictures issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new electors in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to get the required ID card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required identity card with a photo.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to be more voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed in a number of States to use their identity card with photos issued by their institutions.
On the other hand, these same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly designed to limit the Hispanic vote.
It appears, however, that two Spanish voters out of three favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the recording of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 dropped the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted legislation in five other States to reduce the voting period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, while they represented only 13% of the electors in the state.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites who formed 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of electors.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules in place will undoubtedly make exercising the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see a clear objective of influencing results in 2012 in key States.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Centre shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to assert with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes have wrong results, with false negative results or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What to make the men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more reluctant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among witness groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have strong recommendations.
Another study, this European study, concluded a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who had not had a screening.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that there were between 30 and 40% more chances of having metastases if not tested.
So I recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are painless.
The degree of risk of cancer should really be understood by providing the patient with the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, and instead opting, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to be actively monitored and if the disease progresses, they will be given treatment.
Increasingly, precise criteria are determined to determine who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend that you pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not you should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Orology Society, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the potential for and against the APS test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, this rate would climb to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many of them also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is associated with 85% of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
That night is a big night for people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments the spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouragement: 10 years after the cigarette has been abandoned, the risk of dying of a cancer falls by half.
Weight
Embonpoint and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," it adds.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
Carliceries too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," one explains.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the linkages between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive for now.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another observed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and family background with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
The Rugby of Higgs
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole mess last summer, and for the cause.
It is believed that this boy participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, nothing but that.
And then this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been seen empirically.
But for physicists, it's not yet entirely certain that this is the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we hold a genuine new particle, and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a large physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain of it.
Let's assume that it's the Higgs, because the chances of cheating seem thin, and let's see what it's about.
In this low world, there is a fatally inevitable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
Although the physics of particles is a very strange world, it is evident that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of Pauli exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state" - this "state" consists largely in some of their characteristics.
Hence, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens named fermions, who obey Pauli's principle wisely.
And in the other there are boins, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for nothing - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can be and well found in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons then divide into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, indeed) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the memons, which we will not approach here, and the "particules of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate themselves and to which the boson of Higgs would somehow be related.
These bosons, we must emphasize here, are not all as exotic beasts as we could believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a bonus of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messier" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, a little like a lime thrown into a pond.
From this "disorder" there is an electromagnetic wave (of light, or of infrared, or of ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the boins "bearers of force".
More stable field
The same goes with the Higgs boson, to this difference near that it is another field, the field of Higgs, which must be "disturbed" to make this boson appear.
But this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to excite it, it must reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could narrow the surface.
That is why we need a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles, nor all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be on a refrigerator by himself.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that make it have a mass, while the others (like photon, hold) do not have one.
Now, what "can bring" all this research, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to search any gap between observations and predictions of MS.
In fact, they are many who are eager to find it, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "physical novel" and seal some holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, not proposing any explanation for the gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ops!).
But we haven't found such a difference in CERN until now.
Effects
The impact of this research on Mr. and Mrs. Tut-le-Monde's daily research is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no.
Consider: early in the 1960s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first was pressed), in 1962 - initially the laser was rather seen as a "Labo gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small sensor of light in 1969, during his work on optics.
This sensor, although it was not at all his original intention, now serves as a "eye" to all the digital cameras in the world, and has valued the 2009 Nobel physics.
Of course, this doesn't mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die...
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed shortly as a bill prepares itself.
In this vital area, however, much remains to be done.
Duty tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was treading it had left him a repeat of two years.
"They had given me five years to live, I did seven years," he said, half-girl mid-Raisin, lying in his bed at the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where he arrived the night before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even from eating alone.
Stuck in front of a breakfast appetizer, he agrees to let himself help eat, reserved.
Courageous, he even smiles, talks to the unknowns around him, brings him his medication, offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for me to be cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In our lifetime, we learn that a man, it pisses up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois house.
Returning to the child's stage, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept the regression, he notes.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, there are great moments at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them is no longer providing "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die " conscious and suffocated " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I no longer wish in life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the coming days, she is expecting a final visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, we produce, with a group of volunteers, body care and food support.
It's palliative care, which we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you will accept to provide mouth care at the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar rate.
And death is part of the daily routine.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, dead in the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days go by, but they don't look like it.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoyed his last family assembly in the court, well-dated in his pillows, while his honor was tarnished, a 36-year-old man died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancerians under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the end of his life, whether at home, hospital or home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that causes fear of a number of doctors specialized in palliative care to adopt a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed out of the peaks of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid that patients only want to die because they don't get the right care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are looking at their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helene Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she abandoned a proven chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she answered that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told me.
Yet she told me I was done!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who seek to die thank the caregivers for not having access to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be refracted to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often use palliative sedation, which comes back to sleep until the patient dies, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer pretend to hear this part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unsolicited patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," that means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a Journalism Fellowship at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and specialists from the Italian Mafia relate day after day what they know of a formidable "system", mixing the building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
A " industry " which cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has crumbled since the great means have been taken," irony Jacques Duchesneau, a Member of Parliament in Quebec and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation of the wrongs related to the contracts of road work in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had consented only to retreat.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden funding of parties and corruption of officials.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, he stressed that the only Department of Transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," some referring to their instincts to reach a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will "show the stratagemes behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011, also meets with its army of auditors, investigators and government analysts.
In addition to the "Marteau Squad" police officers who, since 2009, would have led Montreal's "Eouts Cart" to put the gentle pedal on contract inflating...
Over the past few weeks, she has conducted serial searches and charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
It is suspected that they have seized repetitive wine jars in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers on the outskirts of Montreal and of Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambien.
The latter made sense by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the Mafia who returned the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambipa sowed in all winds in the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 to provincial parties (approximately 68,000 euros), especially to Liberals at that time.
He also acknowledged that he had organized an illegal fundraising for the former Liberal Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Cost-inflating sewer contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system worked round-the-clock.
Gilles Surprising, former public works engineer, detailed it in front of the commission: in ten years, he received gifts construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and wine pots totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts that he inflated the costs.
Other road officials have admitted to fattening the leg from 30% to 40% of the invoices, by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his caisses with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early November, plunged Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected in Montreal to draw the alarm bell.
Mayor of the Arrondissement of River-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, she rose from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "draws on a thread to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrenne and push the wrongs."
The process, she says, is "slow but positive."
We're cleaning up the plaie but we need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a guard, so we don't see the suspicious practices coming back.
Just like we do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "élus in the knowledge of the stratagem", when they don't jump into the morgue!
Estimateing 70% of the share of dirty money in the funding of election campaigns in Quebec, he irony: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to the parties to $100, but this will not change the donation, according to it: "As long as election expenses are not strictly restricted, there will be dirty money in politics."
He calls for a comprehensive revision of the system of public contracts and party funding: "We cannot go any further; to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow the house to be rebuilt on stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it in their own court...
"The PSG isn't the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you've taken a new turn with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I'm progressing with them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in the football.
But I'm not burning.
From my beginnings at the pre-formation center of the INF Clairefontaine at my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by stage.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to having very high-level games.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
It is supported by assistants like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He's got a lot of big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then I was getting out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you look at the first part of the GSP season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as our leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8 finals with the way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now everything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
First we want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, in order to be able to receive at the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in length.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the GSP provides the means for this project to be carried out.
In League 1, wouldn't winning the title, like last season, be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really have the heart of catching this title as a champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the skills to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right thing to do.
Even though the big teams like Marseilles, Lyons or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it away.
Do you think the media wait too long for the GSP?
It's normal to expect a lot of us in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame us, it's certainly a little frustrating.
We're wondering what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
Champions have been proven in the League to be able to respond.
Look at Manchester City that has not been qualified for the 8th finals since two seasons, they have also made enormous spending!
Looking at the money invested, we imagined you with 15 points in advance at the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "bounded" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that May we can have a smile telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking it away.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much better that it's said there's a "Zlatan dependency."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and that he has a lot of goals.
He came here for that and he proves he's the star of League 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he's done is really exceptional.
This moves others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I had the heart to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with playtime.
I've seen things there, and I've been strengthened.
Today, I manage to make good games in selection.
That's what I had hoped for since my baptism with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we must have exemplary behaviour.
What do you look at in the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We're well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will drive the Blues to Brazil.
The good null (1-1) taken out, on 16 October, in Spain is a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I've never had a game like that in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Unlike current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and costs of processing between stakeholders.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is clear: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure trading protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from pair to pair.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before coming back today around a dozen dollars (the courses are recorded on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to the world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this type of system.
But every time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both depositors of the book of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, broadcast across the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner of which, as a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file-hashing phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and more unique fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "make" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it's the right one.
The transaction is thus indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, to cheat, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other left orphan because both have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to 100 millionth, leaving the margin...
The challenge is also seen in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment undertaking using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also notes the possibilities for money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, giant soldiers were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a teaching book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
The carrier manages more of his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just send them an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, which ensures that thousands of users are present.
There is a general movement of questioning hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be necessary, but 2013 could be a turn," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us at all.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants who have been punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, such as the Soviets' time.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Truck and armored convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban deferrence on Kabul as of the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country by fire and blood because of the struggles between various factions.
Their taking control of the country was then seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants beyond the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They moved into business, taking over government lands to resell them to build up refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American subcontracts.
They disagreed; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American broads: the leak of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, girls as boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are cool with portable phones; television, and Turkish slippers that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about reconstitution of provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state, to a strong presidential power, deleting the position of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and already well before.
No industry has been switched on, no dam is in state, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only here to take care of it.
Without energy to treat iron or copper or copper on site, or means of transport to export it across the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of My Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the vast Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, will have to be able to re-establish normal reports.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' school, boys' school, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "get the hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of "civilo-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), removed in 2012, carried out, and carried out well by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, gourmets in local labour, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable surfaces.
What are we going to remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would help improve local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often at more than 2,000 metres of altitude.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection by foreign groups, what farmers have told me to want, they should be kept in their favor of a small, well-controlled and direct civil aid.
A Constitution to Forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, it has decided to play its total.
Taking everyone short, he announced, Wednesday, that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this Assembly two additional months to finish its work.
It was soon two years ago that Egypt was based on a provisional text, which was amended several times to weaken institutional stability and lead to legal scams.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For its opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "believe his word" and "detain law".
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that it is a means of bringing an end to the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
The use of such a precipitated vote is based on the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "You either vote for my text, or I keep the full powers", which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, a large Islamic majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing the appeal.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had shut the door, believing that they could not have made their views known.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 replacement members were added to the vote yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, the articles were voted unanimously.
Some commentators were also amused by the fact that one of the day's differences had been expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the constituent's pendulum was poorly fixed.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Subjects of all attention, article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of the sharia are the main source of the law."
Salafist parties, for whom the Islamic law was a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisia" responds to the Liberals, who see only one communication.
For they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular with regard to verifying compliance with the laws with the sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worrying that "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy."
The fears of Liberals are also attracted by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain in the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not olemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" Tempire Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be an ambiguity around section 220, because the terms used use the religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question might in the future arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the vast powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood submits that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the military's wish, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Only civil trials in military courts will be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
Blasphemy crime is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have a serious impact on freedom of expression, in particular the press.
In addition, no articles are relevant to the protection of women, reports Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not found in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The state leader's support will show them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of scent await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has retained five major reasons for your return to Israel.
Go to worship the holy places
Make yourselves indisputable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone entering these "baptismal backgrounds" will be affected by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the earth of Jesus' miracles: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is at this specific place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers walk the Rue de la Souffrance or the road of Croix (Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoria), where the trial was held, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the one of the Peter of the Onction and the burial place.
This is where the Christian center of the world stands, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected where the tree was grown used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave a few words accompanied by prayers that are then exhausted.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, former refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering lovers can go there by their own means.
For others, a telephony takes them to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which hosts many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
Ski slopes total 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods once inhabited the mountain top.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to almost 300 museums.
You can't visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting who are really worth the tour.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also the Tel-Aviv Art Museum.
It is mainly exposed to the paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of visitors' mowings and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Free entry and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns on the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and enter a total darkness.
It's sparking stars.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
The three large seaside resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinriums and giant aquariums.
Note: You can bathe in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can bathe there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
Azur-coloured water contains sauna and very easily retains bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes around it are a surrealist beauty.
There is a treatment based on salt water, lemon, curative sludge and to treat different diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also for just relaxing.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatoly and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Persée saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, destiny will smile.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross young married people who come to take pictures of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to walk into the Roman theatre, "to conquer" the fortress of the Crusades.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily interchangeable in shekels (now $1 is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
With regard to urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the week of work begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only cashier food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made of both milk and meat.
There is a wide range of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also houmous, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, mullus peas balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there's a lot of well-fed cats that wander in the air.
We can see them sleeping at night on the roofs of parked cars.
These feline people love passing places and don't refuse to be gloated.
The rental of a car varies according to the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 per day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs on average 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists went to Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51 per cent more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are controversial about what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and requires that each migrant worker pass a Russian examination.
At the moment, this rule concerns only those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, knowledge of the language will need to be validated, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate its language knowledge in Russian in order to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Persons who have obtained certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The review centre network will be under the aegis of the Russian-language Institute Pouchkine, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the University of Moscow State, the University of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have on many occasions asked the question in the press: what will this give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migrant service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many speak about the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before they start.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Problems arise for unprofessional migrants, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, certified Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to cross dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will torment for months without food and paper and will have to cheat between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive numerous complaints from our migrants.
"In them, one thing is promised to them, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passports, and they do not reach the expected salary," confirmed the Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who wish to come to earn money in Russia confirm that they do not only know the language of the country they want to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course it is not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow would only be a viable primary education.
Indeed, their families don't even have to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equiping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people start to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know your tongue, trust them.
"You feel dizzy and dizzy."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants with legal status.
Without a statute, there will be no formal examination or work subsequently.
Yet, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or stand up to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
Reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 nautical miles.
And then, you can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have registration, from which cases of extortion.
"They ask us for 100 rubles, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," told journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Be quick, don't hurt and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by the federal migration service employees.
Falsified paper comes from an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is twice and twice more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of the power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy these "paperheads".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination of the first time to attend language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: whether they were shot at the weddings or killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber ballasts in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the gunport permit by passing it from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Douma soon.
Everyone is not happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "shrinking".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "the foolish hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said to the Russian service Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and specialist in the BBC crime.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil arms laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, every weapon can be found in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel serving ten years in the Ministry of Education and the headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking arms commands
The first is "the military track," that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons resulting from the black market are those that are violated by criminals by law enforcement.
Baranets explains that they are weapons stolen in police stocks as well as weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols leave for sale from military warehouses.
Many of these people have often suffered explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires have been triggered in order to conceal the deficit," says the former military.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and break arms in the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes craftsmanship, a mafia has formed and organized supply," adds the former military.
Where do the weapons come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared by the Problems Analysis and Study Centre for Public Administration in 2011.
Experts have analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal files and public data from arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, come from the army and from the law enforcement forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market have been found there "because of the employees whose work is related to weapons," the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "unlawful sheets".
A seller and consultant of an armory who has asked to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one has purchased the weapons found by these secret search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he said, the sellers would look for new goods in the military warehouses.
The person buys through a unit, e.g. a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the merchandise through a grid.
"He transports it in town and sells it for 900 € by unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be elucidated, they purchase control from illegal arms merchants," the seller adds.
"As in a luxury shop "
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a guy shows up and proposes to come to Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "coin" to market.
The price of the gun, I got it on the spot.
Victor Baranets as a Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there must also come by saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American punches with someone I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't give it.
The young new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
According to him, the patterns have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "anything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," the military remembered.
There's no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we're going with the forest vendor and we're setting up a target.
"We let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from his sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we don't need any documents and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a specific amount of money," we write in advertising on the website "Buying a gun or a combat machine."
Users are asking for it and asking questions.
And we sell to the minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (contained spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of false sites and collects into the skin the people who want to buy combat weapons.
People fall on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves operating coal in Siberia

I have heard about this type of scheme: the site is usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," says the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself without weapons and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of false sites and collects into the skin the people who want to buy combat weapons.
"People fall on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia," he says.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, estimated by the experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a Gun" association, you can buy a Makarov pistol for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of the long-term warehouses through the direction of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Department's official data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes overall fell by 7% in Russia at 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs fell by 7.8%.
United States: Fast-food and supermarket employees are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through cassier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or collapse quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel with the increase in modest wages received by basic employees at Walmart and in the fast catering chains, the organizers of the demonstrations want to get the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at the time when a deferring rain of balances caught millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggered swindlers.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who in the world employs 2.2 million people, left their position to organize strike pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in stores of the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium classes.
Walmart sells everything: from layers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% less expensive than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of Walmart's poorly paid employees run their races only at their place of work.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell his cheap products, especially because of the low wages of his employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of elevator trucks or portable scanners.
The participants in the Black Friday events called for an increase in wages, complaining that the company's health insurance price had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who pays $9.5 per hour, it is a sum he cannot afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost the $3.2 billion group.
It is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred the entire salary increase on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store would come back to 46 cents more.
They will spend in a year only $12.39 more than now.
Walmart's supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the shops from 8 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items per second.
His cash registers made 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
The company's spokesperson Dan Fogleman assured in an interview on the left Huffington Post site that in all of Walmart's "less than five" employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com-operation among so many others" by the organizing union.
Next client!
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, which is why they are not yet implemented) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of servings and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage under federal legislation and New York is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases over time, but on average, its basic employees earn $8.90 in New York.
No one touches less than them in this town.
I think it's inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living in their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wished to remain there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal newspaper forum, there are comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
The protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 pm near McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue required that the fast-food cashiers and cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, a multiplication of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be established in the fast-paced catering sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration of an obstacle to it and punishes the protestors of a union by blasphemies or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifys their lives.
For a union, taking care of fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main features is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held close to several other fast catering chains.
The moment of the protest was the mid-day gathering near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they even give you no sick leave and do not pay you the work you've done honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in view, including the candidate to Mayor Bill De Blasio's position, who said that "we must all support the workers of the fast-paced restoration so that they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important event in the fast restoration sector in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated there without counting that they were not all fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is now hard to tell if this mass movement spark will make small ones.
"For the time being, we can only be able to deceive the brain"
Lately, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing the reality increased through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Cambridge Microsoft laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already of ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in naked air, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Would you please tell us in a few words what your search group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine, and at the same time we are trying to expand the borders of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment in flat-screen pixels and sometimes in touch.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the management by the gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has made physical interaction, a lot of things are going on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information capture has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, not really.
We're trying to change this and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems based on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We have to get the computer world out of ours, in the physical world, to make it more touchy.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around him.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice order?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
We cannot say that it is panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in his niche.
For example, in order to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought about gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, limited gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + voice.
- Is that so?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this cane?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at any time?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual rapprochement.
I believe that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
For example, it can be laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the present generation that we are based on our work on 3D recognition.
Of course it would be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not megapixels themselves, but rather the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to algorithms designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s really aren't enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, has given the sensor a regular delay in treatment between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how it affects the interaction of man and machine.
I'd really need this kind of device in my work, but I don't need to touch it, to have more frames to the second.
- But shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is in fact an usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or press it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how it could help define the locations.
- As much as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from a point of view of the day-to-day use of enhanced reality technologies, glasses are one of the most perspectives platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone the hands raised is not practical but here what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that's what makes them strong (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents to this idea point the finger: there is no touchy sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh perceived in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the addition of touch sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still low, of air breath on the ends of the fingers.
There are also wrist straps that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
To make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task down there that will have to be done for a long time: the way to make someone believe that is physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of racing carpets (neither with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the time being, there is only average brain deception, and there are still many years of work.
This makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The avant-garde petersbourgeois" dedicated to the citadins in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already hosted prominent actors from the art scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and who have found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravert painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this man rather bearded, all dressed red that you can cross near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or at the trendy parties and varnishes.
The tables of Kirill Miller always gather the crowds, regardless of their place of exposure.
He is one of the most deeply social and philosophical Peter-bourgeois accountants, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the Petersbourgeois avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance smiles on the inhabitants and puts them in good mood.
He recently took into his hands a organ of Barbarie and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg because he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city all red and not yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, image creator and society.
Even in society, everything that is not grey is causing aggression and a negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you understand that you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where my works were.
I understood it was my way.
So the wave of the old unofficial painters was past and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I started to associate with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces are to come together.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which before the work was home to a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian Bohemian Bohemian.
Many were born there: the NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The Earnings of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends were singing easy songs in play-backs in mowing jerseys, they included Igor Vdovin, a fashion composer today.
When the group started to occur live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg had a good time of programming before the time of Halifax Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic education and training was at home that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboidov": these are the impact of the artistic clinic.
Our employees have left there as a habit.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Pein of the Year," and that's when my kingdom ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a reconnaissable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very high level of accuracy and accuracy.
I'm going to have an exhibition programmed "The Russian Museum Through Clowns".
Clowns belong to an untimely category.
Before I was a social person, it hurts today and it's scary to be like this.
But with the clowns, it's all gone, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we need to spit him in the trunk instead.
And the lie will be wiped out by disguise.
- We've recently seen you in the role of the organ player in Barbarie.
Who else I can play.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be cured, delicate, liqueur.
Disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, the partisans of the bohemian love one thing, the naïves another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communitys, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw who came to see it, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and at the end of the account it's less management, money, all wasted.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to cheat them, not to spoil their lives.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that usually are the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, we often confuse ideas.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- From good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not all can work in culture.
Under the reign of good czars, it was not like that, the czars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are separated, because they need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and guide them.
At present, it is the "king of taste" that blooms.
The same Eratta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In us, this layer is very fine.
We have to make art the way it was in the beginning of the last century.

Hide in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with landowners on board are looking for a relief planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to live our species in a trap or on a relief planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be conquered, it would be only on the assumption.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICH).
If the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitudes or on Venus' orbit... in space.
We began to take an interest in the issue of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Another half century ago, we were experimenting with plants.
Four generations of small peas grown on orbit did not differ in any way from the terrestrial varieties.
Then, we put on insect orbits, small, reproductive drosophile flies.
In 1979, hen eggs were sent to the space to see how an embryo was developed into a trapper.
We get a perfectly normal chicken at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, it has to get on its legs and start moving," says the director of the laboratory of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMPP) Vladimir Sychev.
By finding no support, the chicks were disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die after four days.
"We shook their eyes twice, and then we gave up, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of experience with chicks in space.
The last biological miniature ark with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the Bion biosatellite will only board species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus in space.
In principle, no supernatural discovery has been found.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. We have to do this kind of research," observes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions have not yet been done directly in space.
It's not a big deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a proper emotional background.
This type of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is the most precious thing humanity has.
Our moose flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered that question," says Vakhtang Vachnadzé, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been on orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have little, even very few cosmonauts that have had nothing and give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this poses a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and Russian hero, Valeriya Poliakov.
Yet, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Centre for the Preparation of Cosmonauts: compulsory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in no float, cosmonauts train to the extra-vehicular outputs.
Water imitates the weigher.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The small Amphibians seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of his mother's womb, it is easier for him to then get used to water.
It's in principle logical, because from birth to the first bath, it only takes two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In other words, if for the child who has just been born the parent is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In the airbrush, the muscles of the belly, the basin atrophy very quickly, the baby's push capacity is lost.
All right, let's just ignore this by relying on the delivery simulators.
Of course, we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will get him out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite him to consider this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the Earth's attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress a baby like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a totally disabled child ", states the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, with time this will become reality, when the Terrians will go into their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born into space.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institute for the Control of Public Finance) said: "Control of self-employment (in Czech "the Švarc system") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is in the process of implementing it.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Institute for Public Finance Control, said in an interview with Aksuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, it is what is lacking in us," said Kala in her comment on the current situation.
Joint monitoring by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " Švarc system " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls; is it therefore allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting compliance with the law," says Kala.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the public procurement legislation in these two countries was compared.
What was the concrete question?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and particular national legislation and a practice that is properly followed by it.
We have gathered all this together and although this control procedure is not yet completed, very interesting differences have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and better quality", however, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continually develop more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what is the result for you?
Common control of this type should just help to stop us from trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a truly positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering market thresholds, we will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It could be that this system is so submerged by papering that those who search for faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems relating to the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organization?
As far as institutions are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized in a similar way, also has a somewhat different council, but these two institutions are essentially acting in a similar manner .
Skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany being a federal structure, therefore also has courses of accounts of this type at the level of the different Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which is ours for state resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities in our homes are controlled there at the Länder accounts level.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not want to make a general comparison without concrete data, but in some areas, Germany is often designated as a model, but it cannot be said to be doing better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider as a model is also faced with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, right?
As regards national legislation, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant for you as an institution, are its effects already felt?
Since this amendment has come into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do later checks, we have to have some delay.
Our observations relate only to, for the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new tool to "detect the risks of mismanagement" with which we have gone to the crisis of nearly 14,000 public procurement - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed and the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law to be an advantage or an extra burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more stringent and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulation, the claimant (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the Market Act meant a failure to the budgetary discipline.
Is it really good, then, to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but do not punish those who make formal errors without consequence of the decision-making process.
Such a system will put greater pressure on administration.
So what's the solution to get out of it?
Let's look at where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the ODS would not import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and authorize it," but he can't say that we're going to act as if nothing was.
The Contracts Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
Roads are frozen, but most of them remain practical.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were practical this morning, but by freezing and also snowy places.
Temperatures have dropped and oscillated between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should slightly rise in the day.
The snowfalls have ceased in the region and remain in the plains only a thin layer of snow.
However, the ridges of the Monts metalliferes (Krušné hory) are covered about 30 centimeters of snow.
The data from the regional road maintenance service show that because of fog, visibility was reduced by places.
The R6 and the region's national roads are now available without any difficulty.
Vigilance, however, remains to be placed, for example on certain bridges where the coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
It remains on some of their sections of the ice-cold snow debris and by traffic-tagged places.
Especially in areas at high altitudes, drivers need to strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Kralové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some routes in East Bohemian are threatened by the formation of mirrors and that traffic-tagged snow layers can be found on the roads in the mountainous and highlands.
Road maintenance services alert drivers against the risks of ice-cream training in areas of the Pardubice region at altitude.
There may be verglas in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on the departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were treated chemically.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of trafficked snow is present on the roads in the highlands.
In East Bohemian, time will now be dry, most often cleared, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will usually oscillat between -3° and +1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now feasible, although, by places, greater vigilance is needed and adaptation to weather conditions is needed.
It freezes this morning, temperatures range from -3° to -9°C.
After the recent snowfall and the cooling that followed, some channels of communication can be frozen by places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what information from the regional road maintenance service indicates.
The D5 motorway is practically without difficulty, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in Pilsen-South district and Tachov district.
Departmental and third-class tracks are wet and in this case warning against frozen sections is applied.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequent roads of the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to areas in the Olomouc region at altitude today must have a thick and soft snowy layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the cervenohorské seselo neck and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
The snowfalls forced road maintenance personnel to travel to the field this night; according to roadside services, more than three centimeters fell in the Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most of the shoes are practical without difficulty.
" Upon the heights of Šumperk district are snow debris.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník must expect to meet a thick and soft snow layer at the "Červenohorské sello" col, today told ČTK the chief of road maintenance services in Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in Jeseník district have also been on site during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment, roads are now clear and wet even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district, roads are easy to practice, however, drivers in the Šternberk district should pay attention to sections in forest areas with wet soils.
Regions of Use nad Labem and Liberec
From this morning, road maintenance services in Northern Bohemian reported several difficult sections.
Data from the police show that in addition to some snow or glass-covered areas, the mountain route from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, so snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south east of Bohemian Central Plateau, there are no problems and roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported for the time being.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of mirrors, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow source during the day, clear sky and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic lines, difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec are also reported.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of the snow until reaching the ground.
Šimon Hornest said, "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, it's more of a joke and it's said that we're the only group able to collect a rest of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years now.
We decided to use the marketing potential at the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11 a.m. 10 a.m.
The night before, on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will close almost at the time when the Maya calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the peaceful ocean, on a time zone in advance of 12 hours compared to us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded an anthem against the end of the world, entitled "End of the world cancelled" (Czech "Knex světa zrušeno").
Is it already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it during these charity concerts?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts.
Hymnes will also join at a certain time as part of a very unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also played the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings there too...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We strive to have them actively involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it is fun for them.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studyo Training Centre that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and we have been working on the implementation of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, for six years.
Teachers regularly go to students at Jedličv Institute and offer them activities that interest them and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to attend classes, we are trying to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project into a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers come up on stage at each of these concerts?
Based on what criteria, did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Lesbians Support, Illustosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will be on stage.
Details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" like this in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the Prague Spring; there too, we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic house in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that this looks like it at first.
We have five electrical wheelchair members whose gears have to travel in support, of course we also pack a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
Until now everything has been more or less always well done, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from which we have recently returned, everything has gone smoothly.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for persons with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you experienced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have witnessed in Moscow only at the east is in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to persons with disabilities; there it is not yet common that a person moves alone in electric wheelchairs in the city center.
They still do not consider it clear to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association striving to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
What is it we still need to catch up with the most developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with heavy disabilities move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather the opposite of the point of progress!
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among ourselves.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what motivated you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I'm a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá ̈a Angelovič said, we have lost control of the situation (false).
The success has only come in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
True, creating links with known singers and working actively to promote the group has helped us.
We understand that if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's grants, we can also enable us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of things that copy each other.
In some ways, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts for a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I would like to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural ...
But compassion is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
They are people who can live a whole life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not only an advance for them but for society as a whole.
Is not your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be inherent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's completely normal.
Some people come home with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to the rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Laá Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, we can't do anything about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the day of the scheduled end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 21 a.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fleda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relays when the song of the group The Tap Tap " End of the world cancelled " will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to gather financial resources (at CZK 25 million) to equip the Sudeo Multifunctional Training Centre in Prague at Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the presales of the tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this agency, the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, Poland's road to space started much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always find an understanding.
For example, I would like to refer to A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his cutting-edge work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the cold listeners and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Lédit Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of the world-renowned astronaut, his contribution has been rewarded in particular by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters on the hidden side of the Moon.
As early as 1925, a stream was built in Poland to be equipped with a fused engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
Nor is it clear if the rocket was to be used to propell or brake the drase.
The only known information about this stream is that of the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komorka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the retained documents that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photo-electronic hunting rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakiethobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywobblelocki.
Both projects aimed at military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects to use rocket technology were carried out by the Interim Advisory Scientific Committee ("Tymczasowy Committeee Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a company in the November 1954 issue of the Journal Problem, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to the aeronautical industry.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create an Astronautic Society
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international Astronautic Federation (created in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He kept his job until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological fusion, which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version was built, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and was probably 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have ranged up to 14.5 km and served to observe the wind at altitude.
In 1963, however, all development work was halted.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A fusion had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these gear types was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
The entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later should also be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Utility Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public utility work.
This decision raised in public opinion a lively discussion.
There is no doubt that it is interesting to examine this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means concretely that the different economic entities and national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital coupled with a scarred financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the labour price (salaries) generate pressure on prices.
The following meaning must be added to this term: a producer strives to import goods sold at low prices that are resistant to economic competition by "making the price of the competitor more expensive" in order to remove a larger share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, buy at low prices or disappear. The result is important unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and thus responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the State are necessarily increasing.
All this situation intensifies the perfect will of our fellows to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is at such a public level that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital generate in the different economies a situation in which governments of different countries are forced to embark on a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments are putting their own people on the mercy of private capital without taking account of social collapse.
This is mainly evident in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to push its own population economically to accept the private capital price dictatorship, particularly in the area of wages.
This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other by restricting employees' rights in the field of labour law.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, for years there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages as the state is forced to pay an extra to achieve the minimum vital.
Such a scandal has, for example, been updated in the case of employees working as an auxiliary to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all Member States in the south of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with wages of poverty, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
Here we must ask ourselves the following question: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; either this capital may not come, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also concerns all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, if they fail, that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the economy led to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly supports the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
The question then is whether private capital does not influence and even does not lead today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and the whole state.
The answer to that question is no doubt true.
The evidence is that there is a nearly all-powerful lobby in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual advantages, in legislation, where everything is condemned but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national departments are delegating the development of bills to firms of lawyers closely related to industry.
These bills are then adopted at the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as the Western constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State had long been in full delicacy and the functions were attributed to violence.
The blows of winepots, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The sub-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with already sold voices ... ... ... "The honest people did not seek to obtain any functions, it turned out that the state remained 8 months without consuls" ... "We really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was self-crime and that one must choose an energetic man" ... It is true that Appianos had in the mind of Pompeda, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absoltist regime.
In conclusion, as in the past, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, regardless of the interest of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
Today, as in the past, the result is a decadence without an elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems can be regarded as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human life, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Utility Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and internally in Europe, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will" says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the refrain is "do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, they wouldn't," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing of its right to self-defense and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, calling for the racism of the State of Israel, genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in the waves of recurrent killings; sum all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in this political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a "last curtain" view on the one to whom the tensions that have been taking place for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) have been taking place in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or owe their actions to someone who directed their actions based on previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers has not been able to be done in a single generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the tree (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
From the 1990s of the 19th century, they acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) to put an end to establishing links between their names and serious criminal acts to which they were mixed and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major participations in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they have not yet had such participations (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after Iraq's invasion of 5, after the overthrow of Kadhafi only 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Everyone who tried to stand up to this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Central Bank of America of Rothschild's status as a central bank and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I hear well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue own money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, and MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to try a trial against the EDF for triggering the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for global power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a three-world war plan by Albert Pike, a 33rd-degree franc, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, in particular the British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (a number of such slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those they caused in 1907).
Having succeeded in triggering the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir Habsburg to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly by a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the massacre of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
In order to make the second world war easier, the bankers have allowed politicians to create a situation of laten conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany of fierce war repairs thus generating the conditions of radicalization of the impoverished masses (then it is enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the culprits, offering simple solutions) and, on the other, they created a Czechoslovakia consisting of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (that it actually holds) of the fifth column to set fire to dust and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the basis for a massive emigration of Jews into Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers initially held it; or whether everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war reparations imposed on Germany were the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit up a firehouse that could trigger a third world war.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be like it during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a vast laboratory, the source of strife and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (it is enough to see how people divide themselves sharply between Israel's supporters and defenders).
Who is guilty and who is a victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong generates another wrong according to a circle of endless violence and where, at the very origin of all, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
We need to make a difference here between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, like us, international bankers only propose to people in the elections their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascist politicians, loyal to the face of international bankers, who do everything in order to launch a war with Iran, who could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) extend to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Ormuz Strait by which it passes 20% of all world oil (this naval corridor has only 2 miles) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
What light now appears in the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which any new born is implanted at birth an electronic chip making it completely controlled.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry a red iron mark on their hands or forehead, so that they may neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of that ferocious beast or the number of its name.
It must be understood: that one who has good sense counts the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to the man and it is six hundred sixty-six."
The film Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a number of demonstrators composed of Islamist students attacked the American Embassy of Tehran and held in hostages 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had been supporting his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the U.S. administration a positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, even worsened later by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The sequestered diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian Government.
Their fate in the United States sparks a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory in America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated peripeties, they found themselves in the Ambassador of Canada's residence.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rocambolesque cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team to make screenings for a large-scale science-fiction film.
Combination of genders
The expert's plan on exfiltration Tony Mendez requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation were long kept secret, and the film was based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - such as in the Ocean's high trilogy, twelve and thirteen.
The ambience follows: sequences of documentary-style Tehran (in the sequences under title are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which, thanks to these pictures, these same situations have been rewritten in the film, there are no great differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, corridors and telephone...
Ben Affleck managed to re-start his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected director and his acting game ceased to raise ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long film after the dark police officer " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive by its clarity that also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a history page is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false shooting team in the Teheran bazaar).
Too many actions to too many places
The director had to be content with a subject offering only a few striking scenes in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It is very good, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is separated by a telephone shot in America and the pursuit on the landing runway is quite pulled by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events to too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-ops, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a little dramatic tension, it is seen with moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 70's.
He's training the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of still history, in a certain way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omnidents, he does the matter.
Rules for swelling balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public survey of the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has been considering, in recent times, adopting a 40-percent quota for women in the management of large European companies has been the origin of our decision," said the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher, for the newspaper Právo.
Among the absurdities mentioned, for example, there is already the European Court's recent decision to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have been in favour of life insurance rates because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other idea as incredible as "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful environmental consequences, or the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low amount of dangerous substance or the directive on the size of the hen cages, resulting in the increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the de facto prohibition of the use of the term "bought to tart" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
The quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks threatening to use its right of veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, because bananas in the Union are not less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal flow".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonising non-homogenous national standards that complicated trade.
The rules on fruit and vegetables have been softened despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first price may be awarded in this investigation to the EU regulation of last year that a warning on inflatable balloons is to be included that children under the age of 8 must not be inflated without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American survey that balloons are among toys the first cause of child deaths by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age who blow in fair trumpets.
In us too, we have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone with an official role within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Laisz Fairis" association of Liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com has appointed, in addition to some of the nonsense mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risk, therefore, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to request grants.
However, these ideas do not originate from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund."In the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found full stocks that it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organized an invitation to tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for the acquisition of grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were specifically intended to be used to draft requests for grants from Brussels.
The EU declares: "Cizarious regulations are rare".
If the regulations often give rise to criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the field of its general development deserve praise.
More serious is, for example, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (fights which it does not always succeed) is a source of strong emotions in Czechs.
If, after six years of fighting against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomucké tvarěžky", for the name "Tuzemskýrum" dating back to our home in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar, not beet sugar, can be named rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, we are now in the company of worldwide known cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's massepain or Parme's ham, Karlovy Vary's biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice's carp ("Pohořelický a Třeboňský kappr") and Žatec's hop ("Žatecký chmel").
Pardubice's spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Hořice's Cornets" ("hořické trubičky") may also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, Senator Okamura says
Senator, how is it that we have the idea of taking part in the presidential elections?
It is not to be a senator or president who counts for me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under locks, and the taxes and age of retirement are increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that doesn't please, then I try to bring up a solution for it to change.
And as I am more than forty years old and as an independent member of no party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or Senate elections.
You have entered the Senate, but you have quickly set off for the Castle (N.d.T.: Chair's seat).
Don't you turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I've always said that I'm going to fight for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Afterwards, I stated that if I was elected senator, I would present myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the greatest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we laugh at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we trap those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition, the press breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said in my speech that I sully the journalists or that I was the counsellor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have begun the battle for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [CZK].
You have to change the law to that end.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I put pressure on tourism guide activities to form a liberal profession, I won the cause.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or right with a good project, it is scientifically denied and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorization and dogmen, taking from each party what is best for our country and implementing it.
Do you think of yourself as a man of the right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people put me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we were moving forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right but that they gather people.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said didn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken of them.
But without the support of the parliament, you have only slogans left.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you can, for example, impose physical and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them at my camp in order to impose them.
If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to transmit on-line television my request to the Presidents of Parliamentary Parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the President's election to direct suffrage, it was obtained through pressure from public opinion.
I admit, without ambition, being an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just started politics and I'm trying to get the majority's support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and return to the private sector.
It's a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make a difference, that's why I went to see a number of personalities asking them to attend the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fraud in the bush.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Despite everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial resources.
Nor do I have money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property to approximately 60 million.
In Prague I have a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
Either way, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a boy's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving by car, was flirting with women and fighting against evil and abuse.
You're in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million worth heritage and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in charge?
I've already invested 2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign fees are generally covered by the remuneration that I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example paying my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I'm not going to run for any election.
So you're going to continue your business to live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in deafness?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor?
I won and I keep winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince themselves, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly erected - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, and finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a pass on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large neighbouring company, tells us: "Yes, he is indeed beautiful, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
Today, no one is going to go to one of these high-ranking libraries for his own good, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, has a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city, a few years ago, decided to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small painted concrete miniatures.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities have realized that there was only one way to get their hands on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam MVRDV's Architects' Office, master of audacious batons diagrams and creator of spirited and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual flegme and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a scratch on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking, disconcerted and hoisting their shoulders, Maas, confronting him, stacked his books of choice by order of size to make a pyramid, and finished his speech backed up with activist arguments by a: "common wax!"
Here, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain has landed.
The building is part of a revitalization project with underground parking, supermarket, post office and some buildings and houses for a total of 50 houses.
Early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
That is how this little terne village, which so far had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a mayor of a harrowing landlord, whose white façades invite to think that they sheltered a dairy, enriched a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in his history.
The Long Way to Read
First impression: Eldorado of the book under bell at cheese.
Of course, an elevator carries you to the heart of the massive, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you crowd the floor of the building in the discovery of its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the ground in Dutch brick and elegant reverberations speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public banks, dogs and small boys and girls who play ball.
And all over books, books, and more books.
"Normally, library rays are located along the facade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We have completely disturbed the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been well equipped: in the middle are offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the technical plant of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes shadows, sometimes balusades, sometimes climbing ramps.
A new experience for viewing, touching and smelling.
Even the architects and engineers in the Indusian building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in an agricultural company ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, for years the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thickness is used as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then you can throw it away.
For the library, the membrane was first compressed in such quantities in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the summit of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 metres, the literary café offers us an impressive view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute mainly to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model eco-design project," Trouborst says.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior little time, even the days of beautiful weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted through the glass façade serves as a sunscreen, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores are responsible for the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic informatics, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there, too.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" by Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure helped to fill the gaps in the library that had not yet been completely garnished (now it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays overflow everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline that is called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though it may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think she doesn't support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, however, without being overly critical of Israel.
At the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstention at the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposes this measure.
Does Germany have difficulty in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy that is defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of consistent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore clash with several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find that role, but they are on the path to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as France or Great Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It expresses the desire to adopt positions independent of those in the United States and European partners, including with regard to national dossiers.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position regarding the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention at the United Nations vote?
First, Germany has important outlets in the Near East, especially in the Gulf countries.
This is why Berlin must take care not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is without a doubt a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, as this is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is, in any case, a decisive element in the German strategic reflections.
Does Germany concern relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will only be respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
The United States, on the other hand, announced their veto with a clear voice.
Do the views differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, of course, the government cannot defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem so.
If you observe the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from engulfing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners on the other?
I don't think it's easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today that is not the case.
They cannot therefore enter a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are doing in the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will play a role in the future as a locomotive and will encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they have to play a role that marks their independence more.
Germany is playing a role as a major player on the international stage, and does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is it always difficult to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulty playing a more important role.
If one looks, for example, at the euro crisis, it is noted that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed of very varied neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment the EU does not fill this void, while it remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant for them and if they're only less appreciated, it's life!

"Market Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well known brands all over the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trade mark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys protection such as the company bearing the name of the trade mark cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, she's not sure she'd get a cause win.
"It's increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office specialized in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my office.
The copywriters need only a few additional letters to be able to record their trademarks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we register Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also being duly copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a classifier in which the records made with the Beijing Trademarks Office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the Zegna DF Puma brand, a name that the firm artificially created by applying a part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, shopping centres are located on several floors that sell practically only counterfeiting.
The cases of Pattloch, however, are different: its commanders are responsible for addressing the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially confers the right of Chinese companies to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai" as a parent.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
With this term, women are designated to marry wealthy men.
The Chinese authorities say there's nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and the costs of justice amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive light products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the world's third luxury market and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to remove the dubious records of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be obliged to pay money to the plagiarism, as he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of the jungle dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machine builder Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's buyer, used a blue and white logo that reminded him of BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost itself against the plagiars of Hong Kong and Singapore that had reorientated the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing admits that there were some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and space.
However, the office would spend the last year of an "emergency situation in the process of work to a normal found".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Almost 57,000 cases of this type were reportedly closed, representing a 75% increase compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain in pain at the office.
Cheap Action
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received over 1.4 million trade mark filing applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and this means that China is located for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have counted 1.8 billion yuan of registration right.
In other words, each registration reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components should be suspended.
However, the sender was able to maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade marks office had therefore rejected the objection of the Munichs.
Freudenberg has certainly gained cause from the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
Watchfulness Is Set
Today, the case is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
However, he added: "The procedure is long, challenging and it costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs, and the archive service has even had to review the actions of the last 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "big sum in six-digit euro" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see for ourselves," Wenzler confides.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to engulf Europe.
This would be the case if copycats in this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to place in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Warning is about to be sent."
Pattloch and advises German companies to be very careful in their business relations with China.
According to them, it is not enough to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather "record in China all that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, costs can be much more important than registration costs.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence rights to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as explained by Wentzler.
Or we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: Taping, Singing, Help
The Imbongi choral repeats to Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland welcome their arrival.
Here's the story of a link that travels much more than a distance of 8.733 kilometers.
First, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, basketball boots, ladies' scarves and moccasins for men are looking for the rhythm by hitting the foot floor. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers slowly expand - high, low, tenor and soprano -, they take, swarm and follow.
Feete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra leader almost loses his canvas shoes when he runs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the Imbongi choral repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age came from genetics in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: the zoulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Helped to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For less than 15 or 20 euros, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child of money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal in the gogo center.
Imbongi means "history storyteller" or "singler of praise".
No one can speak commonly the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the chorala has been repeating songs in this foreign language that she has brought to Germany and now to her native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 km by flight of Heidelberg bird, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, lies Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw huts or land, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphaned because HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can see on a smaller scale the ills that overwhelm Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of half infection.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is carrying the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of thirty.
On a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choral had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis saw mainly many children in the street who not only lacked parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without school diplomas, there is absolutely no prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who personally pledged to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a warm meal per day.
But just one year later, the chorale founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been working almost professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ISTs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhea (or gonorrhea).
Current ISIs are HIV, human papillome virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubis pushes and the galley belong to parasitic ISTs.
Which groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhage often appear in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute believes that sexual contact between men is the origin of at least four cases of syphilis out of five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungic), blennorrhage and human papillome virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread rate of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections concern young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillome virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has risen from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause genital abges, urinary pain, white loss, low-ventilation pain, and the onset of buttons and locks.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases may also be transmitted through lubricating infections or close physical contacts.
The experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sex partners pass regular examinations.
Most fast-disputed ISTs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, donations, but especially to the funds collected by the choristes through their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman who is sure of herself and who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well placed, in one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, this is what we call the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure that they go to school every hour in their uniforms.
An orphan who has no one else is welcomed to a safe place at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, just like the two cookers who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. Together with the U.S. health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV testing test for many residents.
This is not of itself, because although the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"Side is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a topic that touches sexuality."
It's pretty curious, coming from a country the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These emotions sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers also spread the virus across the country.
But we find condoms at every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi chorists travel together every two or three years in South Africa and ring full songs of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many people on the tip of the black continent still know of the time of apartheid.
The bus full of whites that sing in African language is a sign of recognition as it generates not only good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears up to some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the chorists visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," people say there.
And after a flight of 8,733 kilometres of bird, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choristes who tap foot in the Bergheimer Straße repeat room, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe provided evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA's US Space Agency has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe provided evidence of ice cover in the region of the planet constantly plunged into the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that could go up to 20 metres.
The water probably comes from comets or maybe from asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one is linked to the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unknown to the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe infinity.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet Naine Heavens.
As Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Cerès is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink spots, more difficult to identify, are the "new-born" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where the stars are born, called "W5", a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant glow of a dying star.
The beignet-shaped circle consists of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifide nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, also called "the seven sisters", can be observed naked at night.
However, the telescope enhances the colors.
On this infrared photo, Helice's nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years in the constellation of Verseau.
His appearances with an Earth continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular tint.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope have been able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the biggest enigmas in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and most clean photographs the Hubble telescope has taken is that of the galaxy of the Tourbillon.
According to the dye, the photographs of the spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittarius, several thousand light-years.
Trifide's name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three lines of dust divide the heart that shine from the place of birth of stars.
Astronomicals photographed the premixtures of a cosmic carbage in the Constellation of the Serpentaire: 400 million light-years of the Earth, the nuclei of two fusion galaxies rush each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you do not like the technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "austral firewheel".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation Céphée.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years and consists of dust grains that are ten to 100 times smaller than the common domestic dust.
This photo has been developed from optical and radiographic clicks taken by different telescopes.
Here we can see the circle of black holes that is at 430 million light-years of Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula there is the brightest group of young stars in our dairy path.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are bound by the Rosette nebula, also create constantly young stars to 5,000 light-years of the Earth.
In this galaxy with bright rays and perceived from a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that it was born shortly after bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our gaze on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilée used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not ceased to grow, and thanks to them, it has been possible to see still further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Observatory of Mount Palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, there is the Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, on the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The Mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter also reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle level, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great light-gathering capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radiotelescope.
This radio telescope is 305 metres in diameter.
Any person who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extra-terrestrial intelligence") by contributing to the computing power of its machine.
View on the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO website in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clicks before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea's Hawaiian volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They were two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that watches the sky with the Subaru telescope and the ITF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that she had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space as early as 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
In particular, the telescope will have the task of finding light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the south pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercure's North Pole.
For decades, radar data indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There's even a long-lived museum.
An investigation into a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.

An investigation into a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to Talysh mountains is a stunning romanticism.
Around the road, the small chaotic bus runs along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where we see the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh, about which we don't know much about, if they don't speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastron with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometers, because the road only has one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilatea Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the oldest people festival in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, the only museum of kind in the world.
You can discover the life of about eight tens of Talysh in the region that are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white picture.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having another child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şerali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no act of birth.
And when we think that the oldest documented person was 122, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and he would have 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have designed a girl.
Would Şerali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about man at the great age of Central Asia.
"Acquainted elderly people also live in some parts of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is not possible to establish scientific evidence due to the absence of documents, regardless of whether there was no civil record.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is true that people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of that country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri Tourist Guide, explains that Talysh has particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the museum's director, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that food rich in calories from the Talysh, which loves meat, bread and especially dairy products and many drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people's youth? At Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, vit Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground next to a basket, whose contents are unrelentingly beaten.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long grown up.
Two little children also bragging in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf they hide long braids of a dark blonde that his son reveals to us proudly.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," added Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
All my life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she told us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of propaganda is surprising in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who nevertheless ruled his country as a dictator, knew almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham subsequently succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-held son is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on the sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not suffering from words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but especially for Christian Coptes, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
For all the members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi stated, almost by his apology, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his "to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what to save this 61-year-old engineer, a doctorate of the U.S. University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be overturned?
The 234 articles prepared in haste by the predominantly Islamic assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night force tower are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use vague formulation and the legal scope that flows from it to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it suggests that a newly introduced article states that, with regard to all subjects relating to the sharia, the al-Azhar university must be consulted; the institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its burst spread across the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would in fact lead to the placing under the supervision of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution relate to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts were working to suppress opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, in the project, be read, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morale and its values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the State could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no articles expressly guarantee equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what is an offence or how it should be punished.
It is equally doubtful that the wording suggests that it is forbidden to "offensate people".
Is it possible to draw a cartoon by the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points, therefore, are to be interpreted in the project Morsi submits to the vote and which, according to his own words, will be "very soon" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution was Renewed"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to drop the sharia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we are going to win", Hamdin Sabbahi launches, third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is "to be cast into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to foster a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expired," said Egyptian mediaman Khaled Ali, a political man and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-manifestation, not on Tahrir Square, by measure of caution, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and the Salafists' supporters, who participated in it in large numbers, scrambled: "people demand the application of God's law."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, asserting that "the Koran [was their] Constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where everything began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as their supporters, had expressed themselves loudly and loudly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the board of directors that the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned only once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have extended until February and encompass all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts in Mubarak.
He did it not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, judged and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are infuriating violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president has de facto replaced all of his powers," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be paid.
A protestant on the Tharir site warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the country's secret of success be linked to the premises' appetite for an extremely smelling fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most expensive dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this odour, omnipresent, imprints the air.
The rakfisk consists of salty and fermented trout in the water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and it becomes cold, the Norwegians gather together in mass to attend a festival taking place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this amazing culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you take a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people like small pieces of fish and stuff a lot of drinks.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," adds Harvard.
Drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in water-tight barrels in the air, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians had been forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigranting to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a full health system.
The Swedish, their old shores whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, although adoring, element in the past of Norway.
It's part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small beer pint or a sandwich will cost you €10 each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to displace it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they speak of "the July 22 incident."
The Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful country, one of them was able to commit such an act of barbarity.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success," explains Anna, our waitress, the blonde hairdresser, and the eyes of a transpairing blue, the image of the Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk plateau in her hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries were throwing money through windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep the cords of its tight scholarship.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," she adds in an unsuspecting laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and I'm tailing to buy me something to eat - I've had my rakfisk dose.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of propane, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I am staying is one of the many places where we use rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a knot-papillon, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It would be believed in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish, in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"I'm here on the points, Harvard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take up his duties in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the challenges he is facing and the people's expectations are many.
The road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal time, a security dam has been established since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is successful, with the results it owes to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in danger of a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has committed itself to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the US President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A highly populated and tentacular state that penetrates the capital. On its predilection land, opinions concerning this new leader are divided.
A Direct Man
In Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises assign to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of M Pena Nieto's new highways, a major improvement has been made to these roads, formerly wooded and full of cracks.
Plates bearing its name are attached outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to put in place lasting changes," said his political friend Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and the party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economics, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was won in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations in the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
It rejects the criticisms of opponents who blame the new president for lack of charism.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's an excellent state man and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the autoponds of the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military were called on to rescue to combat drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, ten women have been killed in the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr.Pana Nieto was a governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to identify the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in front of him.
In a concrete house, typical of this degraded neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came home, he seemed to me that his body had been washed away," says Mrs. Buundia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and body stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana clothes the wall, next to a cross where the word is: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old Commemorian, a troublemaker, a whimpering.
They want us to accept what they're saying and be quiet.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, he will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new President has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor," Olvera said to Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are attempting to counter claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning would have been victimized during detention.
The trial deals with Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Defence wants to classify the case because Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate, on Friday, that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being the cause of the biggest leak of confidential information from the entire history of the U.S. military -- lacked many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claimed he had suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints regarding his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request for Manning's case to be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning showed his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
Documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after meeting with Manning, during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked questions in Manning and provided their answers.
When Fein referred to the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment he had reserved for his guards was "excellent" and that his treatment in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints for ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but did not acknowledge the problems raised.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet it didn't mean that I didn't raise any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during a meeting in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to address the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and for the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted to have this status removed... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had planned to kill himself when he was in Kuwait and had disappeared once because of the heat.
He added that not knowing what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay on the move, as sleeping or lying out during the day was contrary to the regulations.
Manning also specified that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he returned at night, they would wake him up to see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stay naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was allowed to cover himself with a cover during the appeal.
During the judge's questions, on Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard's order that he should let go of his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to let it go.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, for he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his slip or tongs to hurt himself, but he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be convicted in a martial court, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defence stated that Manning plans to plead guilty of the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention are warranted.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, collusion with the enemy, illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of national defence information.
If all charges are held, he is in the process of a life-long criminal detention.
My identity crisis Mexico-American
He said that many had been forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunity
Mexicans tend to blame those who have gone; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexico-Americans find themselves trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
There were two signs: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extrangers".
I remained motionless for a few seconds, not knowing which row to lead me.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic qualification, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they say "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian."
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that my grandfather was born, no need for special qualifications or union traits.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, enough to manage an interview in one or the other language.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed for the "Foreigners" line.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their priority themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans remain in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for trade on the European Union model, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in writing half of their territory to the point of firing.
But for the Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are violating the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that of the country with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want us to address the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark, uneducated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is evident.
We agree with it in the United States.
We also know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and we feel as if we were individuals of lower strain and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed while they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, because Mexicans are more strongly demanding their identity and Mexico-Americans are against it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she's a part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel like being part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either of them.
In Mexico, we're seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as a fortune-saver for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must absolutely visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen links with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to handle yourself, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico-Americans always wish for the way their family members have been treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Cherles Oldies, New Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who began, tens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time rockets pulled out of Gaza landed near Tel-Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full motion.
The Arab spring has completely exploded, and whether or not it is desired, Palestinians and Israelis are caught by this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet, there is every reason to think that this could help them to get out of this deadly impasse.
A War That Does No Loss or Winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week's fights have strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will be forced to abandon the Israelis, even if Gaza has rocked up.
Killing some of its leaders and refouling the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas gains land in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals of Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Arab world's Islamists is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, took action and caused for Hamas; as was Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members are jubilant and say that the Muslim croissant bends around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, passing through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and even Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to dedicate to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas cousins, and their leaders are more easily relegated to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the supporters of the hard line of Israel will draw the inverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put in a box.
The Iron Dome-Baptized Missile Interception System has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both their ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have challenged Hamas to be the origin of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who completely ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket shootings in Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including through the barrier of separation that impinges on the West Bank, the main part of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish colonies that continue to expand despite their illegal international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud merged with an even more belligerent party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman on the approach of the election of January 22, has the beautiful part.
Why do you suck these Palestinian chips by giving them a status?
If they were leading the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of the line will take him away; but the Arab spring may change the giving.
Even though Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little of Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to manage their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire what is a good wish -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that becomes more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dustland that is dedicated to exploding one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a little like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
The repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two to three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic award.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains that of the reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now strive to put an end to the movement of arms to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a pseudo-state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, it seems just as reluctant to establish one.
It's a very strange vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital challenge for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packs entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand name
This law entered into force in Australia is a world-first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark green olive tree and horrible pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter young people from smoking by eliminating any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances that they never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message of tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said the federal health minister Tanya Pibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown with a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries consider a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would revive the black market trade, which would give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"Bad consequences will arise from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, from the British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesia will sell many more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had stimulated their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarettes, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has greatly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the high court of Australia.
He said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only one, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population group targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and have only a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the most important place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Do we have to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has given himself the trouble of making a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than marketing.
The industry went to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013.
Pibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make package warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now available in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you pick up the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package on which appears a photo of mouth tumor.
To be honest, the only reason I'll be stopped is my little girl.
James Yu, managing the "King of the Tobagconist" in the center of Sydney, said that uniformity of packaging made storage of packages difficult.
"Before, I needed an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government had only to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and we put the key under the door," he added, lifting his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spend a half-day at an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting the duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specialized in child development praise the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to pursue interesting ways, or even nourish creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the borehole open?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes very far," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evokes boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After travelling through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists "to do something but not succeed in engaging in a satisfactory activity."
What differs from apathy, he says, is that the person is not doing a job even though she would like it.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the trouble, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a mood mausade and the feeling that time is passing slowly."
The boredom can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or from the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we may think we're getting upset when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the sound too high in a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more upset than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this problem to the boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or relevant task, attention interruption may lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an aggregate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "how to look at objects on an assembly chain, music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he says now, we know that when torturing or scratching, these gestures, often regarded as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay more alert physically.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigot learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my flight of plane, a speaker with a single-recorded voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Schedule of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repeative and monotonous," and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of many and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are soon blasphemized.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of adolescents reported getting bored at school and during their homework at home, while 23 percent said they were getting bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentages of today's boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when trouble reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: Is the trouble good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to take absurd physical risks, betting or abusing certain substances to spend time, as the studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers refer to a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or self-regulation, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation moves from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feel comfortable outside the constant bubbling that generates activities and technology is the goal that we should tend to.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens a strong and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way of disconnecting and valuing stopping times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no guidelines for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19, student at a university and football player in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon become legal in his condition: the possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were on a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote to appear for possession of drugs and materials that could be used for his use - minor crimes, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has taken a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been ranked without further delay.
Police have ceased to charge adults 21 years of age and older for possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to indict those who own them.
At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West are currently voting to prevent the opening of commercial sales of marijuana approved by the State in their neighbourhoods.
"The things are changing so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of Aurora's police, east of Denver.
Regulatory agencies in Washington are also asking questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is desired or not, is in advance of most marijuana regulation states, first of all about therapeutic use and now about personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and it is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, he recognizes Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could be based, he said.
The Washington Act, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the permit system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical questions remain outstanding: how to balance the state's mandate that ensures adequate access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales within a radius of 30 km around a school, park, playground or playground.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City aroundy" (representing the public ministry) would no longer pursue those 21-year-olds with small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should cease to charge people for this "immediate effect" crime.
Chief Oates stated that the police would apply the new judicial decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, in the north of Colorado, the "district around" (Procureur de la République), Ken Buck, incarnates a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession issues, mainly in order to pressure users to detoxify themselves.
At present, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many are charged with other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those individuals who committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer appear as adults for possession of restricted quantities.
The representative of the county's public ministry, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all cases of detention of marijuana without delay.
"I don't feel like I'm losing my time to continue applying the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado's voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents people accused of marijuana consumption and who speaks as the local spokesperson of the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).
"They have spent a lot of their lives prosecuting people who consumed marijuana, too, have difficulty accepting it as legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small marijuana consumption at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.
While state defenders and representatives foresee a new legalized sales border, they look forward to the federal government's guidelines, which still perceive the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will pass away.
Despite some mediatized arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed commercial sales of marijuana for therapeutic purposes to practice in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are probably not going to break down the doors to seize small drug bags, there is much to bet that they oppose the authorized sales of marijuana for personal use authorized by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales trade, even though it was only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and it should impose this ban next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we are faced with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community's vote rather than in the state's vote.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was damaged and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only today's students who are attacked for their views.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowledge, a kind of Greek amphitheater of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I settled at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The newspaper of L'Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that students in the first cycle had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson pointed out that I was part after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yeah, I ran away, because I was a victim of bullying and was constantly blabbered.
Not because of my name rather ominous, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why would you mention this today? You'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of middle-right students undergo the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students at Oxford was such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as did gays, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the student room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College said they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want to have a representative in the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary released on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The country of wonder: Young, Intelligent and Right"), dedicated to student politics, which featured "Tories" as excentrals and neo-Nazis.
In particular, students Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (UCA), who moved to Rolls-Royce, was a complete silver tree and moved with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as scapegoats of the establishment of an increase in school fees."
Luke Black, 20, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "inconsolable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old President of the OCA, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are of the centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one thinking of that during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered September 1986, then I was 18 years old and was paralyzed with shyness.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - an old student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinian vibrations.
From the first days of the week of reception, when the new students met with the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen later.
I discovered that not only did the teachers participate in sarcasms towards Tory students, but they also took pleasure in it.
It was as if the policy of the grievors, privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was a victim of was about a translation into English of the 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a stuttering face, took it easy.
"Are the Tatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French classes during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy to make friends," he began with a bully.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner tonight, I sat alone and then I felt a slight tip on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even harder for you.
Most young Tory pretend to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
This stratagem failed.
One first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took the break.
I was perverse, man.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I only lead a normal life at Oxford?
Were I forced to meet people sharing the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become Labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years were going to look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never here.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, and his accession to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started sailing between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelievable.
During his studies in Oxford, in the forty years, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he told me pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dream bells.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's to takin' you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
With my frequent travel to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a work session conducted the following week, when another history professor suggested the most serious in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
Ruling inwardly of shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and treated them as "crazy old".
The regimen was short-lived.
It was my father who pulled the last nail out of my oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch’s press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed up in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers left.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can treat me like a wet chicken.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation at a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, who not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unbreakable reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian cuisine.
Somerset House, the former residence of Élisabeth Ire of England, is the only place of the British capital to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The tailor recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-couture models created for his sewing house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his unimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ point of a story whose only protagonist is "Mr. Garavani", but who could not have been written without his famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there is an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocracy cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest coutuir of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jetset.
There's nothing wrong with loving kingship.
"At least they don't crush their cigarettes on your beautiful carpets as some pop music stars do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all adored being invited to his Gstaad chalet," explains the former woman of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charism of the couture.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never pass away, because its creations are works of art," she concluded.
Defilée de ligne de nobility
Garavani's life is not a history of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves the very high people and with the highest titles and they love it too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a 60-metre wide glamorous podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the seat of the mannequins and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" dreaming of Valentino's main creations, such as the sizer he had chosen for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to the emperor Farah Diba.
Among these people, there are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the sewing machine in 2006
Many of his customers say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "not able to forget".
I remember perfectly well.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the tailor's museums.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he exalts our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they're bright and light up his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and moderate Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of being of age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red night dress, with a wheeled skirt, a cracked buster and a fall off.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg retains the costumer's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because a night dress is not only a dress, it is also the whole memory of her vehicle."
The "kings" of the mode
The grand final of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller brought during his marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girlfriends" (the couturier so calls his sewing machines) to realize this ivory silk dress with incrustations of pearls, twelve different kinds of laces and a four- and a half-metre sleigh.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the leading authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high couture of the late twentieth century, "the return of the clients of high society".
Obblished for years by the "being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated by the Legion of Honor, Garavani brings as many honours as any of its customers' husbands.
"I'm refined, his calm, his caring and perfect look have always leaped to my eyes," says Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my great friends.
"It was impeccable, the years had no effect on it."
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by carrying the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the earth's roots is solidified in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulphur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a tortoise all, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so that they do not stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their life, as it happened to a French tourist who had a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The minors of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once on the top, they cross a path between tourists photographing them as if they were circus animals, and carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometres to the balance that a mining company has installed a little on the counter at 1,850 meters altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it at 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry as this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who generally travels three trips a day.
Everyone takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows them to earn 138,000 rupees (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such an overhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (€1.20) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (€167)," says the carrier who used to work as a mason on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but then he returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I took her to Java for conversion to Islam."
Then he has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur had already started making him pay the bill although he covered his face with a mask and wore special gloves.
Then he has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French" he promises in a more acceptable English than acceptable.
Sick of life, this friendly and intelligent young person could be a tour guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a mule.
He shares an unhealthy wood measurement with other carriers, rises every day at two hours in the morning because the sulphur keeps freezing at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Ando went down into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp fixed to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers carry the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and provides no equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch a sub of the 30,000 rupees (€2.50) increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (€1.20), that the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for beasts, not humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left the college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "until he can" because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors into the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... which obviously add to their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, knees and shoulders pain, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, can only charge 50 kilos.
Each day, his companions and his companions drew 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carried to the warehouse of Tammasari, 18 kilometres from there by a trail of goats invaded by the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The elder of his five children, aged 30, also works as a carrier of sulphur.
Time passes, but endless poverty from generation to generation is one of the most difficult trades in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore search for babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans place the responsibility of this lack of children on career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, we fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from advertising for mint pills, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video spread like a dirt trail on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
Words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychinelle in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music so that people would fulfill "their national duty".
It is intended solely for the Internet, so we have made it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we feel that it was a theme that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes to the pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we said the following: What is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it as lightly.
It spends US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in accordance with its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was over 2, considered the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"It has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the creation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, we find websites that send a barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially towards Chinese people who are accused of getting wages down and not getting involved.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore experienced its worst election results last year since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem by introducing higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in birth rates has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government tries to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it began to touch the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the "footbox", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "footboxes" sell much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these housings are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more cost-effective for our treasury.
However, he admitted that the new standards provided clearer instructions to the developers, who had previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing in a project.
Too Many Stresses
Singapore is a state city.
If, as long as these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with the Singaporeians working in the central financial district, they do not seem to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, so people will give it up later," says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," says another young man over twenty years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and cost of access to ownership and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
Which is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the responsibility of the private sector for under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share on the line?
The newspaper ElPeriodic interviewed five young boys between 10 and 15 years of age, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" with personal and "word and username" when applying it to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private word on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I put nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my pictures or someone who would make the fool," he says.
The young boy admits that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures, naked people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine Twitter subscribers.
The majority are family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just put them," he added.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he says.
He claims he would never accept an unknown person's request.
He won't trust anyone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits that he does not know 20 people on his friend list.
"It doesn't bother me because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has made any progress or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would just remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we now have under the name cyber-harvesting are not foreign to the young boy.
A close to one of my friends was picked up on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was" he assured.
The victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"He only passed it in a private profile."
He then tells us a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I was angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyber-harvesting," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, professor of English and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way of searching for information, but, with the appearance of these sites, the game rule has changed," she says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they are children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who must teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say at an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective while what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them reflect.
"They say not to do so is useless," she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others are publishing on you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"On the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, so must be on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and educator, states that it is essential that parents consciously read the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that they should not speak to strangers.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) was concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Ephe tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of States and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially indicated that it would be disclosed after the conclusion of the summit, and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian Government's website.
When questioned on the text, they indicated that its content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, limited audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The few information circulated among journalists was given by press officers from some of the governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who claimed more information.
Later on, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this was the speech of President Humala rather than the official document that concluded the summit.
In October, Peru was host to the 3rd Summit of South-Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested by the press, it did not broadcast the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA site, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague which sets a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and declared that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleadings of both sides in the trial that Lima attempted against Santiago and that began Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are taking today before this international court," said President Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chili has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of international disputes, treaties and tribunals," President Piñera added, handing out President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the proceedings in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 project lines had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that Unasur countries would put in place "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve drug accessibility, access to the low-priced Internet in all South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triomphalist matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and find a better future for our people," said President Humala.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he noted that five related to Peru and were on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador, although it did not give more details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration within the Union of South American Nations", of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and well-connected with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, stated, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a judgement of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," President Santos said.
"We are going to revise all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask to have a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilised and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they have planned to assist in the power of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, at the summit, the Defence of the Block will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru is responsible for the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a joint citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on State television, TV Peru, that the Europeans "had been entertained during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but they were now almost a country".
In this regard, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by Unasur member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to be part of the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President supported the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, on the other hand, we, the South American, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa makes sure that he does not regret his decision, because he did not betray his principles himself, but instead respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were underlying suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice that demanded that he submit to an interrogation on a alleged sexual offence in his territory while "Sweden's own legislation allows it to be done by video conferencing, which could be done since the Ecuador Embassy in London".
Correa claimed that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked up in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"This works on anyone's health," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Equatorian Embassy of London, which would be the award of a safe haven that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and stresses that he had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the wound of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, as Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón has launched a whole series of procedures with various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted the safe driving tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as fully as its legislation allows, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be resolved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and he stated that what he would not tolerate was "the mediocrity, the evil faith and the lies that harm the freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of the freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists in the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he was pleased that this was not the kind of journalists "not the Bankers or the bourgeois and hegemonical countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting its re-election forward, "it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and draw the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must stand firm and not tolerate opportunity and attempts of disguised coup d'état", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Furthermore, the Ecuadorian President considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move together.
They need to be solved as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the good resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders that oppose Peru and Chile in the same court and affirmed that it is "good that Latin America seizes international forums if both countries agree to accept such a firm judgment as it is".
With reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to break a third consecutive mandate, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although this is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost primarys in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and I will then withdraw from political life.
If we ever forgive each other, I'll do it too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just discussed with Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse of President Chávez's health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today participated in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: seropositive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he says, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make it "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it in his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it and was so anxious that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He was undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit in Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he was found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because he was speechless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he notes that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectioologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of assignment of the immune system that patients presented at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years for CD4 rates of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a 500 CD4 rate.
To speak simply, it means that for someone who will receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "as long as he will remain under control, he will be able to live without problems until 75 years of age," said the scientist interviewed.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it must be known that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS fatalities has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the emergence of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May this year; however, access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years, we have never missed medication, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to perform more early diagnoses and, for this, we have to offer testing in a massive way, to all those who ask for it."
The specialists and members of the State AIDS Prevention Board of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who have had to do his testing in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and, despite his age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffering from kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I burst three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, through his testimony, those who are afraid today, at the march of World AIDS Day.
If they do the test, if they take risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV positive, and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, supported Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "there has indeed been an increase in the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of one hundred, it is very good, but it results, that today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", put with sarcasm and valuable judgments by social workers, guidance advisers, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, assures the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold to counters, but are found in the distributors of public toilets and in the places that young people attend.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, it is best to provide condoms to already sexually active people," he pointed out.
Figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in many of the new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th cases for the number of HIV patients.
92% of sexual contamination occurs, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal use.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A decision ratified in appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a harmful precedent for all national companies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with problems of solvency.
It would therefore appear that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country for the stoning banner, in contravention of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the decision of Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the North Texas District left Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embarking on their property beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to enter the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the case judge reports that creditors are required to register according to the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, which is in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would be to denounce the cooperation of international proceedings in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for International Trade Law Uniformity had been created to this end by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-corporate vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by subsidiaries of Vitro to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicoan, whose Federal Institute of Commercial Faults had secured debts.
In addition, it is certain that since the voting of the subsidiaries remained, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the U.S. courts, i.e. the "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the Appeals Court.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he faced since 2008 without stopping from the serious economic crisis facing the United States, affecting the country's costs.
At the moment, the company of the family González Sada will appeal to the same appeal court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
In this case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States will call for non-prosperity and require a review of the trial by a higher court.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("a friend of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro was detailed under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that this would release it from the conventions signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, the Committee notes that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carbage of two parts: they absorb Vitro and they absorb the country.
General balance sheet
The claims of the Mexican Aviation Society's unions against the company's former boss, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, have been silent for several months, the company was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviadores has already encountered problems.
The proceeding, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values that is charged with obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has consistently refused to provide information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw fidéicommis F/589 from the bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase shares from the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They sit on the Dragon Mars
Meeting at the end of the week in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mars in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the large wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National House of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-Eastern zone to oppose the monumental project that is partly located on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to industry.
ACTA's dead.
The Government put forward a Senate requirement to explain the terms and circumstances of the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Anti-Contrafeçon Commercial Agreement, known under his English acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the Homex real estate promoter started on the market of the Stock Exchange for 500 million pesos.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basket-ball is my whole life"
The "Hetin" Reyes basketball tractor has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the land and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as big as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, a national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with the Bayamón Vacaros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I carried several helmets in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the National Team and President of the Federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a first hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basket-ball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs that recall his itinerary out of order, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Out of all his memories, the ones he loves most are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vacaros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"This has been my best years, the ones I've enjoyed most because I've had the chance to participate in eight cowboy championships since 1967, be it manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
Then I retired at the 1981 championship, the year that Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been the leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a rough player for you, it's two meters.
Do you want it?"
That's how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse was going to help us try to win another one.
He was pleased with the Vaqueros Championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the big manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of Mincy's duties and those in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't let us play the last game, Reyes said.
The 1990 World Cup is the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we razed the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze in the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there were also the young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a problem of knees.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but she gave us a gold medal and great joy during the Neuquén pre-olympic tournament in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hurruitiner replacing players suspended by the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Without a doubt, this is Piculin Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculin did.
And that does not take into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work Leo Arell does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having was one of the most glorious times of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the National Team had up to 17 teams in a season.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would have put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys only play in their area and only face teams from the other corners of the island at national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I have seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field personnel and arbitrators.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I take advantage of my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became known worldwide for the main role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a man of business without scruples, formidable and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the avalanche in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday evening from the complications of cancer, according to a family release sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, replaying the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who engaged in the role of her wife in the original series and later was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her press officer Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life in full," Gray said in a communiqué.
The doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and had recognized that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he had been detected in a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a graft.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had become known on television as an ordinary type in the "Jinny series of my dreams" broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained short on the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema are well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterly interpretation of the delicious J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS series on the Ewing clan and its relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspension around an event full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in betting.
As a result, among other things, the series reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot her.
J.R. had pregnant him and then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if he did not leave the city, but other people also had reason to assault him.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unsatisfiable man but with charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be considered an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man "great, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each one of us, who had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is under way, informed the chain.
For now, neither Warner nor TNT channel have communicated how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who celebrates the celebrity with classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scene of New York theatres in the early 1950s and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and he married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s unbeatable memories)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect him in any way," he said to the press at that time.
After his liver graft, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the restless patients.
"I advise them, I restore their trust, I come with them when they come to operate and after," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them a little comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's gonna be okay."
He was also a tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible challenge there: the end of the "great deal" of Maya calendar, on 21 December, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the impending world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what awaited him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax wretch that some called "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of time thought that the apocalypse would trigger.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé this week to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were talking about it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is evil is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will be, in theory, the last of history.
In the Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker delivered the course "Media, Culture and End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate with time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of Art and Anthropology History, have teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students need to study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the night of the end of the supposed world," Restall said.
Courses have turned out to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursery, says she has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less than one teacher, told us to believe on the day of the end of the world of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in a certain way we discredited it," says Julie zegle, a senior student in the Temple, aged 21 and originating in West Chester.
The Maya have never predicted the end of the world, this is only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I agree that there is an anxiety associated with the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he assures.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when he was asked if he knew that we were taking courses here on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a superior authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restal noted that over the years, we have talked about the many alleged dates of last judgment, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or the philosopher that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us that they were thinking of going to "the end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we're in trouble together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
