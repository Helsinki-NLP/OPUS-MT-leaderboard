Inflation in Europe has cut off on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than the forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community statistical office located in Luxembourg was reported.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Contrary to the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the direct interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with commodity price growth and lower unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "It is necessary to dissuade" inflation in order to no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 per cent is a record over the past 12 years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The market share of cereals has increased by 88 per cent and soya prices have also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 percent and, last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will fall from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent but, in 2009, it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month rate of inflation remains around 3 per cent, however, the next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the master rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance des Young Democrats) has increased significantly in early December. Thus, since 2002, it has currently had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Study Institute) has never previously found such low socialist support, 13 per cent.
For the faithful electors, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one fifth (20 percent) for the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the level of parliamentarians: their support is two percent throughout the population.
On some faithful voters to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared with the earlier low point, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been as high, it has risen to 41 per cent and by 46 per cent additional, the situation is rather serious.
After the more optimistic prospects of spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is forecast to worsen and only one tenth is forecast to improve the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of the respondents, i.e. a majority never seen in the previous Gallup surveys, found that the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of polls have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister fully and 27 percent to the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of changing political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be treated without a change of government.
While after the riots last October, 35 per cent of the polls hoped that the government and the Prime Minister would remain in office, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of intent to vote, 60 per cent of the polls replied that they would certainly vote and 20 per cent additional said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 percent of the polls would certainly participate and 15 percent additional would probably participate. Following the current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would be without doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to registration fees in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look only at the same proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote at the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital residence costs respectively.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year, unlike this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Day Economy)
This year, in the budaörs trade triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a significantly higher value than a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "who had already flown" in the large food stores last December, have not increased brutally compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are of course shocked to see that the items purchased clearly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Panier in the tested hypermarkets has exceeded 91 forints, to a minimum, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of last year, but the prices of the turkey net, walnut and peacock have greatly increased.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data from the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found only from one kilo to 139 forints.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising that, also in this hypermarket, the price of the bottle contained in two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it was only 257 forints of the bottle included.
It does not prevent that this year, in terms of Daily Shopping Cart, Auchan was the cheapest and most expensive Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the daily price of her Cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive cart and the cheapest basket this year, we find a 12 percent gap while the difference between last year's lowest and most expensive basket last year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 on average.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206, while the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noted in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has made trade perplexed, hypermarkets were unable to clearly determine what margin they apply on products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a merchant miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in the rate of VAT, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was greater than 1,720 forints to the value of the 2006 price, whereas the difference between the least expensive baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the most expensive basket value was more than 1,630 forged than last year's and the prices of the least expensive increased by 1,284 also forged.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some basic foods, the Institute of Statistics has seen an increase in prices of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the daily Panier of the latter, this seems almost absurd, since the price level of this product, which was already very expensive last year, has just increased by more than 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers hold a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in making the price increases brutally accepted by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they keep recording good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the long-contained food by pallets.
Wednesday morning important tails formed at the three hypermarketed caisses because the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain about not even reaching the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overhaul of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also make savings on disinfectants
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma service of the hospital János.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The wounded person in a serious car accident left the hospital but shortly after he had to return there because of an MRSA infection and since then doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Up to 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
It is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by methicillin-oxacilline resistant gold staphyloccus.
One third of the people are carriers of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
SA infections (such as anginas, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) are very effective for antibiotics, which are easily healing.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which respond well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged functioning of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on the elderly, small weight or with a weakened organism.
According to the director of the hospital János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital's daily routine.
Above all, you don't have to confuse the infection with the epidemic, you don't find MRSA only the one or you don't look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SA resists antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the caregivers put rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics that are suitable to treat them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling of the sample is not in mode
While the vast majority of MRSA infections may be prevented, current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, Karolina Böröcz says.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these reviews.
Most cases only see the day if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, the chief physician of the epidemiology center said.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for healing certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
The realization of microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals make the economy on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA spreads from one patient to another more often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash hands, gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient may not always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in the end of the epidemic, the patients should be removed from each other at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals in difficult financial situations save disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable manner or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government Project Against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenditures for social security funds, which is why we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs as well) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness.
The official statement on the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who resigned from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death on Tuesday, would have led to drunken or hived, communicated Friday Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Public Ministry of the Capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which had already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting on the wheel
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd arrondissement has crushed a 55-year-old man who was in front of him when he turned, with his own car, on the street Kossuth Lajos of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the passage for pedestrians.
(Moreover, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian passage is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Code of the Road a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and asked for his retirement because, according to the police report, this accident caused a lot of turmoil.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Budapest Investigations Park.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated early with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Hungarian Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed, on Friday, in Budapest, three agreements of a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line to support education, transport infrastructure and the environment as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, whose credit contract of EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties signed a €50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope first in the framework of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
In the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would recover from the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary had completed the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans not mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys on this EU market which is always the least expensive but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most invoking target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the shores of the sea, Albena, the "Sables of Gold", the "Côte du Sun", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are increasingly looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also wake up the interest of investors and they are also increasingly numerous to buy in the cheap corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, the trade and office surfaces promise the highest amortisation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive golf paradise in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The most vigilant investors already buy large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria at the same time seek to change their life, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others arrive from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally encounter many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are planning to settle are buying renovated buildings at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or from old delegated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general to the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since December, Bulgaria is cited as one of the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a medium- or long-term plus-value.
The price of capital buildings increases steadily due to an increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last five years, they have increased by 21% each year.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the communication by Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, professional meetings end on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the present time, strong discussions are being held on this subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not wish to discuss accurate figures, but they were prepared to sign an agreement on the reduction by 2020 of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent compared to the 1990 level.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, without reducing emissions, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund established by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by an Executive Board of 16 members probably under the Global Fund for the Environment of the United Nations (GEF), communicated Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its admiral ship role in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 20 per cent compared to the level reached in 1990, irrespective of the success of the signing of the 2012 Agreement, and was prepared to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time took the commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The issue is great in Bali, as the long-term international climate policy agreement must be put in place within the two-year period, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, commitments to reduce below the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the necessity of which was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which obtained the Nobel Peace Prize, to deal with climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees of celci would no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
The British army units report on the video-sharing site, records made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has been passionate about YouTube: the special units in Afghanistan are responsible for video sequences on anti-Taliban operations since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the headquarters of air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to Londres or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is indisputable
Air Force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net by this way and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and reported videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office (Commonwealth) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed on net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to inform the general public of the actual objectives of the military presence abroad.
The propaganda published by this route costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertising on television, to be communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant. On the other hand, it inevitably carries a political message as it justifies in a special form the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans played a game
The army is consumed because, apart from the videos composed and carefully censored, amateur videos have passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been made on the net presenting the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army had been packed for loading these videos only recently.
Americans recruit a little differently by using the America's Army shooting game for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in the ranks of soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and Beignets in the Departments
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking beignets and coffee.
Another department will organize a party with live music, another will enchant the officials with a tombola and will offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Celebration, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so fun the power.
Public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas celebration will be organized by the Ministry of Defence but it is not the employees of the ministry who will be invited to it.
At Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The department is planning a 25 million forint budget to create the end-of-year environment.
Compared to the other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will feast.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this feast, the Christmas atmosphere will be harsh, there will be actors and also a tomb.
The Christmas of the NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, an NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas celebration, which is organised with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, the tendering company.
The Gaîtée Theatre building was rented for this purpose.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only welcomed the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas feast, organized a ball on the occasion of the Holy Luca on December 7.
The ILO has not paid them the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome and the dinner was followed by a dance party on live music.
Answer to the [origo] question: the evening was not necessarily compulsory for this ball.
Departments of Health, Work and Local Authorities are preparing a party on it.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party to its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forks.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his collaborators to a Christmas party but to an end-of-year working meeting.
Hundreds of people are expected to be invited to have coffee and to eat beignets, provided the press service, the party will not cost more than 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his employees to have a drink in the Department of Local Authorities and Territorial Planning classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas celebration in its large hall where 436 employees are expected.
The plan is to spend 2,500 per guest, including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No planned party atmosphere, the official nature is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the hour of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas feast will not take place.
The reception will be held at the castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the City Hall, and according to the Department's communication, 1,000 per person forints are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few welcome words from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, they have communicated the respective press services to [origo].
The Ministry of the Environment's press service did not know the price of the official Christmas celebration.
However, over four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather together
The League trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will, on Friday, constitute their strike commission to coordinate the undetermined strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic jams as rail traffic will be stopped almost entirely and employees of BKV (Common Transport Company) will also be in a hurry until 13 hours.
The Unions of the League will announce, on Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Advice.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike commission will also be formed and will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the Health Fund Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on a follow-up.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Fund Act will take place only late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, important stopovers are foreseen in the traffic: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies will be in danger of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will be blocked as well.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, the list of them is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Railway Union (VDSZZZ) have not been able to reach agreement on minimum services, gold, as they approach Christmas parties, more and more are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the beginning of service until 1 p.m., the Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Syndicates of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers have called for a strike for 2 and 2 hours to 8 hours, respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims, formulated by the League, requires the Government to withdraw its proposal for health reform and to submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be set up from next year will be introduced in several stages.
The third claim wants a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would enable the system to pass the functions it deserves before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ), linked to the League's Syndicates, the Ministry of Economy and Transport's proposal on secondary rail lines and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the risk country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarszágért Mozgalom (Movement for Better Hungary) increases in several aspects the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the company reports that, in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity, the greatest political risk is that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the Hungarian and non-Tzigan population."
The research institute has added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tzigans and the Hungarians."
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened, and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, with increased attention from the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, particularly regarding confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following more publicity given to the reorganisation of the Hungarian radical and extreme right-wing groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 and have been called "national self-defense association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their members to defence missions (castarphs, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, in addition, by referring to the inability of the police, the army, in other words of the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was going through the method that, based on the political society and political parties' retaliation, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civil character and association status is therefore only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering these associations in the court but also to constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk from neighbouring relationships.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The many Roma disturbances that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
By taking advantage of these events, UNB decided to serve as a guard by saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the Tzigans have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had given rise to strong debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations on the establishment of their own custody as resistance indicates the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not rule out that Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the Telegraphic Agency, Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Policy Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
Celebrations are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays and rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we are celebrating the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, especially so that the awakeners can rest quietly.
In addition, in a year, we have eleven parties marked in red.
March 15 is a national festival, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as on October 23 as well as the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1 is the feast of work and November 1 and 2, we remember our family members and our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases or it remains only a working day before or after the event marked in red.
It is true that we pay the weekend price extended by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on days to replace days before or after holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, employees and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions which operate continuously and in service, through their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year's holidays: from 24 December, life stops almost throughout the country because according to experiences the majority of people do rather overtime or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes in order to be able to spend the days between Christmas and the day of the new year at home.
The next year a lot of holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes to working days than this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the working party to allow employees to stay in their home for four days.
On Saturday, April 25 will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24th, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six useless things that can make a terrible mistake for colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that almost catch us more: these are things that "pretty" the everyday of a place of work.
The question is whether we are accustomed to these problems or face the challenge and are consciously avoiding ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing service," said a colleague.
Did you miss an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (that is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have painful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a folder, an office tool or the phone and you don't find them anywhere.
Remember that night you put the staple on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them if they're right to be angry at you for hurting their property.
Don't get any envelopes, no post-it in your pocket because it can be drinking that there's no more and you need it right now.
You're the boss of your colleagues' privacy?
There's no good way to stop potential spreaders.
Who did what? With whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (subjects) about your colleagues' privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you calling yourself ill without reason?
When you call the office and you say you're sick on the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, think that your work, your urgent business, your missions should be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or something can happen that would make you stay at home, don't forget to warn your boss and colleagues to keep them from freaking out about you the next day.
Refrigeration, washing, telephone
You're going into your job, but your colleagues' scratching you out brutally?
Did you become, without wanting to, witness a phone discussion that you'd better not listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with colds, singing, high-voting discussions (which you carry over their heads), foot beatings, big words or discontent expressed in high-voting.
They may disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (drafting, design, organization).
Are you accusing the others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the deadline, you forget to send an important mail or message, don't accuse anyone for that forget!
Don't put it on the account of the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Admit it if you've made a mistake and if it's made any inconvenience to others, make up for it!
Ask how you can fix your fault, repair neglect!
Do you feel too much at home at the office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't suit the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by wearing nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet the expectations, you're no longer interesting
We slowly move into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm soundin'.
Music changes rhythm and bass comes to accompany the tones from all to hour, then a female choir comes to join it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts Zagar's Wings of Love song.
The Hungarian musical life has not ruined us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground slowly begin to change the overall image and, despite the new mode of the garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and played himself in the Yonderboi group before he starts on his own way, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe."
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz alloy, electronic dancing and pop music, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
The training at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the Win2 magazine cited their first album in 2002 among the fifty most important records of the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, almost the only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also compete in the west.
Zagar and his whole became unquestionably "threat" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group reacted the right way, he got a new and better disc.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new channels for them, although the title wishes to represent continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are there with the reference to flight but next to the air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real radio tube, mr2 Petõfi, which has been broadcasting recently in the morning popular music in the evening, began introducing the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
It's all right, then (?).
hvg.hu asked questions in Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube is driving me to ask a question: has your music remained a music for a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The music itself says alternatives, underground can also be poor and made only to sell them and become so commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also operates in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people of a dozen or twenty years but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, I'm glad to see that people are increasingly coming to our concerts.
However, we have never done music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the inseparable changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you'd be no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: Are you supposed to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's working alone and he's been a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even if some sometimes try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who have confidence in the other's musical presence and let them deploy.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music should be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his group and take another way.
hvg.hu: On the palmrès of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many have heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style, have you consciously opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more.
We wanted it at the end of the album to try to soften the organ of sounds and the most difficult themes addressed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a choral of the sort of gospel.
We had the idea of composing this choral of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The chorale was composed of six members: Sena, Edina Kuzora, Jude Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, who was later baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or have the girls changed it a little?
Zs.B.: This piece had been in an instrumental version for a long time and then when we composed the album, we thought something was still missing from this song.
The suite of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang at night the melody that the girls learned later.
I had it almost all right and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disc and at the concert I also thought the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of Judy Jay's solo short), they don't have a single role, they sing all together and they don't sing louder than music, so music does nothing but accompany their song.
They were behind the stage, too.
Is that what you wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute roles as a soloist.
The song also says that we must forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, just let these wings, the wings of love take us.
I wanted the others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song made you most work?
Zs.B.: Actually, nothing about the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces during mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, little by little, everything was set up as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "dropped" this disc.
At the moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader is risking billions because of his inferiority complex
A covert fraudster.
Thus, his former employee is the French giant the Company General, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost €5 billion because of it.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be regarded as incapable.
Contrary to all major banks, he acknowledged in time the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
"He's fragile," they let his superiors hear who denounced him to the police.
However, if we look at Kerviel's statement by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions have produced a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis is beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he says in the deposition.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "subprime" mortgages granted to low-income clients or to those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to €1.6 billion.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides and adds that he didn't, of course, keep nothing for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses that he has failed the reports so as not to be removed.
He managed to double his superiors, although the Eureka stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything
Was he afraid to be discovered?
Rather not.
"I thought the simple fact that I got 1.6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
Where does his will come from to risk so great?
He only gradually reached his position.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after he finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet, he knew that he would never gain as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal course," Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after his entry into office, he won his first major success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won half a billion euros by focusing on the decline of this title in the London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, you're left in peace.
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they seemed to close their eyes."
But that is when the beginning of the year comes.
It loses one billion euros in one day.
On mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the amount.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Czechia's chance to earn 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech Government signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that Czechia can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be for the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that Czech Rep can obtain in these projects.
This money will result in an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (near to 1.8 billion crowns).
But later he was released and was assigned to reside in his farm near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, depending between 1997 and 2002, will be re-incarcerated for the time being, according to the AP agency, not clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officials, or they will let Germany finish its sentence at his home, or I will be in prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Germany regularly moved government money to foreign companies accounts in Panama.
They were fictional companies and the accounts were actually owned by his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that Germany had created to fund its election campaign in 2001.
Budget adopted
That's right.
The State budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority government without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year spent a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was the Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the heated debate before the vote of the defiance declaration to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem, which, although most influential, is usually overlooked.
Here's some kind of paradox.
Whether it is desired or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although hidden behind the competition of opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why he is given more attention in the media.
Politicians are more interested in the opinion than in the shortest figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is not capable of settling at the same time:
The first being the important part given to the costs of mandates imposed by the law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" comprising the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second being a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit in the state budget that represents the largest allea.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real late bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many of the mayors often issued obligations in the wake of the collapse of their municipalities in order to obtain, apart from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they were able to repay these debts through the mass sale of the shares of distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatization.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If it is only official and verifiable, it is found that:
Our economy has already been going through for years, just like the rest of the world, a growth phase and ČSSD does not lack to sell it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their business in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that largely falls on the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programs that have, in the past few years, unfortunately needlessly engulfed.
Although some of the absurd populist spending has been eliminated, approved last year before the elections, if a gap in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and anyone will be in power, it will only be administered.
By simply exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes regular costs resuscitated by mandate costs.
The budget deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not spent as much money as they could.
If we really don't want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can spend only the equivalent of what happens to be tax and tax, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to combat the financial market crisis together.
More than a hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through a auction system, the interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
As an example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to the auctions and will provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks on 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point, to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report to the clients of the Outlook Group Economic Council.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," adds Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unrefunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still expecting other billions of losses.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still be pursued," said the Chief Economist of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
The Central Banks are concerned that, if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The Central Banks made this choice after they failed to reduce the interbank rate of Londres, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks always feared mutual loans, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and English Central Banks have declined their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Bank approach will not help to resolve the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
President Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to harm especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
This time, criticism of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ended in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is only a fusion of words, it is an erasure of solutions to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, in the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he commits himself to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, as he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
Now interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, in his opinion he had sufficient provisions to write such a book.
In fact, he is an academic who is able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics, and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes are normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they are therefore no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition to having the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he explained several times that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this subject two months ago, at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their former driving licence, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still request renewal, so that the authorities can issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permits will enter the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licence especially those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are in overcrowded by applications and the number of licence renewal applications has gone up this week.
The City Hall meets approximately 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140 OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the issue within five days.
In this case, the driver pays a supplement of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to complete the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will enter the road without a valid permit, will risk a fine from January onwards.
The culprit will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to former information, it was likely even a fine for a person who was not going to travel.
This could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is in danger of fines in tens of thousands.
According to him, the driving licence is a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
It is not like with the identity card which, it, must be valid without exception.
Persons who no longer wish to drive should return their driving licences.
It is sufficient to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
The driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also required to progressively renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the penalties for detectives with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of conjunction with David Berdych's gang, will be 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
The High Court of Prague has thus definitively sentenced them by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime were at risk for 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgement, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he does not wait until now until the verdict of first instance.
However, he has already received more than 16 years of imprisonment in other trials.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court found guilty for participation in holding-up 19 persons, the Supreme Court today dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants had, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge by claiming that it was a handled case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang returned 30 percent of the larva in Opava and Koňařík.
In the indictment, the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially, armed robbery, which in most cases has suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power by a public agent and prohibited armament.
During home searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a laser direct shooter or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang was enriched with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found other armed robbery Bertych and a whole series of other people guilty.
Other men from Berdych's neighbourhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived to the court.
For the time being, the main hearing has prevented Tomáš Pěta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision concerning their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of replacement for children: 12 million
Lawyer Igor Veleba wants to obtain a compensation of 12 million crowns plus costs from the hospital in Třebíč.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál is absolutely not in agreement with Velaba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, the claim is very high," Dostal said at the end of the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party ordered the drafting.
We'll check if it has some explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál pointed out.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family of Jabloňov demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Velaba used the expert report, written for him by the university hospital centre in Prague-Motol, as a document supporting the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological harm and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better sustained by men, although they have been faced with remorse that they have not been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, who remain less serene in the face of the current trauma and in the face of what is happening right now, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at Třebíč hospital on December 9th.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at Čermák in Přibyslave and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil, at the end of October, handed over to each of the families 100,000 crowns for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the error of the hospital of Třebíč managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czechia are obliged by law to insurance in civil liability.
In the event of failure, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
Up to now, the courts have acknowledged relatively little compensation, and the amounts calculated according to the tables were around hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (The Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Valašské království (Royaume de Valašsko) brand.
According to the Ostrava Regional Court judge, he had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, an actor's former collaborator.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will call.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitating about the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said the lawyer of Polívka after the trial.
According to him, the words Valašsko's Kingdom evoke that actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's an almost ten-year job behind us.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could benefit from it.
They want to parasit on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who used the Valašský král (Roi de Valašsko) title for the first time in his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned king by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, this had no relation to the project to set up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making passports of the Valašské Království appear.
From humorous action originally, there was a business and a lucrative business, followed by the creation by Harabiš of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature were cited in the passport and even proposed to the holders of the balances on the price of his farm visit and his theatre shows.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš made only use of the naked idea, published by Polívka in the Manéž show, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské královstvi project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the core of the project was formed by Harabiš and his team, who devoted themselves to the project in an intense manner.
The collaboration between the enemies today continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation in Vsetín for Polívka.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, who culminated with the deposition "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as the mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, calling for the court to reject today.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half the princess.
He's supposed to get a new king out of it.
He still did not want to betray the details and the date.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the king's parade in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register," said Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I mean, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, of driving and also that of manufacturing could, in many respects, be classified as an average inferior.
At present, however, there is in the market its successor, Peugeot 207, which, she, is significantly better.
Especially since the combo named SW goes one step further, I just need to think better.
When I was testing the classic touchback of Peugeot 207 I was complaining about, for example, the space for the head on the back seats.
While the complaints are over because the combined bodywork means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's go see it soon.
I'm going to mention the inside very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a very successful design, my only remark on the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a little more inventive design, as the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and when you can complain about seats or too short records is revolutionized.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in body dimensions is also sensitive there.
The combo also disappears the lack of space above the previously mentioned head.
One box in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle, therefore, is his luggage bra.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear pivot ice) and a rather easy image.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold rather heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
It makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is in relation to competition a rather average figure.
Separated the Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle in Czechia.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of Mlada Boleslav product, we can see that Peugeot remains very sensitive behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to leaving abroad on vacation or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to point out the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the box remaining after the overturning of the files of the rear seats perfectly right, or a very low walkway.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with an Otto engine of four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what should look like a 1.6 that makes family hitchback work.
It is silent, it consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the impression of having an escape pot blocked by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Travel of tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not affordable to all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a car quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 liter engine of 329,900 Kč is still valid.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
In addition to the airbags, we have automatic air conditioning, automatic winding-glasses, automatic control of the rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of account 531 900 Kč.
That's a lot, but try to add additional equipment to Fabian's price and you'll get a very similar figure.
So there's only one left to choose the mark.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is difficult
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concerns among the residents about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of people of origin turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, in which there is an increase in the number of opposing conflicts of Slovak origin, illustrates the problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Discussions, Chicane and student fights have moved into the relationship between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with racist remarks.
The police also had to intervene as a result of the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two adolescents.
The girls allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we came home, a young man jumped on the bus stop and started cracking at us.
When I told him to stop, he responded by apples and pores and then discovered his buttocks," said another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went so far as to qualify conflicts with immigrants to fight for survival.
The cases referred to above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your leave can happen if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice or intoxicating cocktails.
The kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you are not going to find this list only in its entirety, but it is rich.
But there is only one island on which you will find even more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was built at the beginning of the 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the U.S. Mafia, who had it built, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the last century's 50', were circulating on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of the whole American business show and political men left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave yourself your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita de la Havana.
In the bar of the National Hotel, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed with the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars always travel to Havana, since the jigoulis and the once imported lifes have long been in such a salty, wet climate, rotting.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green fire.
For the past 15 years, new hotels have not only moved to Havana, but especially Varader, on the coast of the Holguín province, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique to the world and will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extensive plantations in the sugars on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and this is how small locomotives, where contemporarys are not only in museums, can be seen on the way.
Where to lead his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the best known places.
So there's no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Unless you recall that in the Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Viňales in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
Exuberant vegetation grows on a limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks climb up into candel from the bottom of the valley, and, from fertile soil being caught in their guts, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is where Cuban tobacco is likely to be grown of the best quality.
You can find the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It was the trade of slaves and of sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The richness became incarnate in the beauty and character of this small city.
Koloniální španělská architecture, výrazně ovlivněná posidějšími francuzskými osadníky, čtyři staletí teměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the massive Escambray mountains, is a place so far apart that in the last century's 50's, there was no road that would link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolition anything, everyone just had a roof over their heads.
If we have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth going to see also interesting places in the surroundings, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which is excited after sunset and where music is only a little morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located on the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful one on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads there.
The two roads that take them from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without any marks of human activity.
UNESCO has registered the East Equéil de Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
There is the best chocolate, at the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in reality, it has seen the day about a hundred years after the periple of Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle-fort and the current El Castillo hotel, we see several tables, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About the café, rum, cigars, the massive Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Truries and the Island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the Holy Patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a lot of pages.
Only, as we say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment, according to the United States, has an impact on the operation of the mission to Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission to Afghanistan is not as it should, and has agreed to Edinburgh in Scotland with representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing dispute on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved today also discuss future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States called this week through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates the NATO troops to a greater extent, Britain sees the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the intensification of development assistance as a priority.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be a part of the solution.
The other being to allow people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," said British Defense Minister Des Browne at BBC.
Eighty-tenths per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to the U.S. military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in the Helmand province, south of the country.
NATO countries have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, of which almost one quarter in the South.
But, according to the United States, allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In concrete terms, they require other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap of Hoop today held similar statements.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that would take three days.
Who's Passive
The last few months also exist among the countries involved in the conflict on the issue if all the allies do indeed do in Afghanistan as much as possible.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its liabilities.
"The Germans have relatively numerous representations in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements of which they are subject are not as rigorous as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun qualified German soldiers as lazy this week.
"The hungry Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," wrote Sun in a document completed by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to counter-attack by publishing a photo of a British troop during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to one billion in 2009
The burden of a government debt exceeding 84,000 crowns lies with each Czech.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns in late September.
The government had planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
As a result of a change in state budget savings, the Department has reduced the estimated amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
So during the nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, however, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its government debt data from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns lies with each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has been indebted to more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, one could exceed the border of a billion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion crowns," said the Analyst of Patria Finance David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of the analyst for Next Finance Vladimir Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the billion by the year 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the political situation was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed by 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he said.
Debts Grow
The debt of the State consists of central government debts and is mainly generated by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government's debt is financed by securities from the treasury, securities from the rent, direct loans or, for example, from loans to the European Investment Bank.
The State's domestic debt has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the negotiable State reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average exigency of the government's debt was 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased internally from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is, in view of the current health of the economy, too high.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the rental securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be material to negotiate when pension reform comes," commented the Pikora data.
Better than expected
It follows from the government's 2007 debt financing and management strategy that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, due to a change in the state budget's budget's budget's best, the department has reduced the estimated amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum consists mainly of the government budget deficit, which clearly goes to 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the initially planned 91.3 billion crowns.
Second, these are the maximum sources provided for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion for pension payments, the financing of state-run securities for 43 billion crowns, and the repayments of the European Investment Bank loans of 1.8 billion crowns.
She was comparing today to a court in Khartoum for having appointed a bear in wiring
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced on Thursday evening by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and the expulsion, his lawyer said.
The British was accused of having let 6-7-year-olds name a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was liable to a beating sentence.
This 54-year-old British institute in office at the Khartoum High School Unit in the Sudan was arrested on Sunday and charged with targeting Islam and secession, pursuant to article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from students' parents from the Ministry of Education.
In fact, the story goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class wig bear.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the classroom, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher in the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", he said that it was only an "innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many students of the institute who describe it as "very careful to his students" and "who never speaks of religion in class".
Let us recall that the first name Muhammad is also the second most named name in Britain, he writes in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules for the use of this first name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
Of course, this is a question of interpretation.
They failed to reach agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, I fail.
On Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, the Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion without overcoming their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," said the European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “in play”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to abide by their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence in the immediate future, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, according to which "excellent pressures exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province populated by 90% could become clearer when Ishinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the Troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation to be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of U.S. administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina says she is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not agree in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement was found," announced the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where these "negotiations of the last chance had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that Belgrade's self-government plan "belonged to a past that led to killings and deportations."
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, considered that a compromise was always possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said, among other things, that a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the delegation of Serbia had insisted that any decision should be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian Allies had a veto.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be "in consultation" with the West.
Bush strikes out an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the International Peace Conference held in Annapolis on Tuesday, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to engage immediately in negotiations with a view to finding a final settlement of the settler 60 years old between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonization activities, said Bush, reminding both parties of their obligations under the "roadfire" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This appeal covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the conflict in 1948.
Speaking after the President of the United States, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In turn, Olmert committed himself to making future talks "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for the implementation of his co-existence of two Palestinian and Israeli "State Vision".
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in the direction of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saud in his interview with Saudi-capital Arab daily.
The police are not responsible for the prosecution.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
Like every time in this type of fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the survey of the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was operating on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, Louise-Michel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and it circulated at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophary", explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, therefore not allowed to travel on the public road" (read below) and piloted by two young people without helmets, circulated "very lively".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right," said a police officer.
Alcohol control over the occupants of the vehicle proved negative.
The state of the car (formerly broken, star-like windshield, bumphead) attests to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assisted persons in danger" to the IPGN, which was busy with the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGNI investigation at this stage was disresponsible to police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a sort of scratch, probably caused by the rustling of the stairways on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were kept closed as long as the police car gets to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, that police officers would have left the places very quickly, thus not providing assistance to the two young people.
The IGN, while being careful, would also rule out "all serious errors" concerning this point.
"It is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which to be very careful," said a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness of these few moments who followed the accident.
One of his windows giving exactly on the stage.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, trying to raid them, he said.
There was nothing to be done."
He then saw "a completely feudish cop, who was boxing.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the tension that soon surrounded the scene, and it seems to be the certainty that the people who were present about the unexpected situation of young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the place.
According to this witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let you say that police services have not provided assistance to young people.
These young people were after all.
Firemen arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out on his side.
The tension is rising in Pakistan
The Pakistani police suppressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who were protesting against the emergency measures were injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement forces, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, hurting police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were called in.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers have charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court Bar Association lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of some 500 arrests during the week-end of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other events would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of religious parties grouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president '' exhorted the people to send flowers to the judges who have pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and debris to those who have sworn before Musharraf''.
'' Musharraf's promise no longer holds''
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly covered by the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
It was due to take action in the coming days on the legality of the reelection to the presidential office on 6 October at the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was defeated and replaced.
''All that we are witnessing is illegal, anti-institutional and contrary to the judgments of the Supreme Court,' said the magistrate in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president 'holds more' after the state of emergency, said on Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
To abandon his military uniform was due by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani Government denied the country's insistent rumors that President Musharraf was assigned to residence by his Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not expected, it reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwireth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, the Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception has also enabled a better "fecundity mastership", according to the Institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
See calculated next month for a couple of five and if possible in spring, season considered as the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours of work in space to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crews at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel, which is essential for the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky release that has accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, the tools "brickled" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday as astronauts had unloaded the Discovery shuttle from the Harmony module, a large cylindrical room to welcome European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a kind of docking for the modules-laboratory.
But we must be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module by solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to place it on its final position.
After moving, the crew began to redeploy solar panels from the module with a width of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the signs, which unfolds like accordions, was damaged about a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to carry out a check-out of the Discovery shuttle, then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracle at the end of 30 meters in length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
This is one of the best "spacewalker" of the Nasa.
Great, resistant, very neat, it has the torso very developed and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was charged with "acting" the "stricken" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he sectioned the faulty cable and installed kinds of "attacks" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" that remained close to his own and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped with insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "brickled" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying its tools and returning the station's interior.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of half a day's relaxation before today, seven astronauts did not return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to the planned Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS Awarded in the Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently falling at the Paris stock market, after the aircraft and defence group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its expected operational result for 2007 as a result of the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which will condition the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost to compensate for the delay in delivering its military aircraft, announced in October, is 'EUR 1.2 billion to EUR 1.4 billion of which more than 1 billion for Airbus', announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be required to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results on Thursday, it adds without more quantified details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the delay of six months.
As a reminder, the operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspension, on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
At three days' legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a television message on the public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as the head of the Russian list together, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is announced to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President left nothing to be transpired by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely to carry a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of real democracy and we want honest elections, the most transparent and open elections, without any accruals," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
She denounces a campaign under pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there were "never such dirty elections, even at the time of Eltsine".
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, the former champ of the chess world Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these non-suspendless legislations are two more open questions:
- Who's next in Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential, on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot fight a third consecutive term.
But no successors emerge.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The head of the parliamentary majority and of all powerful Russian party united who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, to the legislatures as well as to the presidential, the power that emerges will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Soviet homo, they do not feel master of their destiny," said Sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes further: civil society has slowed down in this Christianised country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more that this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "responsibly renounce personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
“What do you want to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 heads of Russian regions) running the local lists of Russia united.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
Nor will the Russians vote for extremists on behalf of the Russians.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "What do you want to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored within 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen, Hesse, were so far accessible only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e., individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or his entitled.
The 11 states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratifying this agreement by all States has been completed, and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers," says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, had opposed the opening to the public of these nominee documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to give them proof of their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Mr. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the University of Berlin Technische Universität in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, indo-European bilateral trade already reaches almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008 indicated the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given their green fire to the European Commission in April to enter into negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
"A free trade pact is a great deal of both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants trade annually for "EUR 47 billion of goods" and for "EUR 10 billion of services", said this week Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India are meeting Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England called itself Thursday concerned with alleviating the current return of credit concerns, and announced a ten billion pound offer at the basic rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusually long offer.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty as to how they will organise their liquidity positions over that period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its reserve contribution for the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she says in a communiqué.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time BoE seems to have placed cash on the market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These normally take place within a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that it "will be ready to take other measures to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on a day-to-day basis with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has been 6.6% higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England's market amounts have been accompanied by an important penalty rate that had deterred banks from using them.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the book price over the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank at more advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist Bill on Purchasing Power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text on Thursday.
The text was included in a socialist "nice" (season at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office, including a 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a cheque-transport or rent management.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was lifted following the general discussion which resulted in exchanges, sometimes vivid, between a majority and a few hours' opposition to the television intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
Following numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the UK producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with someone who has, no less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival is expected to be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres to approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989, he took up the bar of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury of the "most inspiring event" to which he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"Our planes choose Philadelphia as a market and work together with Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we've been involved in politics because of the current administration, followed by Charlie Jones.
"We were able to talk with Melvin Benn and we were ready to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the population of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after starting in the festival landscape in 2002 with Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours take place in urban green spaces," said Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a rural festival to the European and urban region in America."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, strongly supports the holding of this event," said Charlie Jones.
He refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but says "that they are interesting enough to allow us to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people from Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been made to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of the press.
"Vineland will taste rock, but music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
Its partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Award Promoter from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film trays in Montreal when no other Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegation's duties.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the governor's legs?
"We must be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll be there.
Our role is to offer those they will judge best," he says.
The festival race
For now, Denis Turcotte's priority is, however, the promotion of cinema here.
The Oscars race started.
It will be of all the festivals of the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end stock exchange rally? Experts divided by the subprime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands, waiting for the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not as certain that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, statistics-based forecasts should not be made, since given the current context, uncertainties are based on markets, at least on the short term."
Although they are not supporters of the stock exchange to take stock over the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is fed through the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of leakage to quality values both in long and short periods."
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the probable decrease in Fed rates, given the high gross level and the danger of inflationary tension stimulation"
Javier Barrio, head of sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," the expert assures.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost almost 4% since November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this vision so negative.
Juan Solana, Analyst of Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be slightly different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the festival of the Constitution (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, Analyst of Investment Bank, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be caused by information from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, from Investors Bank, ensures that the increases will be from the bank and industry.
Manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, in the event they get into it.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
cyclical consumption will be a protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological enterprises will do so as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only two occasions in December has been a month's kisser.
The genuine year-end rally took place in 2003, during which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the perception of the technological bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of the gains (for the moment Ibex has increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and if it succeeds on the computer on its end-of-year rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices from Monday to Saturday 12 hours
The People's Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it was the first group that decided to start bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m. and to open on Saturday from 10:00 to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the hours of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not this initiative that coincides with trade schedules.
This is precisely the goal that the People's Bank seeks.
Attract the autonomous customers who travel around these areas to make their purchases in the SMEs and the street trades chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies implemented throughout Spain in about 18 months, as it is not the opening of new agencies but a renewal of existing ones.
For this, the organization will modernise the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colours.
The bank trade manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not involve large investments, but hire staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as explained by Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets to be chosen, and with success, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who work under the brand of Mundocredit, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies, they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
' We do not want to compete with our customers ', notes Rivero.
For the moment, they reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock exchange of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegate advisor to Telecinco, yesterday expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect was tarnishing his joy: 'what hurts me, it's not the fact that we've increased but that we're less down,' he said.
However, he emphasized that on a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished last day with a 2.54% increase.
This win has stabilized its loss to 15.66% for a year.
The value in the Mediaset-controlled company stock exchange (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who resigned yesterday 1.52% and has accumulated a fall of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies in the Stock Exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Five Days) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Anenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of hearing.'
Telecinco announced last week that he planned to become the first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, the delegate advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order to make this data true, the television channel should record an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year for the current fiscal year.
For its part, the net billing of Antwerp 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution of Telecinco in the stock market is the important pay out he has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría has distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
" We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is currently giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profits estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and 2009, to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decrease in expected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast of earnings from Antwerp 3 to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and to 7.5 per cent in 2009.

In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of Congress on amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts of Members of Parliament and senators to negotiate and consent to the best regulation able to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the organization's activity for the effective functioning of the markets.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, implies the modernisation of financial markets, at the time it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) and promotes cooperation among the various EU leaders.
The new regulations will enable financial consultation services to be provided both for specialized social reasons and for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and international order systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management, and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they perform, in order to facilitate control by the NCMV.
By way of the Congress Economy Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which shows that the debt held will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has demonstrated itself with what happened with the high-risk (subprime) US mortgage debt.
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of management to legally delineate the functions that graduates in the Economy may be 30 years after, in 1977, it was approved, the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its services to market products and attract new clients to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which serves after Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy by providing comparable data in time and in quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information on which it is not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
"The CPI will continue on relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in CPI in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has stated in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain on monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We expected a figure around 4%," recognised the Minister of Economy as compared to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock deposits have dropped to more than 50% up to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit with the Bank of England.
At that time, he had some record deposits over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that was gradually dropped in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of the money that the Government offered and that it would maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would name the organization with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to enter around one quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get these 18,000 million books left until reaching the target of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson Group, known for its advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock has appointed this week the offer of the Virgin Association, which participates in three other companies, including his favorite to save him from the bankroute.
The Mayor of Totana was arrested for a plot of alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard today, at the beginning of the morning, arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council's secretaries and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the Moo of May last Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councillor of the mayor, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'minor' of this plot.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Council and the possibility of further arrests in the coming hours is not allowed.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Chain to the lawyer of the MP 'of the Popular Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving the home of Morales with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
Moreover, according to sources of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged incumbency of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight persons in detention.
Bono accepts to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Tolede and preside over Congress if they win the elections
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the leader of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Tolede for the next general election and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus, the secretary of organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference following the meeting that took place this afternoon at the headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and "Bono is among the best".
In addition, he pointed out that "yes it seems" that La Manche's political man will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside over Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made his decision on 15 November last to not go to the next general elections and to abandon his political career to focus on the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political front since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that even though citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress in an "transparency act".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the Chamber into "a house of respect rather than an insult or a cry" and to make it "more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where we cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know how to do" and he did not want to do as if he already occupied his position to not fall, as he pointed out, in what his adversaries might regard as "a domination".
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subjected to an unmerciful persecution of both the sceptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach forces him to explain why his Government's action or inaction has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leadership of the European Union in the failure to implement the Kyoto Protocols.
Those responsible for the non-implementation, in which sectors it has occurred and why its Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what people's habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will have to do, what economic consequences this will cause.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and pay to save the planet.
But there was no, and there will be no explanation.
Especially because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costy, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Until the hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so mentally dangerous in Zapatero that he rushed to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for the electoral campaigns that he does not speak, who does not denounce and does not require, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to a purely virtual contracting party that does not claim to be travelling on a bicycle or refreshes us with the range.
The mayor and chief of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the Mayor and a suspicious hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the City Hall, where many officials met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Councillor of Urbanism and the Municipal Management Company of the Sol Industriel and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but they are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Totana Tribunal No. 1 instructs.
The first six prisoners have been brought to justice today.
According to sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently an autonomous parliamentary officer of the PP party, Juan Morales, is covered by the investigation.
In addition, the former woman, the owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancee of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcie.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A. were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine-pots would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Opérative Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcie, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
As a result, only one person was arrested in Totana, in sum, the owner of a very well-known poultry company in the region, which could have played an intermediate role.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 accommodation, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land that had been requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are responsible for the promotion of real estate; Conycasse, which manages the parking lots of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us the comment of yesterday published in Finland's most important newspaper (some in the head of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day he appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course brought public opinion to the fore as a result of the tragedy of Jokela school.
The guilty of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Professor of Education in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and said that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools."

A colleague passes information on the introduction to the Criminal Code on Internet Downloads:
A. The downloading of a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered to be a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Flight to a store for up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than the one imposed for the download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and give it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the one imposed for the download (an article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous fight implies a three-month-to-one-year sentence (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the traffic of CDs would involve a six-month-to-two-year sentence
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on foreign research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less '.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted thanks to magnetic tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for the neurocognition images of the Institute Life&Brain, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when both individuals found that they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, activation was greater.
I do not know whether this conclusion would require so much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla is angry with a bitter taste, because the leading leaders of Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead -, the former general Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are in this list, whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes his title, 'the Carla' list (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who continues the criminals on the run and exerts pressure on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible loss, implies an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the driver's driving licence, the civil condition, the type of vehicle to be ensured or the use in fact, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which takes into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of driving licence, civil status, the type of vehicle to be ensured or the use in fact, among other things.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
For this reason, people over 25 years of age and women must pay lower premiums, since statistics show that they have a lower rate of damage than in their care.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency and therefore the probability of an accident.
Increasing the frequency of probabilities increases.
They are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages at the time of making an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as the low driving experience and the old driving licence.
Although the ideal to be secure is a risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most expected drivers can opt for any risk insurance with freeness, so that they get coverage of insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the client pays part of the disaster amount.
"The part of the loss of the customer will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage to third-party persons, but for those caused by his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A council.
If you are a 25-year-old, try to be careful and avoid the damage to the extent possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the insurance price in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to increase the bonuses," Noguera says.
Beyond the age of 25 this becomes easier for drivers at the time of a contract with insurance, as the rate of loss is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
This is why it is preferable to choose any risk insurance with frankness.
"Youth can't normally take advantage of the experience previously acquired after an accident," he assured the director of the European company in Spain and added that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'novice' fear has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at any risk, as soon as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as people with the lowest rate of loss, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk-free insurance (can be EUR 300), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed conduct and they have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchises," Justice Luis Noguera.
For retirees, an insurance at all risk with franchise is preferable (in the case of 150 euros), or an extended third party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible loss, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that is most appropriate for us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth finals
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow measure next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in closing the league of the Champions, as it serves Italians to be first and Scottish to be classified.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a null match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that the Shaktar Donetsk, who has six, receives Benfica who has four, does not pass it ahead of him.
These two games of Group D will be played one week before the sixth day ends, since the Milan AC will have to fight the semi-finals of the World Cup Clubs in Japan on 13 of this month in search of a place for the final of 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at stage Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at their homes and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it will remain first and will ensure a better crossing in the eighth finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be sufficient to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't be able to computer only on this, since with nine points the game returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
For example, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope to rank for the eighth finals for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rosoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case Celtic would lose, to rank for the eighth final in order to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although last and without the opportunity to continue the European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group broke down in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) reported shortly before starting their concert at the PM Place stage in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the story of the group that became angry at the end of 1990 was told.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main success as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of Spice Girls came up on stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he'll think about the show."
' Sporty Spice ' which is part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," said Chisholm on the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that with time, "the things have been arranged and we appreciate it very much."
But a lot has changed since Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special flight from Virgin Airlines.
Upon their arrival at the airport, an army of babysitters were waiting for them.
They count to her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be exhibited in California, USA, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will show in Madrid on December 23rd.
The new gas business between Russia and Ukraine is launching the alarm.
A debate on the price of gas fermented between Ukraine and Russia, thereby increasing the risk of impacts on exports of fuel to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.E) are driven by pipelines, and each pipeline is carefully monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came after the Ukrainian and Gazprom government, a Russian-owned monopoly company providing gas, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices in Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts stated that this would involve, for Ukraine, a 40% increase in the cost of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," announced the Ukrainian Minister of the Economy, Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters press agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major exchange between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies for Ukraine.
This has led to the fall in exports to Western Europe, thereby increasing prices.
The Russian gas represents one quarter of the supplies of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the controls to be carried out on its non-Community employees to check for previous criminal offences, said the Control Committee.
The warning of the General Revisor, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no specific data on the number of overseas people it employs.
Its report has also highlighted other decisive controls, which are properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The reviewer-general carried out checks on outside Community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, a doctor of Iraqi origin in the service of the Royal Alexandra de Paisley Hospital, was arrested at the airport after being buried with his jeep, at the doors of the main terminal.
He was part of the three doctors who were filmed in the Old Bailey in October, as they were suspected of being involved in various attempts to blow up cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal controls, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the reviewer's report now states that the committees are required to confront the Office of Control of Previous Criminals, thus enabling employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some information about staff has been well verified, this is not done at all." states the report.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment controls it would do itself, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls can identify employees who may commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment controls currently carried out, work well in the Scottish health system, and it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities said they employed 1161 overseas people, made up of most doctors and nurses.
But the reviewer-general pointed out that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems with the identification of staff with indeterminate term contracts, which could choose to remain in our country or not.
The investigation showed that the current procedures of health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are quite appropriate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its pre-employment policy and control system for staff outside the ocean of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, linked to health committees, would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report to be issued next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, and valid for all employees, including overseas people.

The 50-year-old director, who shot films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the suite of Indiana Jones, The Crystal Cranium Kingdom.
Winston said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of the star Harris, a protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admiring in front of this great current actor, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "the Bifas" are attributed by a jury composed of stage gauges, actors and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia Block 208 Terrifying Plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells operating an imminent attack on a oil site, as well as attacks on the clergy and the armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smuggler cells.
Al Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the United States-allied monarchy since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on a oil site in the Eastern Province, said the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoted a statement by the Minister of the Interior, said that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has infiltrated the country.
The militants were said to plan against the eight-missile band in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appear to have completed the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The government asked the clergy to do more against the Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda's militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Shiite government allied to the United States, considered to be heretics according to the tough line of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by the appeals against the Saudi pro-West government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on State television.
Among the prisoners, 16 members of the Medina are organized into a "media cell" to promote "takfiri thought", the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unfaithful andposted Muslims.
Of the prisoners, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the militants.
Venus' climate could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
Data from the European ship in orbit showed that the planet is certainly two times smaller than the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planet on Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and might even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, air erosion due to solar radiation coupled to a slower rotation has led Venus to a different kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface enough to melt the lead.
The discovery of Venus Express, the European Space Agency probe, which studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor of the Department of Physics of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand why Venus' climate is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface."
Uranium enriched by the police.
One kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was abducted by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons were arrested and that the equipment is currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£450,000).
Again open to everything
Mitt Romney said he did not stand up as a candidate for the presidency to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican candidates for the presidency have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as that of another debate of You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position in relation to the warming of the planet.
But this time, the questions and the answers have reflected a great deal about the conditions of the Republican party, who is a candidate for the next elections.
We don't know what criteria, CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The registrar noted increases in approval when the candidates spoke crudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is in the lead of the important anticipated elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his mandate as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of using illegal immigrants in his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when they were asked whether they would be willing to promote an "amnesity" (offering regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen to the clandestines).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this subject.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, may be due to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and more incisively than others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for clandestine immigrants.
This subject, coupled with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears of the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water into the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not about believing the story of Jonas and the whale.
Another intervener asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee was not expected to be seen in a recent election in Iowa, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, to say that the death penalty is painful as much as necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to appear in the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's resurgence in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious search for subsidies by libertarian Ron Paul, and the suffrage during the Wednesday debate.
These two are emerging from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two protected parties are unable to agree to decide who is the most well-known and more traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party of good time and convincingly thanks to a successful message about American greatness thus bringing leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to shade; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, it is not particularly juridical.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills of politicians, no Swiss extra-marital foot finger.
But here's a revelation that a rich businessman would have hidden for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to over £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have passed well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister took a step backwards in his draft election, insulting the British intelligence stupidly proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrible Mr. Brown has transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's purchase, a bank in difficulty on board the crack, demonstrated a failure of directives and poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for the change of the tax code led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative bourde.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, Protestant against reductions in military spending: they proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of crazy donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Workers (and his former chief of vigilance) led them to resign.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is heading unmistakably toward the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but usually leave their doubts aside when a new government arrives in power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are making the record; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast to be a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and the tax data, for example, are related to Mr Brown's decisions when he was a Chancellor of the British treasury.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's woes, such as the long investigation into the funds of the party's "money counting for the members of the House of Lords", voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown's difficult situation is not so tragic that she does.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories Party make him believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to realize Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies forever, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal about political donations is a good example.
Abrahams, a very special character, who compared his donations to charity, said he did not wish any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big subsidisers of politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, not knowing that this was illegal, should therefore be questioned, as did Jon Mendlesohn, the person responsible for the collection of grants that had spoken of dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown has not been involved: nothing suggests that he has been aware of these steps, even though most payments have been made as a result of his arrival in the government in June.
So far the prime minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on a familiarity with it, making use of an inquiry committee on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been broken, it's from the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent president for the Independent Committee of the Standards of Public Life, without leadership for six months, and preparing for a good reform on the financialization of political parties.
This would require the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead him to renounce his special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservatives' party now has a good advantage for the elections; he has two years to regain the voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see noodles drawn around, to soak around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit cards market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the rates of costs and insolvency, which measures the shares of the unrecoverable balance sheet or are more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly due to the weakness of card carriers.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvabilities are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly due to technical factors.
A change of laws in the United States in 2005 regarding personal banking resulted in an abrupt fall in banker archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to settle.
and confidence in the security of the capital of credit cards is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the 2007 emissions volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct linkages between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate borrowings have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species than to the value of heritage, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily result in a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to repair everything.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with greater flexibility to such crisis conditions as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of actions.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and reassess all borrowings." said Gary Perlin, Capital One Director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal swimmers..
British bankers plead guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by the former financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their statements, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of the seven charges for alleged collusion fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are scheduled to appear at the courthouse in January.
But during a hearing chaired by American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous all over Britain because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding question for this investigation, which was launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 indicated to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation in the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, known as the "three of the Natwest" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him call the banking procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank considered its interest in the subsidiary to be null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the subsidiary's bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 in Kopper as an interest in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The charges indicated that the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endured a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1 million security, which requires them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, in banking in December 2001 after years of accountancy, could no longer hide his billion debt or even propose his biden speculations as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of redundancies, over $60 billion in market value loss and over $2 billion in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were futile because of his death as a result of a heart attack last year.
Not in, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats since it is more than a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the stand in Gulfstream, last Friday, at the Millionaires Salon, an orgy of consumer incitement, for four days, which is held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new Russian rich for their varied products, ranging from yachts to cars filled with diamonds such as 50 cents.
Mr. Firer searched a bright orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"it's a pretty car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private airline market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such Dallas"
"We experienced the same in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar of the Davis department of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University."
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the largest global expenditures.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has $53 billion worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are generally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the economic and financial research centre.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, which is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London jeweller.
She participated in the trade show for the first time with the Russian distributor, The Bijoutier Group of Soho.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the living room, Sunday night, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare to be like their customers, millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who seized her high-cut dress such as a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The living room seems to be mainly aimed at the new wealthy, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to make the tail in the caps to come up to a huge warehouse where the Cadillac Escalades are exposed, platinum cannips, Mövenpick glaciers, personalized billiards tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund stuff bears are exposed.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, proudly seated at the Royal factory stand for the manufacture of Dutch Delf porcelain, in front of a wall painting by Raimbrant on blue tiles, handy.
"it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers here stated that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too much in line with Russian standards) have already passed out of the logos that burst into a kind of limited-edited brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, be they millionaires, millionaires or tourists, hang the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he had sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton embedded with gold wires.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips the cars with last cry alarm systems, also told him that he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday after noon, Andrei Karaptian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalises luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded in Swarovski crystals to look like a wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of mason leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be millionaire, at least on paper, if it's not in question," he said.
"there are more than you could think about it"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has erected four stands representing the British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers stopped to launch masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire," said Mr.Karyev.
Unauthorized surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was the night before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking through the window bay of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observing an ambulance that had just stopped at the White Cape Cod's doors on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrives.
and then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Livingston, a restaurant manager on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased person was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unaccredited cosmetic surgeon, who the police have not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they are waiting for reliable results of the toxicological tests which, unfortunately, will take some time, but which should allow for the resolution of this mysterious death that saddened the high levels of the Newark police.
Melle Arroyo was the assistant director of the police, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacious," McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"it was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Drink Control Commission, and that she left two sons 14 and 11 years old, and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesperson for Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo died from unauthorized surgery.
"It is a possibility to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities said they had arrived at her home about 15 hours ago.
and found Melle arroyo on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has gone by since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh was unable to confirm whether Melle Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical firm.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Melle Castro's house, where a sunflower lay in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian poured down the back.
A blue canon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a replacement for vanilla in kitchen and for perfumes, was lying in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two bicycles all ground on the sides.
McCarthy stated that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Department of Police, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him to sail to the new city and to abandon his framed political culture.
"She said, "You must pay attention to this," he said.
"She was there when I got there, and still there when I left.
"It was embarrassing."
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rate of global stock exchange.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit conditions, thereby further reducing the interest rates promoted by the reassuring statements of the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets under way.
In an obvious effort to reassure the irrefutable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence in part "has reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market late September and October.
In the event that this severe turbulence was to persist, it would increase the likelihood of a subsequent rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped to calm Wall Street with even worse news about the US economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was exacerbated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, i.e., 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate the heavy losses due to the losers in real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55 per cent to 13.289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65 per cent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165,5 points, or 2.7% to 6306,2 adding more than 39 £ to the value of British companies.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the re-appearance of credit difficulties in markets has been highlighted in response to the strong demand for a sale of monthly three-fund auctions from the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Presses on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject additional funds into London financial markets resulting from credit tensions have led to high rates of three monthly borrowings "Libor" the British banks have caused their highest growth since September last year, to 6.59% following a high rise since November 12.
England faces a call for judgment against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be drummer #6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the President of the Selection Officers who was exceptionally there to help Peter Moore, Chief Coach, and Michael Vaughan, the Captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President General of England, begins to complete the application forms to become a national selectr, at least in part time.
The one who will not succeed in winning the n°6 backyard will be bad, but life is often unfair and sport is also bad.
It is never easy to delete what allows a man to arrive at the top of his profession while another will never arrive beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than due to lack of ability.
There is only one thing in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time for Bopara to emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubeby"; both, new executives having good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricket unless at least one chance is granted?
Figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricket one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 to the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's gonna play at Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful rounds, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also fought to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary cricket of the Test, and that despite the fact that his double cent marked against Australia in Australia can still be estimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya stage, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning at the innings of the 88 test in Bombay, 32 cents of first class compared to six for Bopara, who at 22 years is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only made ten rounds during his two innings against the Caribbean in May during the Test in Lord, his city of player of the Middlesex, and that, the immediate rejection by the pickers when Vaughan again in form, demands his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is full of joy of living.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently hit a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, a sponsor of England.
He deferred only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at him from a distance, to ask him if "had he seen this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his bright spinning allows him to do services that go to him, and he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Can this be the real art of the selection?
I would be willing to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and to fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, diverting these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hoped that the city had found normal.
Some have come back to combat militants who have distanced them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported to dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who came back by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and since the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to go away for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the area of Amariyah dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented the Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia in Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-aid militia, allowed Al Qaeda to be hunted west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of the new arrivals of Jordan is the head of a tribe of Sunni and Shia who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of an attack on the grenade after he urged the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back and fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I come back today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Oeidi.
Many say that they have attracted the increasing calm of the capital since the American troops arrived, and in view of continuing formation of well-armed "groups of citizens" and working with American military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline in the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three children, expressed suspicion of everyone about visas for exiles that Nuri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit their entry into the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country because of death row squadrons.
"We didn't have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to no longer give Iraqi visas, to force them to return to Iraq," said retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence may be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been expelled from Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will not further increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest Federated State conducts vocational training, and even shines from the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in an area where there is a deficit on the Sarrois, similar to that on the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - it's the slogan that the smallest Federated State, by self-deed, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics of Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies by a double, or even a triple degree.
This shows the high rate of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the country's children to higher schools in numbers above the average - many of them without a degree from Gymnasium.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people get their degree at a vocational school, so Sarre is at more than seven points above the national average.
Therefore, the possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Sarrois Education has forced schools beyond a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests in the entire federal state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of school is free of law - a model that in the meantime other Federated States also copy.
Only future comparison studies can show whether the performance of students improves in a sustainable manner.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other Federated States.
The Bavarians are getting better.
And despite sarrois, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by the PISA studies - otherwise we could gain points in this area.
Because the neighbor's language is compulsory in high school - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez sets the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon do tic-tac other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will remount the half-hour timer in the South American country.
Chavez in time becomes a cartoon in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated it, by means of a new law, the watches will be settled at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, due to a hostage affair.
The Nationalist on the left announced that, as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he would not have relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do that, because of my dignity," Chávez said, who is looking for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw from Chávez the negotiating mandate regarding the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "broken to the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Chávez Sunday.
In Spain too Chávez is in all mouths.
A new mobile phone ring is annoying in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (because you don't like it) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the Internet.
She was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant appeals of the left populists and who told her to shut up.
Germany was threatened by a decline in wages in 2007.
Despite the strong conjuncture, according to one forecast, a true undervalue of the salary threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault is due to low wage development, increased value added tax and rising food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economics and Research on the "Bild" newspaper.
New charges could also be made for unemployment insurance for the employee.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Nue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected fall in unemployment insurance by 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the words of the SPD politician.
It was noted on Tuesday that the explosion of food and hydrocarbon prices had increased the rate of inflation at its highest level for 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, similar to those appearing in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are flashes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today has provided evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus explode at a height of about 56 kilometres of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to Cyprine's famous theory, the lightnings would have revealed life on Earth: anger would have triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, an angle stone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If life had been there, it must have been at a very old date of history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be little living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Vénus is perhaps the infernal twin of the Earth, but she remains a twin," said Russel.
Why Venus, which resembles the Earth so much in mass and dimension, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venetian research, since no more probes were on the way to exploring this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only highlight Venus' singularity within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than supposed to be at first sight.
So the researchers found, in addition to the windflakes already known at the north pole, a cloudfly at the south pole, which turns even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the hemispheres of the Earth in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Institute of Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica italiana.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 km, almost as large.
The planet qualified as a star in the evening or in the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: a Venetian day lasts 243 days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly remembers the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have formed under similar conditions.
Of the two, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has fixed itself on Earth in the form of carbonate, it is on Venus the largest part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's encounter with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for the end of the party's quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs because of the attacks against the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and I think the great coalition to close the quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler said at Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, underlining the President of the Federal Republic, but defending Merkel against the complaints that it would organize a new policy in China.
The German Chancellor did not take her distance with the traditional policy of one China.
"China also knows," Köhler said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the "provision policy" of the CDU in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese government not only ordered the Minister of German Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel's information, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the ministers of foreign affairs in both countries.
The head of the Chinese government Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the reception of the Dalai-Lama was a mistake.
China refuses European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, supported Wen Jiabao as well as the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that it tries to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots such as those in France.
Street fights with police, shootings, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not explode in the streets by violence, the Minister of the German Interior has demanded.
Burning barricades, cassers who pull on the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive does not form in our homes as well and breaks down into violence.
We need to take this seriously," he said to the "Nue Presse" who appeared in Hanover.
All young people would not be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federated States and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end of warning.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems, not from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had been engaged in serious street fights with the police during the last few nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater efforts to integrate the German Government, that is what the President of the Turkish Communities required in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of immigration would be higher than the average.
First of all, more places for training should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish Communities added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also don't want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must still be careful."
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
In the meantime, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flew over the area with headlamps.
The authorities in office reported three arrests, as well as a few burned cars and trash.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has ensured calmness.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announcing the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the disturbances overwhelmed Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sundays.
According to the first elements of the Park, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The utopia entry of the chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the bottom - and that there is nothing to wait for from it.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After his sad intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and content-poor, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of being too focused on politics was pushed by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
This is provincial, she said and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it clear to all how accurate this reproach was.
There was no real interest or feeling in the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a policing politician, who fled into foreign politics and even stayed there quietly.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it still welcomes and still welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even, the praise of oneself - having too little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now it cramps with all-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
This way she destroys her image of pragmatist, who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the clouds of Angela, the problems of domestic policy are marginal.
Poverty in children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases left for this.
In this regard, the number of times it lapses when it comes to family allowance is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three startups to give a specific half sentence.
She's lying in unknown ground, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican candidates to the Chair, the two Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney favors engage in a hard offensive battle - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of candidates has already exploded on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the clandestines," complains Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The one against his side with heavy reproach: "I would say his own house was a home for illegals" answered Giuliani and blamed the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates attack: since the Republican base does not have any official favors, the eight candidates for the presidential office use debates on CNN first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
"It's with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," John McCain throws his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly taught by Vietnam's veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates the drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go from time to time beyond the war in Iraq to debate on torture is seen in the reactions of St. Petersburg's joint hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, applause is deferred in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favors are found again.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney, "complaining his excuses to the base and the television audience for having been still a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, went through a flowing knot when asked for his opinion on literary interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilians.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the army, the man of Pakistani power Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus, eight years of military domination end.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had transferred his post as Chief of the Armed Forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus taken care of international pressure, particularly that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing the post of Chief Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had met the main requirement of the opposition and of the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf decreed on 3 November.
Shortly after his investment Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayum, and thus meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers in its ranks, had rejected all appeals last week against the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of Waziristan of the North in an attack on a military convoy, and four others injured.
According to the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded on a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
Germany's supergroups from the 1960s are glad to hear that the three members of the Harmonia Group have once again taken their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, records of their great success "Live 1974" appeared.
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced at the poster of the evening.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable, and first of all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, is a midway in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, is curved on his console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is added inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the Harmonia group again played has assured some emotions among Krautrock's lovers.
It has the right to be unveiled here: targeted surveys show that, of course, the name is reasoning in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case so long-lasting so that this group has been so painfully lacking for 32 years.
But why wouldn't the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the 1960s?
This is especially true of what is called "Krautrock" which has become more and more prominent in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo award in 2003 to the survivors of Cologne Can's group for their work, it was seen in the room the interviewing German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the pagan praise, the surprise was no longer limited.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother was sitting on the scene of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in itself and the transfiguration in the unknown is the only and unique.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period the impact power felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Rodeelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
First we played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a church-funded label, for financial reasons.
Rother had recently settled in Kraftwerk and finally became a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
About 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's musicians into exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Komune I" community, where Rodeelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-called there was in the trash a fan of the choral Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many retain Harmony far from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
Because as serene and moderate as music sounded, the group suffered material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not for itself.
The CD "Live 1974" that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griesm in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as well as someone believes to remember.
Rother gave up at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and made his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (burning hearts).
Cluster relives in the 1990s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the live album of Griesm to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its Grönland label has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Snow! had already been buried on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the World Cultures House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized under the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" pocket book.
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Eno's sentence is flat in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white pictures of wired tools in bazaar are used to form the legend.
In front of that, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by attaching microphones to the organ and battery, to shoot the instruments of the silent sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built itself.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
All three of them in major technical accessories.
At that very moment, the house choir will change nothing.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and suck under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He never acted rock.
The roots were less searched in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the leaking of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who screams "68" is not totally wrong, and also Harmonia is now no longer irritated by it.
But what goes most of itself will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does music start and where does it end?
This can tap on someone's nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Peace Murder", two films again address the Balkan war.
But both of them don't convince.
Either the projects are too much based on action and foolish shooting exchanges or on the contrary they are too teary.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: Of course the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkans mountains, but it is right there, in the darkest back country of the war in Bosnia, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the '90s, because too many nice and useless roles in women's sentiment movies and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have pleased him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why today's films should be as long and confusing as collective locomotive drivers conventions?)
It provides a magnificent representation full of eyelashes: deep down, his war reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and industry of the films were not as kind: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, has kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this appeal, "The Hunting Party" continues along with the German production "Material Peace", which also emerges this week, the endless suite of films missed on the Balkan War.
From "Major Peace" we can quickly make the trial: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar francs, in which one of the two falls soon in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs here are not presented as the only causes of all the evils, this film as flat as a telefilm is lost too quickly in the action and the exchange of senseless shootings.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why at the bottom there was never a good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioning themselves to track the high war criminal "the fox", may have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynical with a heart, as presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must attribute to it an extra romantic adventure with a Bosnian later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes' space, by an accelerated process, manages to ensure that NATO, the CIA and all the world's first-class hunters have failed in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of Crime against Cinematographic Logic should be brought before the Hague International Court.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at liberty, and he suspects the Americans and the French (where they must be exceptionally agreed) not to drive the hunt in a rather intensive way due to secret political agreements.
But the intentioned good and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem of Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I understand, I see the veins of the inflated forehead, clearly: as it is tiresome to be wicked."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but which insinuate how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films in Iraq were large flops.
We can add that there have never been good films in South Africa.
What is worth every time: when a star drags on a crisis home or on a field of mines, he then leaves something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All these conflicts may still be too close in time.
In any case, decades have passed before Hollywood could play a good film on the holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films still need to ripen - those who today hold classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no case been celebrated unanimously at their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know today as simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hectomb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it pleased the screenwriters the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" actually became as good as either because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe we shouldn't want to be good when we want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic artistic look and distanced from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because certain things never change."
"The great cities will always be horribly dangerous, the men will always be assassinated in a horrifying way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The take-off of the mayor with Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics met in politics and the economy with virulent criticism.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
The principal director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivation forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this goal, political-sport momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new longer-term starting point, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda".
Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions in Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to apply for Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation" said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports early December, about Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means that, in the time frame that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Sport Federation of Hamburg (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity by burying the projects now," HSB President Günter Ploß said Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would be further in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's candidacy at the University of 2015 as being "not a substitute" at the Olympics in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks appointed Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD fraction accused the Senate of not using this valuable time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Petit Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympics and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiads and subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have focused exclusively on the "Event factor".
The nomination for the Summer Olympics in 2012 would have raised a great enthusiasm for its part in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
It's not the Warhols caisses.
The one that connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden caisse, thinks of Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on the list of Warhol works.
A large part of the ninety-ten Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm has resulted in a disappointing result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the Pontus Hulten museum gave in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundred Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international art market.
The ancient history is covered, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" soapboards.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet was presented in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo mapping factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models of exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given proper permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not, in fact, exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden cases that at the time would have entered law in the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum wrongly claimed, later than about a hundred wooden cases had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then give it away.
Indeed, the 105 Hultén caisses were produced in Malmö in 1990 only for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other private Swedish collections, among which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and then put on, then applied with a paint brush to white oil.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals instead that the paint has been applied directly without a background layer on the stratified panels, using a paint roll - moreover it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These caisses have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six caisses in its collection as copies/materials of exhibition."
Already in July, Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "their charges" that will be raised in the case of soap crates in powder.
But since we've been out there inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers left, the same ones who had retreated to a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who criticized the President for corruption and election fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
The soldiers who were in power had recently assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were held in court on Wednesday due to an attempt by putsch missing in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the hearing to suddenly eclipse with about 30 supporters.
Military officers, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted themselves in his favor and joined in his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power closed the sector around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemns the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in command of the Ranger Scouts elite unit, said that other units of the army soon wanted to join the march.
The regime's criticisms had called for a great demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by the reproach of corruption.
The Manila Finance District has been the theatre of the mutineering attempt of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke up about 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts to putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versailles.
United Internet participated more than 20 percent of Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as the company reported on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the social capital would be held.
We've already speculated on a purchase before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versailles.
With this step we are trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet has been released.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third party, we tell on the market.
The night before, United Internet had already acquired close to 10 percent participation in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillisch placed in the stock market 17.4 million new shares worth € 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephones.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a spokesperson from United Internet.
The two companies founded the company in MSP participation to absorb the competitor Freenet.
At the moment, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation in Freenet, and not make use of their right to drown 18.49 percent extra at Freenet, United Internet Thursday.
However, the two companies would leave all options open, particularly to increase participation in the SA Freenet, we learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The yet unlikely poker on Freenet that has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German Telecoms market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million clients linked to a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL clients and full subscriptions.
The United Internet Holding and Drillisch had so far a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 per cent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring approximately four per cent more.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
