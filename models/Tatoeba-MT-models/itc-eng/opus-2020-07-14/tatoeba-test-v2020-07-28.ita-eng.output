I don't drink alcohol.
Looks like there's no way out.
We fell asleep.
I was very upset with him.
Why should we help you?
I put the plan into practice.
He made a list.
For a while I was really dependent on Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.
I think Tom's turning around.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
Did you tell Tom why you want to go to Boston?
Tom and Mary are gone now.
The more we are, the better.
She helped us.
She asked her teacher for advice.
He scared the devil.
What are these things?
I need it.
Is your dog a German shepherd?
We can fix anything.
He wants to buy a present for his boyfriend.
I went to the beach with Tom and his friends.
Good luck with the exam!
You don't even like fish.
Will you go with them?

I don't want to get close to them.
I'm sure tomorrow's gonna be good.
I don't usually close my eyes at night.
I want to stay home and read a book.
I want you to like Tom.
We don't want him to leave.
I'll be very busy next month.
Because of the weather, the plane's departure was two hours late.
Sami is reading that book.
Employees are all registered to a union.

My car is German.
I'm so happy Christmas is here.
I just have to get some rest.
She said she wasn't convinced.
I'm totally satisfied with my new home.
Why do you study English every day?
I would like to cross the United States of America with a decapitable one.
You won't find them there.
Your explanation is too abstract for me.
These monks live inside the monastery.
I just need to find him.
Can I see this?
He's able to speak in Japanese.
I could be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?
Tom will find a job soon enough.
Correct the highlighted words.
Did you tell him you were kidding?
Keep looking.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.
I wanted to go back to his village.
Tom is satisfied with his success.
You're reliable.
I didn't even consider it.
It's better to have friends in the square than money in the cash box.
You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree with 100%.
These flowers besides being beautiful also have a good perfume.
He's at the university now, right?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you learning with her?
Who breaks this window?
I'll tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd trade him for a Frenchman.
It's ten minutes later.
We waited for her yesterday.
Tom said Mary was low.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's very unlikely.
No doctor can explain.
I have to prove it.
You're depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?
It was all your imagination.
I'm not going to vote!
Why can't you do that?
Tom saved nothing for the pension.
Tom never screams at us.
Lalita called.
I thought you hated us.
I was in my bedroom.
They died.
You met someone.

He found out the secret.
Don't give her ideas.
What's your favorite video game?
Sami's hands are perfect.
Kyoto is an extraordinarily beautiful city.
I can't accept this gift.
It'll be our secret.
It'll happen soon.
I saw my sister there.
Why don't you try and fix it?
We've made a lot of mistakes.
I hope I see you tomorrow.
What does this have to do with my family?
Leave him at home if he wants!
I lived here for ten years.
I'd be happy to give you a ride.
He tried to get up early.
I like blue.
They have many different fish to try.
What is the difference between real diamonds and imitations?
Could you call me back later?
I would like two copies of each of these documents.
I expect I'll have to do it for Tom.
What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen more powerful than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We'll all die.
Tom continued to cry.
I can't do it yet.
George was out of the rage!
You're driving me away.
Are you willing to learn?
The poor are also people with feelings.
I'm sure Tom's just trying to help.
You smell so good.
I forgot everything about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm upset.
I know a good Italian restaurant.
We can't let him die.
As far as I know, Tom's on board.
What time does it leave here?
I usually drink a lot of milk.
With a smile, anything is possible.
I like black and strong coffee.
He says no one cares about something like that.
Tom works for a bank.
I had three options.
Tom and Mary will not be happy to see you here.
These goats are very friendly.
The two sisters are so alike that it is difficult to distinguish them.
Why don't the koalas have a umbilical?
Leave a message, please.
When was the last time you connected to the Internet?
I played with Tony yesterday.
We can't let this happen.
The thief entered through a broken window.
What do you call "I love you" in your language?
Start.
You look really pale.
Tom forgot the milk.
That song sounds familiar to me.
Do you have some plaster?
I'm bringing Tom some food.
I'd like to see a little dance.
I don't want to eat now.
Don't you want to eat?

You don't have to do this without permission.
I like his novel.
Who wrote the Bible?
I'll be ready.
We don't drink.
I came back from school, then I went out with my friends.
I got to the station this morning.
Does that make me look fat?
It's getting cheap.
He's not our son.
You're suffering from osteoporosis.
You can tell her that I said so.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
Look at that beautiful moon!
Tom's not much in greeting.
Now give me your hands.
I screamed.
Mary likes bananas, too.
I'm a housewife.
I want to meet them.
Tom's going to the mall.
Tom wants a large family.
Did you like it?
I should have stayed with her.
We'll be friends forever.
I've never stolen anything.
Tom tried to ignore Mary.
I got home late last night.
We finished gas in the middle of the desert.
Don't worry, I'll be home safe and sound.
Ask Tom if he will attend the meeting.
I can't run a company, it's too hard for me.
You're learning French?
Is that your son?
Tom never asked why.
He was often up late.
I don't often eat bananas.
Get them out of here.
I've never seen them wear hats.
Do you know Tom?
He had a book in his hand.
Give me a blacksmith, please.
Who found her?
What exactly did he say?
You need to go to the hospital.

I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
Tom did it for his family.
I prefer summer in the winter.

Show me another watch.
You want to stop her?
You should have seen them run.
He and I were in the same camp at the time.
Tom doesn't know how much he loves Mary.
I think I'm a target.
Tom hasn't heated his car yet.
I'll be happy to help you.
How long will it stay?
This is intolerable.
I appreciate you inviting me to the party.
I found the book very interesting.
You should buy a new car now.

What are you doing tomorrow?
I was talking to myself.
A ten thousand-dollar fine?
Take me away.
I really want to impress them.
What caused the incident?
Have you ever been to a foreign country?
I guess I drank too much.
I wrote to ask him why.
He doesn't have much time.
Skip the boring chapters.
He didn't even touch it.
It's pretty weird, isn't it?
You need to study more.
You're gonna be seventeen next year.
You learn quickly.
You have to save him.

He always complains about this and that.
I told Tom.
I'd rather get out than stay home.

Tom will probably be surprised.
I don't want her to get in trouble.
Why are you mad at me?
She's here to help, isn't she?
Let's get them out of the water.
I'm not sure, but I think I want to become a teacher.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Get your hands off her.

There are many problems to solve.
Is she home?
What's going on in Italy?

One of the reasons why Twitter is so popular in Japan is a very Japanese feature: Japanese uses the idegrammes that allow you to gather more information in 140 characters than other languages, without considering Chinese. Among other things, the Japanese version of this phrase is written with exactly 140 characters. How many characters do you want in other languages?
They ruined it.

Forget it.
He hates dogs.
Tom, where did he get this car?
The statue was damaged.
I wouldn't go with her for nothing to the world.
Can I get them?
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
It's a Hindu name.
You drink too much.
I just went to my uncle's.
I just need a hug.
Tom was too young to do that.
You guys are good.
We finally published the book.
I'd rather die than marry you!
I could never hurt Tom.
You think so?
It didn't happen much.
We should let him know.
I also put the ketchup in the fridge.
What are we gonna tell the others?
Who's the boss now?
They hid behind the tree.
Died some water to the dogs.

Turn right to the next intersection.
Did you forgive her?
We need water.
It's up to you.

Do I have to do it or not?
I'm invited to Claudia's party tonight.
I'm really happy for you.
I'll stop Tom.
We both love Tom.
He took my hand.

Have you ever visited Boston?
It's always going straight.
I'm the one who helped Tom.
It's extremely surprising.
Why do you always speak to me in English?
I don't think Tom's gonna be surprised.
I'd like a city plain.
Tom was singing.
You think you'd never imagine killing yourself?
Why are you reading it?
This must not happen again.
You don't have to know why I did it.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
Phirsichbaeumchen wants to learn beer.
Tom's not watching TV right now.
Respect is the basis of life.
This is no longer the case today.
What a tall guy he is!
When did you first meet Tom?
I hope Tom loses.
The car is not available today.

They talked all night.
Tom went to prison.
He's reading a novel.
There were a lot of people on the street.
You forgot to write them.

If he can't beat them, he'll join them.
Where did he put the key to the car?
She played.
Nobody knows.
I'll do what I have to do.
I never stopped loving Tom.
My father's been dead for three years.
I was about to surprise you.
It's too simple.
Why don't you work harder?
How's it going tonight?

You also ignore the most basic notions of science.
I suppose it makes sense to go ahead and pay the bill now.
Have you ever gone out with them?
Tom decided to slow down.
That would have been terrible.
We need to do our best to change things.
The boy was fixing a carp bench in the pond.

We often sing together.
There's a package for Tom on my desk.
Do you regret it?

He came with me.
I spend a lot of time in Australia.
She's crazy, isn't she?
She wasn't your sister.
I'm grateful to you for inviting me to the party.
This object is currently exhausted.
Tom is very clever.
He won't believe what happened today.
Can I take a picture of her?
I forgot your name.
We're calling our dog White.
Sami was drugging Layla.
It is not the length of life, but its depth.
It's so stupid, I swear I can't stand it.
We'll take it.

Tom doesn't want you to.
Tom's rich, but he's not happy.
Take the table out, please.
This is great stuff.
I did what I was asked to do.
I keep writing to Tom sometimes.
We just have to find him.
Can I see you again?
Let us solve this problem together.
Is this the first time you've done this?
Should I give this to Tom?
Do you have any friends?
I helped him.
You're really annoying.
The rest is history.

I just need a minute.
What color were they?
She's a weird guy.
We don't need to talk in the library.

I won't bother you anymore.
This box contains apples.
Can Tom do it for us?
If you have time, let's go shopping.
Are you home now?
I thought I'd go with her.
Hey, guys, I think I found something.
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
I can't trust you.

What course are you recommending?
The long journey worsened his misfortune.
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.
He did what he was told.
Tom gave Mary a banana.
Is it legal?

We should let her rest.
Nothing lasts forever.
I know you don't know her.
Please, bring us two cups of coffee.
I still have friends in Boston.
Were you jealous of them?
I'm sure Tom's not Canadian.
I want to be safe.
Tomorrow begins.
Can you speak in Esperanto?
I'll see her again next Friday.

Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe you should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Take a move, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.

We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe I should tell her.

Don't break my heart.
I don't have any plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We had fun.
She's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got upset.
I'm old already.
I have the dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English in a bookstore.
Tomorrow I go to the bookstore to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.

Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
Doesn't sound too surprised.

I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they're talking French.
Step forward.
You need to become more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?

This will make a big difference.

Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?

What's your favorite rapper woman?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's good to see you so happy.

I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's your picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a conference.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom soon presented himself for the lesson.
It's a little overweight, isn't it?
Who's the man playing the plan?
I've decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his drinks.
Search more hard on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's beginning to rain.
Do you play any tools?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom fought it.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.

You're good.
How would you like to change it?

Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot if you drink wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 thousand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please, tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the keys to the car.
I don't really want to talk.
So it must be Argentinian.
I really like my work.
I'd suggest you be more cautious.
She's shocked.
He was supposed to do it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.

Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.

She hired me.
I said I'd take it.

Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
How come you don't have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue quiet.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in advance.
We left this.

I don't like big cities.
That's what happened to me.
He doesn't have a few friends in America.

He's changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.

Complete the sentence.
The clock broke.

How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one currency.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture on.
You are my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where'd you eat?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June isn't that far, either.
Why does Tom hate it so much?
Do you know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He threw me out of the house.
My shoes were wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you leaving me?

Give him a hand, OK?
You wanted to ask me questions?
Don't play with Tom.
You'll land on your feet.

Tom stayed back.
This will be discussed tomorrow.

Tom's always in a good mood.
Can I get you some coffee?

You want me to be honest?
What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired, take him home, please.
May all your desires become true!
He already did.
He is expert with a word processor.
He was at the death gate.
You're hurt, aren't you?
His table is ready.
Is there going to be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, don't they?
Now let's talk.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit him in the head.
It'll be a lot of fun.

It is a disease to be obsessed with victory, a disease to be obsessed with the use of martial arts, and a disease to be obsessed with presenting everything that you have learned. It is a disease to be obsessed with attack, and it is also a disease to be obsessed with defense. It is also a disease to be obsessed with getting rid of the disease. To fix the mind obsessively on anything that is considered disease.
