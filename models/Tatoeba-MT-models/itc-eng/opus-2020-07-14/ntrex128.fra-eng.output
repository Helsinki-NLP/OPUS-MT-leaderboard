Members of the Assembly of the Wales concerned about "passing for puppets"
Welsh electors are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment of the Assembly's name, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of rallies.
A worker elected officer said that his group was concerned about the use of the label "rime with Twp and Pwp".
For readers not from Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Parti of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other forms.
The Conservative Party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing a change of name, stated that "the final decision concerning the name of the members of the Assembly is their final decision."
The Government of Wales (Government of Wales Act, 2017) Act 2007 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission is in favour of members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Wales prefer MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could be a real headset for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a draft law on name change in the weeks ahead.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the question of name in the discussions on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on the amendment of the country's name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be named "the Republic of Macedonia of the North".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a litigation of several decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has stressed that Macedonia's name constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, who was opposed to the referendum, said that he would not take account of the results.
However, partisans such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that changing names is only a small price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin reduced to silence
"The old people with whom I talked say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street," says Adams.
"There is no more of it today."
According to him, it's normal that the bars have rared.
Today, "we don't get to date in the same way, he explains.
"Before, we went to the bar as if we were at his neighbour's house, but that's not the case anymore."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before what the leaders imagine, and this concerns him: "earlierly, they will return to the home."
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who would not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
"People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely whites who will rush the closure of all churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members," he says.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The early white Methodist Congregation was abandoned in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was taken over by a black community under the direction of the Rev√©rend John Howard Johnson, who started a boycott of the shops of the 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which the Blacks were painting themselves for use or for promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and command a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor to the direction of the church of Saint Martin, Rev. David Johnson, proudly called "the bells of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave him a different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon in the church Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather states that Saint Martin has not replaced him.
In the last few months, there has been a lot of questions about the moving of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the parish council wanted to impose the costs incurred, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old teenager injured by a shark during a lobster fishing section
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old last Saturday while practicing lobster fishing in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 hours in the morning near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's TV channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy screaming with help and started paying up to him to get out of the water.
At first, Chad thought the boy was crying out of joy to have had a catch, and then he realized that he actually did
It was bitten.
As he approached the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I was shouting for everyone to come out of the water: There's a shark!" says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in a critical state.
The shark species that originated the attack is not known.
At a press conference, the rescue leader Larry Giles reported that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but that most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the UK aesthetics market
Sainsbury's hands low on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and rays similar to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field specialists.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetics market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow while fashion and home sales are falling, wider beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is conclusive.
Supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by television, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetic articles, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its boutique makeup line to offer a majority of non-tested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the fragrance seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops in Sainsbury's, the first open last week in Croydon, southern London, and a second one whose opening is scheduled during the course of the year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders must cross their heads to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to make their purchases online and to go to nearby stores for daily food.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sainsbury's, said that sales points will increasingly look like large areas, as the supermarket chain tries to counter shops discount Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to propel the sales of common consumer goods and to make the acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempts to restructure the rays of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics of the British chain had been overcome by failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's partnership with Boots was attempted, but it ended up following a controversy about the distribution of benefits from the pharmacies located in supermarkets.
It was after three years of selling his 281 pharmacies for 125 million pounds in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in the introduction of a wide range of high-end skin care brands in 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been modified to improve the customer environment.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beautification of our rays and the ideal situation of our institutions, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undisputed and changes the buying habits," added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal of an agreement of ¬£11 million
Coured by the star of the television program Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the entertainer Holly Willoughby from a contract of up to ¬£11 million linked to his home decoration brand, to dedicate to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the interior decoration brand and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptorow.
Age 37, this Morning's entertainer announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby was furious Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration at the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was furious when the beloved child of television revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the commercial empire of the Star of Dragon's Den in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, up to ¬£1.5 million, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their brand of interior decoration and accessories.
The Truly brand was likened to that of the actress Gwyneth Ptoutrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the estimated fortune of the entertainer to ¬£11 million.
When she was 37 years old, Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
and to ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is filled with products ready to be sold.‚Äù
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning's entertainer, which is one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause millions to lose to society, due to significant investments in goods ranging from cushions or candles, clothing or indoor items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
Moreover, this could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went together on vacation and Peter Jones held 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as an entertainer for the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was dull, but we finally loved it.
Trump has mocked the media that criticize him because of his comment that some people consider themselves "indignified by a president", and to show themselves so positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give in so much?"
He's on TV, taking a voice from a TV reporter.
"I have not given up at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-un supported the holding of a second meeting, after Trump qualified the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a point of death.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy leader Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that there was no "responsive response" from the United States to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
On the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his Trump assembly speech, it offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," North American president says.
We have engaged in armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile shooting tests, the release of hostages and the remnants of North American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this arena full of cracks, there's barely more than 200 standing in front of me," he said, pointing from the finger to the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGO assistance was not supposed to be necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had been scattered, but no state of national disaster had been decreed, a condition required for the launch of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they did not want international assistance, which makes things a little complicated," she regrets.
While the Save the Children organization sets up a team to go to Palu, she still doesn't know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, indicated that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian assistance.
Despite the ongoing shocks, the country has a cruel lack of means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refugees have been moved to Aceh, but there are few shelters in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been communicated, no alarm siren has held back from Palu, which has probably contributed to human losses.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from Indonesian island to Indonesian island is not simple.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been posted in Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the new disaster site.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has placed the reform of the infrastructure at the centre of his electoral campaign and has spent considerable sums to restore roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, undermined Mr. Joko's government, which was called to appear before the electors next year.
The Indonesian head of state also suffered pressure from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practiced their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, on the heart of clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool attacker Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a defeat at Liverpool in Premier League against Chelsea, marking at the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goals, and his team was running from 1 to 0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before moving towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ends up reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its way to the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to place myself, to grab the ball but players like Shaq always pull as far as possible, so I tried to make a maximum of time," Sturridge confides at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really much thinking I decided to shoot."
Chelsea took 1 to 0 in half-time after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
The Blues attacked a pass in the direction of Mateo Kovacic, before moving towards the middle of the ground and sprinter side Liverpool.
Kovacic realizes a quick go-and-come in the middle of the field,
then he drew a magnificent deep that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard crossed the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a left foot shot behind the doorman of Liverpool, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitains in the group phase of the League of Champions, on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo de Naples stadium, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in Europe UEFA League, at 3:00 this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: The number of tsunami victims rose to 832
The disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami balance sheet reported 832 deaths.
Many inhabitants are trapped under the debris of the buildings destroyed by the earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 that shook the country Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, informed the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was surrounded by debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
An investigation into murder was opened after a woman's dead body was found at Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 0755, the 44-year-old woman with a knife stroke was discovered on John Street of Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the residents of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statements: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone around John Street to Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard anything suspicious of contacting us.
In particular, I call on taxi drivers who could have picked up something on their dashcam and asked them to provide us with all crucial information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she was residing.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman presented themselves at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is under way, and the police have indicated that she was informing parents close to the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police don't authorize anyone to enter or exit the building.
The news left him without a voice.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer confirmed that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared in the places,
repeating: "It's too horrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were posted inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inner side of the cordon.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact the Czech Crime Agency at 0800, 555 111, as reported in register 247 of 30 September.
Parliament: Cromwell's statue, last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be just the return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural property in England, committed by its Puritian supporters, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and has called it a "revisionist attempt".
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, says that, "in view of the current debate about the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's one erected before the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor led the iconoclasm during the English civil wars.
It is likely that a person was sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said on Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, I mean of the monarchy of course.
The fact that this representation is precise or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
Its achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated."
China: a pig kills a breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a South-East China market.
Identifyed as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered with blood near a dirt market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig shop on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday, in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door of the neighboring bitch was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was in there and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A medical legal report confirms that the animal weighs 250 kg has mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the raiser's cousin, said that "his legs were rubbed and covered with blood."
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death was neither the breeder nor his cousin.
A market manager entrusted Eventing News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incident and to allow the police to collect evidence.
The family of the breeder Mr. Yuan and the market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks against individuals have already been reported.
In 2016 in a farm in Massachusetts, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously hurting the latter.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg places a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get away from him.
In 2012, while a Oregon breeder had just been devoured by its pigs, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can lead to this type of behaviour.
"They are rather playing animals,
very curious kids... they have no intention of doing harm.
Just show them the respect they owe," he assures.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa should cause severe precipitation in the South-East of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa faints as it moves over the coldest waters on the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause aversion in north-eastern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
The winds were at 135 km/h (oragan of category 1) since 5 h in the morning, time of the East Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane should travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows east to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches on Monday from the low-California peninsula in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the north, in the south-west of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico this Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the south-west over the next few days.
At the local level, precipitations reaching between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden crusts, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Adverse reactions will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwest regions, including a large part of Arizona.
Disseminated tropical rains may cause high flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Intense rains could convert canyons into drained rivers and storms will produce gusts of wind and dust peats by places.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern regions of the country, on the coast of California.
The total rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could lead to low debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical aversions will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, and will intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall across the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Major variations in temperature are to be expected for the month of October through the United States due to the refreshing of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
This is a perfect example of the central region of the United States, which will be subject to considerable temperature differences on Sundays.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat forces to infiltrate and intensify again.
A major part of the center and east of the United States should be known for a beginning of months of hot October, with temperatures of around 26 degrees covering the plains of the south and other regions of the north-east.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
The multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures should be higher than the average in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 television channels Thursday, the seizures of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting him in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse persists, the broadcasting services have interrupted their regular Friday program to announce a scene: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Senate of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate's Judicial Commission, Christine Ford made sure 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had turned on her person and had tried to take off her clothes during a high school evening.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate trance, also claimed to be 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial has probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Moreover, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators widely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most watched channel during the day of the auditions, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with a hearing reaching 3.26 million.
They followed CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.99 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
The interest did not weaken once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama playing Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a communiqu√© that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was taken apart by demonstrators as he tried to take the elevator to the court hearing.
Flake lowered her eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of the live interview.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," he throws one of the women.
"Do you really believe he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are poor.‚Äù
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake indicated that her office had issued a statement and would say more at the committee meeting.
All the wired and broadcasted network channels covered the meeting on-line a few hours later, while the judicial committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh by the entire Senate.
However, Flake indicated that a one-week survey should be conducted by the FBI on the charges against the candidate, which the minority Democrats claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by discussing with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance sheet, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault charges.
Great Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making "small politics"
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project of leaving the European Union, of making "small politics" to the detriment of the future of Britain and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "very ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police stop Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being the cause of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a fatal shot suspect who led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was beaten up and accused of murder at the second level, reported the Baton Rouge police service.
The authorities posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Founded at the crime scene, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
In his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the lawyer of the parish of Baton-Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by an injury by a bullet that crossed the head and settled in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the medical-legal laboratory of the State Police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement forces for their "commitment and quest for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Red, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, it marked 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per match during the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach said the team was "devasted and under shock" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We write this kind of event all the time," says Wade.
Mexico: a volcano cracks ash
From the ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Reduction Centre recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after having recorded a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring several shocks and tremors from Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed fine layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity at the volcano level at 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists approaching the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and the riot police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being refouled by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and coloured powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not dissipate tourists.
Helmets also exploded later in the day, while the police used matriculas to contain the clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence that scanned "neither forget nor forgive", faced unionist partisans shouting "long life in Spain".
14 protesters with mild injuries were treated according to the local press.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, judged illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain alive in the independent region.
A overwhelming majority of voters have chosen independence, despite a low level of participation, the opponents of secession who have largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing the regional polling stations.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It was in the same place, but it was forced to take a different itinerary.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said that he no longer had any hope of independence from Catalonia.
"We were witnesses last year of a great time.
My parents would cry for joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a impasse," he laments.
Despite their capital victory, although minor, in the regional elections last December, independenceist Catalan parties had difficulty maintaining the momentum this year, many people's leaders were exiled or detained pending trial for holding the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who filmed the police support demonstration on his phone, found that politicians were responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand and on the other.
"The tension only makes it rise," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a trial since last year, announced his intention to apply for election to the European Parliament next year.
"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government," he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men percussion a house by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after having buried several times on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrowshots.
Livingston wins match 1 to 0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
The first goal of Dolly Menga is to win Livingston
Recently raised in grade, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place itself in the second position of the ranking, equal to Hibernian.
Gerard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premiership league this season, and have to face the Hearts team on Sunday, which leads 8 points.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Rapid Vienna on the occasion of the Europa League this Thursday.
With regard to the Livingston team, she has extended 6 games in the division, and her main coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can strive to have not yet lost the least meeting.
Livingston missed an opportunity to face angry opponents
Holt's team could have come forward long before it started, as their direct approach put the Rangers in difficulty.
Scott Robinson tried to do it but remained stuck in front of the opposing goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
Livingston's team left the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that they could be embarrassed by the tactics worked.
That's where the ultimate goal is.
The Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston tried to open it; Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to match Menga, who took a touch and entered a goal of the middle of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves faced with an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only rarely worried.
The second half of the time was the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos had forced a stop on Kelly.
The Ranger Guardian Allan McGregor stopped a hit by Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to play one of the Livingston's plans.
Livingston's guardian rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a lack of hands.
Livingston‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpecific‚Äù - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont de la BBC Scotland, to Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the merit is largely to Holt for having since its arrival motivated a team
which has many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grand and magnificently organized, and Menga managed to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in haleine for the duration of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level reached with Gerard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed one last opportunity and were unable to pierce the opposing side only once; this is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the picture.
Home mixed with President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Several issues, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU, have been addressed.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators, mostly Kurdish, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in his country.
The cleavage that emerges from protests reflects Erdogan's double vision: a visitor welcomed by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies following a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at around 10.15 local hours, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The vehicle driver stopped, the rescue arrived on site, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London police said the officers were doing everything they could to identify the individual and to prevent his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been put in place. Car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 agents injured in a riot
The senior security officer said that six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot started in the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, around 0930 hours this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized riot agents were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On site, the officers were treated for slight facial injuries.
A spokesperson from the prison management said: "The staff trained has been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will have to answer the police authorities and be able to see their sentences extended."
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals who are considered the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison manager was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot agents were sent to prison to root out a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the personnel with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by high creases (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to touch Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading towards the southwest desert with what remains of its energy. This region could be affected by sudden crusades.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with announcing rains as early as Monday night.
The Phoenix-based national weather service stated in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950 !
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center provide 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the southwest desert including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Grand Basin should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of sudden crusade.
Although the flood risk should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, just over 40% of Arizona had at least one extreme drought, the second most serious category," saidweather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins his journey on the coast, in the peninsula of Basse-Californie.
Always with great power Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at 20 km/h speed.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the strength of a hurricane on Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and could lead to flood risk.
"In total, between 7.5 cm and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the border of Arizona Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
"Global rains are expected in Basse-Californie, north-west of Sonora and in the southwest desert and are the main danger," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially fatal high peaks and debris flows in the arid areas, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested indicted for attempted homicide, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday about 4am in the morning at local time.
He's been sent to the hospital, his condition is currently stable.
The police of Avon and Sommerset reported having arrested the four young people (age 17, 18 and 20) on the night of the Radstock side.
The officers called on people who might have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been a victim of the wickedness and anger of Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the wickedness and anger of Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of Congress on Thursday, rejecting with energy and emotion Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, which accused him of sexually assaulting him several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" today.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of the Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first decisive vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to the statement by a member of the Republican Party to CNN.
Indonesia: an earthquake and a tsunami of hundreds of victims, the balance sheet continues to adjourn
On Saturday, the authorities said that at least 384 people had been killed, most of them being carried away by huge waves that had been shot down on the beaches while a earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of C√©l√©bes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six meters high immersed the beach at the fall of the night. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People didn't immediately run away, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Catastrophe Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone. He drove cars, pieces of wood, houses, he took everything with him," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing to the trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air images published by the Disaster Management Agency show destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes have been felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (PPPT) said that the energy released by the Friday Earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Corps were found trapped under debris debris, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that human and material losses could be more significant over 300 km from the north coast of Palu, a region called Dogalgaa, the closest to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications were "completely paralyzed" from Dogalgaa, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," La Croix Rouge said in a communiqu√©, adding that his staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disseminating the information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived as time for the alert to be published.
A shared amateur video on social media shows a man on the floor of a building that is frenzied to the passersby on the street that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall lay on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate images immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a general power failure that cut all communications to Palu, so it was difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to drive aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city has reopened as part of the relief operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centres of Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: The tsunami victim's balance sheet is rising, with more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The members of the World Vision staff of Dogalgaa arrived safely and safely in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters located in the courtyard of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to the disaster victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not yet the case.
"This disaster is always considered regional," says Aulia Arrani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that it is a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing people still hoped for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sundays, the rescuers have released a woman enveloping under the debris for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, Gendon Subandano, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, and M. Mandigi added.
"As an elder in paragliding discipline, I have experienced my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon reported that he had desperately sent messages WhatsApp to athletes in Palu who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
"I believe they have never received my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtract $26,750 from the charging of an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging an automatic distributor to Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport police service.
The vehicle driver lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communiqu√©.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a money bag for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leave the premises, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
The Kanye West rapper is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Anciently known as Kanye West."
41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to the program Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his coming for "emotional reasons," explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current pseudo professional, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you," explained West earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
"Then I am you, I am us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye - reflecting good, evil, confusion, all.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the trait of union and capital.
In Mexico, AMLO states that it will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, almost 50 years after bloody reprisals of law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday Tlatelolco's place to "never use military force to punish the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people at the time the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of opportunities for education are driving young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several actors in the U.S. government made announcements about the I.A., while an official I.A. strategy is missing in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the leader of AI innovation by 2030.
"Dubling funds for research in the field of IA would be a good start, as all other countries have an advance on the United States, and we are looking for the next major discovery in IA," says Lee.
Double the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the IIA comes from the United States, Lee said to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most important IT companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that beat the best-class American Othello player. He then integrated Microsoft Research's management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to obtain funding from the government.
"It's not China that owns academic leaders, it's companies," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large academic names to work on the IA.
Lee added that the changes in immigration policies could also support the efforts of the United States in the field of IIA.
"I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers," he says.
The Council of State Affairs of China unveiled its new generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is weaker," Lee explained.
Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academic partners. The White House has announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million per year in research in the IIA.
At the same time, the US legislation that works to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, the inhabitants of Macedonia made their voices heard at a referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia. This change would resolve an old dispute of several decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of which is called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name represents a right on its territory and has opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents said that the change would affect the ethical identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia, a majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote at the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% participation required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to the name-changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which has been rescued from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that she can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, which means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgijska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote was not legally binding, sufficient members of the parliament claimed that they would follow the result of the vote and make it decisive.
The change of name would require a majority of two-thirds of parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 13 h.
But the participation was only 16%, while it reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that had mobilized 66% of the votes cast.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the voice for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to go through the big door," said Kavarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from necessary investments, and the unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr. Zaev after filing his newsletter.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57 per cent.
70% of those with the intention of voting said that they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, 50 per cent of the votes plus one vote are required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-west government policy since it took power last May.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, leads a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 game on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The goal of Aguero, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine butter received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three defenders of Brighton, before diving on the ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He turned around a defender before evicting the others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the balloon to Sterling on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to send the balloon back to Aguero, who used his right foot to mislead Brighton's guardian, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," Pep Guardiola, the team coach, explained to journalists.
"We said he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he marked at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave Skyblues the initial advantage during the First League game,
From 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on Brighton's ground.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few clicks before he led Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the balloon into the nets just before they slipped out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play Fever Disorders Against Rockies
Since the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start in a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play on Sunday against the Rockies of Colorado, but only in case of an elimination match for the Rockies, real legends in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies took him to the Nationals on Friday evening, but they are still trying to secure their first division title.
"Even if this game doesn't have any issues, we want to throw the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level that I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce a launch for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be training Thursday and will launch during his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The law enforcement officer in Washington is 18-7 with an average of 2,53 and 300 withdrawals on catches in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation that generated his support for the Supreme Court in Brett Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of the Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a major issue. I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever. That is why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this terrible radical group, really horrible, from Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They care about whom they hurt, whom they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it on the last four days," he added, before calling the Democrats "in anger, in contempt and insanity."
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the U.S. Senate and Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which was entitled to be heard by the public.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Have you released the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community he was.
It is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When activists from the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour Party parliamentarians who are considered not to be welcome.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she rose against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour on Friday said: "We want the gathering to be inclusive and productive."
That's exactly what the Friday evening general assemblies were for my eight years as a Labour Party parliamentary.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today for many gatherings and the promise of more gentle and respectful policies has long been forgotten if it has never been taken into account.
It became evident that the opposing opinions were no longer tolerated in the party. Each opinion was judged to be acceptable by the party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy's power was taken. The colleagues with whom I was thinking of sharing a same political vision began to wait for me to return my jacket and take positions against my beliefs, whether it is about national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I was being abused on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I had received were of a political nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a disparity of sexists or racists every day, but who don't give up their arms.
One of the most disappointing things about the current policy is the normalization of various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is confined to the motions of defiance and changes in the rules of selection.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years: to lower my eyes, not to express my ideas so strongly, and it would be all right.
But it's not to act like I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolgirl, because the neglect of the Thatcher government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I had the desire to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as local advisor or minister of government.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with current party officials.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion Friday is that the country is going to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think it is not really time to waste time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the leader of the party.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my electors, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunity will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your interests to all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr remains invincuous
Two late trials may have failed the final result, but no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph after the intense game day of the Scottish Championship from rugby to XV.
The team is now at the top of the ranking and is the only team invincible of the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate this match.
"Until now, we have been tested, but we remain invaincus, so I must love myself happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose congratulated Ayr: "Good to them, they were more effective than we and were able to seize the opportunities."
Grant Anderson's test, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in good position, but a yellow board for Scottish Wing Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers. Jason Baggot took on an unprocessed test.
Climo worsened the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of the day. It marked and transformed a solo test to climb the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose began the second half-time and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
It followed a long wait due to a severe wound of Ruaridh Knott, who left the ground on a street. At the recovery, Ayr resumed the fronts with a Stafford McDowall trial transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow cardboard and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an unprocessed test by Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team came back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having tagged Climo when he did not have the ball, since the touch of the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's apple, which was progressing.
Climo turned the test, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry's wing away for the fifth home team test.
Still Game star launches in restoration
Ford Kieran, the Star of Still Game, decided to do a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-animizes with his long-standing partner on stage, Greg Hemhill.
The duo announced that the ninth series that arrived will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "exploring environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a armoured boat in the La Paz Naval Headquarters.
Public buildings build a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazonia, the naval bases show the following motorcycle: "The sea returns to us in law.
The recovery is a duty."
Throughout the entire Bolivia blocked, the memory of a lost coast to the benefit of Chile during a conflict of bloody resource in the 19th century is still well present. Just like the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so visible for decades. Bolivia is actually awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be made on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive result," explains Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will take action in favour of Bolivia's application. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial struggle for the election next year), also has much to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will decide in favor of Chile, and that little will change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations proceeding based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant a Chilean territory, and stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the latest arguments shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Z√°rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have hurt her.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," said Z√°rate.
Morales' war rhetoric has spared all the good Chilean will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very complicated to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Veltz√©, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring to Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - which remains to date one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political shell.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must abandon the past."
North Korea affirms that nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said that his country would not give up its nuclear weapons until it had trusted Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to respect the promises made at a Singapore summit among the leaders of both rival countries.
He spoke at the time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Jong One, current North Korea leader.
Ri states that it is "chemical" to think that the continued sanctions and opposition of the United States to a declaration that will end the Korean war will collapse the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of meaningful pre-emptive disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's seriousness of giving up an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in order to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades reveal the latest curfew trends, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL pieces to your collection of hats or protect you from the sun to 100%, no longer look.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delusional oversized hats during a PE19 parade that honored the Paris Fashion Week style.
All the more extravagant hats the others invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their dazzling pieces into the parades.
Valentino's lightpiece was a beige eccentric hat adorned with a broad edge that evoked a feather, which covered the head of the mannequins.
The other oversized accessories included jewelry-plated pastries, a sorceress hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had sewn lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than the High Couture.
One creation looked like a diving equipment, with tubing and glasses, while another was thinking of a molten ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to style observers, imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the silage of the "Bomb", the straw hat on board that the stars pull, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that commercializes this hard portable hat that flooded social networks has presented another of its light creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the swimsuit mannequin that wore it.
The burnt orange flea bag, decorated with fringes and a white leather handle, was the masterpiece of the PE19 parade The Jacquemus Riviera during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrities stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in the shops for next summer. The creator has so marked the spirits that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills are critical to the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools maintain a school record of excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results enhanced by a collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) seek to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and setting up a school-based programme, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.‚Äù
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and build a confidence link with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are high in the ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest score, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that schools independent of Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 shows that among the difficulties faced by employers in recruiting candidates, 17% are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are thus increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of his career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real benefit in the future through this sustainable competence.
The ability to communicate directly with strangers will automatically place the multilingual person in front of his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not master a foreign language enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have better chances of finding rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are important to the United Kingdom in the future of 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with a specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary for their success, regardless of what the future holds.
It is clear that, at present, in a global trading environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look at LeBron James' beginnings at Lakers in Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, Laker Coach, announced that James would play in pre-season, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we still don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After the training, early in the week, James' projects for the pre-season program, which includes six games, were requested.
"At this stage in my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Trump Campaign in West Virginia ( YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump began a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other steps, especially in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
As the vote to confirm the vacancy in the Supreme Court was postponed, Trump sought support for the upcoming mid-term elections and prevented Republicans from losing control of Congress in November.
What time is the Trump meeting held in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, Virginia-Western, is scheduled for 19.00 (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the candidate's hearings at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until one week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings aims primarily to help Republicans win the ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American President stated in his campaign that the five meetings aimed to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congressional control is such an essential element of its program that the President will go to as many states as possible in this early election campaign," Reuters told a spokesman of the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, this evening's meeting, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of Pittsburgh's media."
On Saturday, it will be the second visit in a month of Trump in West Virginia, a State he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is in the middle of the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to revive him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political science specialist at West Virginia University, Reuters said.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope in the approach of the simple Sunday
After three simple, Saturday afternoon foursomes could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The swing swing movement is a sport concept invented of all parts but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in such tournaments as this.
Where, then, would they find the propeller now?
"They took six points in advance and now four, so it gives us a little wings," said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Europe has the benefit of course with four points ahead and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have a feeling of having a little doll wind and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can strive to have each three points out of four.
Spieth has been terribly effective from tea to green and has been an example.
The screams of energetic joy intensified as his game advanced. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize the fourth part while Thomas and he was led two down after two holes.
His whore, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, sparked a similar scream, from those who tell you that he believes the American team still in high school.
"You really have to stay determined and focus on your game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the story of Ryder Cup shows.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four matches and has no right to error.
Not only were "Moliwood" the only ones not to realize a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way in which their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd in hijacking them, refers to them as the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to be able to rekindle a potential European victory while the sun falls on the National Gulf.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, a gold hero of the morning, while he was teaming up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole they could never show up.
On the other hand, no one's here on Sunday to help you.
Fourballs and ants are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between pairs, advice they give and those they don't give, and how a strategy can move in a blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made considerable progress over the last day, but this foursome session has also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe takes 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after it won 10-6 on the United States during the fours and fours of Saturday.
The duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari carried the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods in distress, which enabled them to score four points until now.
Determined to retain the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning rounds, facing a disordained American team.
The United States has demonstrated greater resistance in the ants and won two victories, but they have failed to resort the gap.
Jim Furyk's men have to pick up eight points on 12 Sundays when they are simple to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to pick up four points, while Molinari and him, named "Molliwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history to get four points during their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the ovens, they beat the pair made up of the American beginner Bryson Dechanbeau and a Woods already tired by a 5 and a 4 even more categorical.
Woods, who slashed during the two games on Saturday, shone a few times, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the forts of the morning, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the forsoms, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, in a cool but clear time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the reference for the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the forballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the forsome, these lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, had nothing but to do zero match to keep its trophy.
After having been seconded for two days, however, they may not return from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea states that disarmament will not be "in any case" unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions strengthened its confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for its country to give up unilaterally to its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
At the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as ending nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing site and its commitment not to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to disarm unilaterally."
While reiterating North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps, its statement was important that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore at the first summit between an American President in exercise and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to working for a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused requests for afforestation of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and increases pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even opposing the "declaration of the end of war".
‚ÄúThose who think that these sanctions can make us rain don‚Äôt know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ri made no comment about the second summit between Kim and Trump in front of the United Nations by the U.S. leader earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the part concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a dead end."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he had stated before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles on North American territory after President Trump had qualified Kim as a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, did not praise the courage with which Kim applied disarmament measures, but added that there was still much to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that no time limit had been set. "It may take two years, three years or five months; it does not matter," he said.
China and Russia maintain that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "The application of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until the total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to undermine the financing of Pyongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month in order to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made, but in the following hours, North Korea denounced its "gangster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has undertaken to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "equal measures".
According to South Korean President Kim is demanding the security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to standardize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Rest Courses
This year, the University of Harvard has set up a new course that allows all first-cycle students to sleep more and fight against the growing Machist trend that consists in studying caffeine consumption all night long.
A professor noted that most students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of the kind in the United States.
It is after giving a conference on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea has come to him
At the end, a student approached me and said, "Why do I know that only in the last year?"
She stated that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of Health Services at the University, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee fees, curtains, basketball, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical benefits and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know this information - in the same way you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of "getting a white night" still exists, and it adds that modern technology and the growing pressure exerted on students is a growing problem of sleeplessness.
Having enough sleep and good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid taking weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in in anion mode, making them starved permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian chemistry and physics student, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and moved him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to propose to all third-cycle students to follow a similar program of studies before reaching the deemed institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students predict an alarm both for bedtime and waketime, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleeping disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to bring down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered a new blow outside, the attack by Dolly Menga leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team to Livingston to a defeat of 1-0.
The Ibrox team hoped to record its first victory on the move from its 4-1 triumph in February to St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted his second defeat on Gerard in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team at the drift, eight points behind Hearts, leading the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston stands in third position, right behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerard made eight changes in the team, which swept Ayr in half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, chose the same Livi 11 that pulled a point at Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see that his well-trained team blew up his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the balloon, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored in two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle of the field let his chance pass.
Keaghan Jacobs then took a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have received a penalty after the strike when Steven Lawless and he got caught up, but Arbitrator Steven Thomson dismissed Colombian demands.
The Rangers took advantage of only two shots in the first period, but the former guardian of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria hit.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute was recorded against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' arrest.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the balloon to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard reacted in mid-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the wing appeared before Morelos, but impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston has also continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long bullets on long bullets.
Holt's team could have taken the advantage in the last few moments, but McGregor has worked well to repel Jacobs before Lithgow passes next to the goal.
The Ranger replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty at the end of the game while he was caught with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger meter
And now, a page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and THE COMPTEUR TOURNE... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger meter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two improbable scientists:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, it's used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, the effects of atoms released into minerals can actually be heard by radioactivity."
Evans: "Say, it's sure it jumps there!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention bearing his name remains.
A new vaccine against cancer allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new vaccine against cancer allows the immune system to "detect" and kill cancer cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting and modifying immune cells from a patient in a laboratory
They can then "decelerate" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to learn the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting and modifying immune cells from a patient in the laboratory so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally re-injecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein "protein causes an increase in several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to "learn" to target cancer cells, has been demonstrated in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Coiff√© of a MAGA helmet, Kanye West began in a Pro-Trump diatribe after passing to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was horrified on the stage after a derailed performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to run in the elections in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang by wearing a Make America Great Again, West took the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times, I speak to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism had bothered me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL program started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been broadcasted, the record of West's diatrics has been relayed on social media by Comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the backseats because of his helmet.
‚Äú They pressured me.
They told me not to come with this cap on my head.
They pushed me!
And then they say I'm in a dump," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the gouffer?" and claimed that he would wear his superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted him from the public at least twice, and the SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. One person on the spot told the magazine: "A death silence has fallen on the whole plateau."
West had been called to replace last minute singer Ariana Grande, including the former little friend, the Mac Miller rapper, who died a few days earlier.
West dissociated many by singing song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "In one of the bravest minds: MERCI DE'AVOIR TENU T√âTES AT THE FOULE."
But Karen Hunter, the entertainer of the show, tweeted that West was simply "loyal to himself, and that it is absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or supporting his art) who, in my view, adopts and pours out a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogg rapper named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fire, which changed his name as a symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Indictment of attempted murder after assault on the white weapon in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused should appear before the Court of First Instance in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes care of the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a final blade, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent fantasy medieval series.
But the 31-year-old actor took the stereotype of male hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to go for tough leather to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that "something is not going" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, covedette of Game of Thrones, also aged 31, confessed that he had "firmly" to address this question.
"Personally, I think deeply that we have harmed masculinity."
"What lessons have we learned from young men who become adults, in relation to the problem now posed?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What behaviour is innate, what behaviour has been inculcated?
What does television and the street teach young boys who encourage them to think that they must behave in this way to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change that?
There's obviously something going on."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do prologues or suites when the series ends next summer, claiming that he had finished with "the battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will be the star of a recovery of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now," he says.
Rose interrupted Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in the Leslie family domain.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are involved.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients have been infected in sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was practically reduced to zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference held in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remained widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese Government has promised, since 2003, universal access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters disagrees that a PG employee has disclosed information about senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "complement theories".
On Saturday, American Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and websites "extreme right".
"False lies, lies, and still infamous lies" reacted Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It would appear that the disclosed information included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown in Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information."
"This false claim is completely false and a true lie."
Waters' statement quickly gave rise to online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press officer.
"This denial is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that it does not have the necessary temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something she has not done, she must not be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not challenge the accuser's motives.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also spoke of his reflections on Twitter.
"If that's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters reported that his office had warned "the authorities and services responsible for the enforcement of the laws concerned" about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, spy under duo
It has now become a tradition of looking for Brexit's scope in any new British film, and this seems to apply to this resumption of Johnny English's action comedy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and remade the surface in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satire on the issue of the evidence of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes etched and face in rubber, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comical creation designed for a non-English film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts of glamorous charm, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the type that performs a small note in Les Chariots of fire during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
Originally, he is also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery who Atkinson once played in the TV commercials Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English getting close to a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licences like 007 and impossible Mission make up themselves in full confidence with comedy.
Humour seems to be more oriented towards children than toward adults and, to me, Johnny English's mesaventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent movie gags in Bean's character.
The constant premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer pirate infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great disarray of agents in service - a weakly large role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vessel overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the brink of the crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character quasi-Teresa-May, but there is little to put himself under the stage.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means you have to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school teacher, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some beautiful jokes here, because English proposes a spying academy like Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-term partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who create great trouble for Her Majesty's secret services, look to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the influence of the technology billionaire charismatic, who is said to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of jokes: under the disguise of servers, they set the fire to a bright French restaurant; they create a chaos by faking on the luxurious veil of Volta; and English triggers a true anarchy when he tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops are secured for this last sequence, but despite all, there's not bad things for children in all this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't help but think, as for Johnny English's other films: Can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to have developed a plan for the British to be able to work four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party needs to examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to pay the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would agree with the party's economic programme and plans to guide the country for workers.
The passage to a week of four days was approved by the union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party stated to the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not happen in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalance the economy for workers and with its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by it."
Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's working conference to give details about his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power in the hands of "anonymous directors" and "profiters" in public utilities.
The plans of the alternate chancellor also provide that current water company shareholders may not be able to recover the full amount of their disposal, since the Labour Government could operate "deductions" due to alleged deviations of conduct.
It has also confirmed its plan of integration of workers into business boards and the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private enterprises to employees, which will involve up to ¬£500 of dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy entrust to "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was postponed from at least one week after the FBI's investigation of the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a widespread interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent of the "60 Minutes" program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
‚Äú Of course, ‚Äù says Kennedy.
"By going to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
It was resolved, determined, unequivocally."
However, Graham's vote seems to be engraved on the stone.
"I made my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be required," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically," Graham added, alluding to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she calls have not been able to check it out.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I see nothing new that changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star cover and an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now at its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people coming to Central Park's Great Lawn in order not only to benefit from the provision of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the festival, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project extension, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively combat it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), viewers were required to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, telephoneing or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of the population in the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really allow them to persuade them to call for action, or is it just another example of "clickivism" - a situation in which people really think to make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, including at least $10 billion of which has already been disbursed or lifted.
The group believes that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed themselves to "help children develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda assistance of 35 million pounds Sterling to end malnutrition in that country after receiving over 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and the Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the group Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the The Power of Nutrition program at a concert that took place in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following the company's over 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in the context of nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, as the great civil rights movements and the struggle against apartheid before us, we will do so, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon√°e are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will enjoy the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a "block" to block Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the American Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, the US secretary to the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that enables it to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, obstruct their energy from being placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "power consumer spokesperson" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in reality identical.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia by saying that it has "more than one string in its arc" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements arrive at a time when the Trump administration has committed itself to boosting the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the "inappropriate" project of the Northern Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that North Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in Moscow in September following a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Energy Secretary, the Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said "I think we share this view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has provoked negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to become involved in European energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider presenting herself to the 2020 presidential elections, says the Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be thinking of presenting herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top," she says, The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider submitting my candidacy to the Presidentials."
Warren said what she thought about President Donald Trump at the public gathering, claiming that he "led this country in the wrong direction."
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and of his candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a message on Twitter, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters are not of the opinion that it is expected to take place in 2020.
According to the survey of the Political Research Centre at the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said that the Senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other names of very well-known Democrats for a potential campaign in 2020 include those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin evokes Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son currently experiences, what he feels when he goes home, I can link it to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers return," she told the public at the Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, in Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a taboo subject and said about his son and other ex-combatants that "they come back a little different, hardy, wondering whether they would respect what their comrades and members of the air forces and each other, gave to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic assault and violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness.
18 States and the Columbia District are in favour of a legal challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the Columbia District are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and the district filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum-seekers who challenged this policy, NBC News said.
The complainant's full name in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs", had attacked her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Appeal of Immigrants, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law states that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such prohibition violates this principle," said friend Curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the memory that the policy of refusal of entry of immigrants is detrimental to the American economy, supporting that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing marital violence and gang violence in June.
"Assile is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political convictions," said Sessions on 11 June in its announcement of the said policy.
"The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people encounter every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her boyfriend in Palu, in an evacuation center of the vide city.
"At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen to go to their destroyed homes, to pick up scraped goods, and to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of the military hospital in Palu, where the patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," said Haris to Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" by means of "propaganda advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper had been advertising four pages boasting the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China in an American daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the supplement paid by China Daily in Les Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa ‚Äì after accusing China of attempting to join the US parliamentary elections on 6 November, an accusation that China rejects.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to join the US elections, Trump marked what the American leaders said to Reuters to be a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures aimed at hitting state exporters like Iowa supporting Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, United States ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion article published in the Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paid advertising into the Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"On the other hand, at Beijing's press outlet, you will find few opposing voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the disturbing Chinese economic trajectory, as the media firmly obey the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying what newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republicans draw the electors near the mid-manda elections due to the Kavanaugh debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the next mid-term election.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, said "we cannot go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) in favour of an FBI investigation were sufficient to calm the anger of the voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said on September 28 according to the Washington newspaper.
Friday morning, Mic report, the protesters sang "The month of November arrives!" in the corridor of the Senate while the Republicans governing the Judiciary chose to advance Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be broken," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in suburban electricians and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the nominee of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that the reaction would be likely to be alive if the Republicans moved the confirmation forward.
According to NBC News, the former president of the National Republican Committee, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week that "it became a mess for the GOP."
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh, but also the way in which the Republicans managed the situation and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps the elected Democrats in the television newspaper.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans appear to be divided about the credibility of the two parties, a small majority weighing on the latter's side.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41 per cent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony, or probably, while 35 per cent said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent said they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after the pressure of Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate's Judicial Committee that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while in a state of drunkenness at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the candidate for the Supreme Court would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a new company that seeks to rival with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's Solid-Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as people who are allowed access to such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated by joking that Inrupt was intended to "lord the world."
"We must do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "online personal data store" or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a musical library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The particularity of the personal data store online is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
As of this week, technological developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that his team and he are not yet in discussion with " Facebook and Google" to know whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely chambued in an instant.
"We do not ask for permission."
In an article published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that "the [Inrupt] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he launched Inrut, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a Ecclesiastic of the First World War decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only churchman of the Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and did not know that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, affirmed that he was "glamously symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after the operation of his grandfather.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under the violent shooting of campaign cannons and machine guns".
Later, he rushed on the firing line and, with the "best bravery", he drove the line before jumping a campaign canon on his own and suffocating three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, claimed that his grandfather's actions were "a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that many people will give him."
The fans of mixed martial arts have stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent all night looking at a 206 well-filled Bellator, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San Jos√©, the event had 13 fights, including six on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, United Kingdom viewers were side by side when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to stay awake until early morning hours, especially for the fight.
A supporter on Twitter described the passage to animated drawing for children as "a kind of bad joke."
Regarding the transmission, the chief vice-president of marketing and communications to Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation states that at 6 o'clock in the morning, this content was not appropriate, so they had to move towards children's programs."
"Peppa the Pig", yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I believe that when I think about recasting, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we can't find a solution before Sunday our hour, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program went down, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government question.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more for fans and we have wasted everything.
This is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" in terms of sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of her sexuality - but this has given her the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize before going to high school that "everybody [was] not like me."
As part of the first radio show 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular broadcast presenter Kirsty Young took several months' leave because of his illness.
Appeared as a wreck in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "Today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength necessary for my success."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about their sexuality, he wanted to prove that it was "something," he continued.
The dual Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and has taken advantage of his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was expressing himself because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and thus wanted to restore "hope" to others.
The world's triple champion claimed that he "did not wait" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When we see so many things at such a young age" - he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he said that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had known the same high and low.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his entire perspective" had changed.
"If you questioned me last year, I thought only to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 as a result of brain cancer.
Daley confessed that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be seated in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him, "Father, you won't be here anymore to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he was dead to finally admit that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, this inspired him with his first choice of song - Heather Small's Proud - which accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the chicken flesh.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench Saturday
America's Phil Miccelson will record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get better to avoid it being a sad step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was disbanded by Captain Jim Furyk from the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the fifth large champion shared his day between the role of supporting and finishing his game at the stand in order to remedy his ills.
He has never been the biggest of the drivers, even at the top of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rush systematically punishes the wrong blows.
And as if the course wasn't redoubled in itself, Mickelson, during the ninth Sunday game, confronted Francesco Molinari, the winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, at four down at the beginning of the 12 simple matches, take a good start, the Miccelson match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a key in my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in him.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I expected more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we think we have to do it.
He wants to be there, like all the others."
On Sunday, Miccelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of Ryder Cup meetings.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never fully reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven demos, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
‚ÄúI think younger players had the pleasure of measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
He's doing a lot more than playing."
European selection captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the simple last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful journey.
The Danes held their first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesters had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally got up at the top of the ranking with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, taking it 141‚ÅÑ2-131‚ÅÑ2.
"You don't stop reminding yourself that we were leading a lot to Valderrama; we had a big advance to Brookline, where we failed, as well as to Valderrama, where we won, but fair," said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 Rating to win the 5-3 win both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to run 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Let's go down there tomorrow.
Go ahead and do everything you need.
It's not over before you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, namely trying to win this trophy, and that is where we need to stay focused.
I have always said I focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Ravi performances of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will be presented and everything else goes.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're tested at the height of your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message to get to the players, it's to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind, he must get the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have obtained three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these overhauls of the last day, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the "Miracles of Medina", where Europe took the win.
"I remember every word," he explains in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
"We have important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, exerts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have established our training accordingly and put the guys as we think they must do it, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of conducting the counterattack and will face Rory McIllroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole course," Bjorn said on his simple selections.
The new warship of Germany is still postponed
According to the local media, the new frigate of the German Navy should have been put in place in 2014 to replace the ships of aging war dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service by at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenditures.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesperson, the launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of all new frigates from Bade-Wurtemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have integrated the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems that occurred after delivery have undermined the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Bade-Wurtemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as a radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for a period of up to two years outside the docking ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the ongoing delays mean that the pre-war-guard vessels - which should allow Germany to project its extra-sea force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the ship yard Blohm & Voss, Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the warship unnecessary in the event of deployment to combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important because the Bade-Wurtemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is heavily overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the marine capacity to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons weigh twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of ‚Ç¨3.1 billion (3.6 billion), compared to 2.2 billion in the beginning.
The problems related to new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, recognized earlier this year that the Navy is in fact "short of vessels able to deploy".
The manager stated that the situation had resulted in a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessel was designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Bade-Wurtemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these single flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton in the Inverewe Garden in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key places around the property to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bats and the activities of different species.
A map and report on habitat will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of prairies and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perchours and results in the loss of their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as bite-killing papers and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as company cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to identify insects and obstacles to their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perchular inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Swedes of Scotland on the site of Threave in Dumfries-et-Gallow, which houses eight of the ten species of Swedes of Scotland.
David Thompson, domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threeave, we have an ideal place for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about bats, so that the work we do here and in other places will help us to better understand what bats need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of verifying the presence of bats before maintaining the properties, because by destroying without the desire of a single maternity nest, the death of 400 female and small, or even the disappearance of an entire local population, can be caused.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disturb them, or to destroy their paths.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish director of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our bats and about many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations for now."
Ronaldo refutes the accusations of rape while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the accusations of rape against him as "false information," and claimed that people "want to be known" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He would then have paid $375,000 for her to remain silent about this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
Addressing its 142 million fans in a live video on Instagram, a few hours after the spread of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, described this information as "false information".
¬´ No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false information," said the camera the fifth winner of the Golden Balloon.
"They want to do pub by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to pursue Der Spiegel about these allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy."
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation under "moral damage of a proportion to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the human rights of the past few years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel-casino le Palms, Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would have occurred, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo was kneeling after the alleged incident and assured him to be a "man well" to "99%" but he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they were consented.
Majorga also stated that she had gone to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "feared by reprisals" and feared "to suffer public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "forever regret" the departure of motor manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if it had lost its status as world leader in the construction of cars after Brexit.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in its Burnaston factory, near Derby, if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of border delays on the possibility of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis vehicles of Toyota, has built almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% have been exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that motor manufacturers qualify for risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in "tendu flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured by order.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, there could be border disturbances which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortage of coins.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory more than a day at her Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has turned out to be an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota had not been able to specify for how long the production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the United Union factory and who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a specific and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
La Maison-Blanche announces that Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rejected for a week", while the struggle for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser responsible for investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the possible barriers to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether Trump will return to the Deputy Attorney General, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he presented himself to the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump indicated that he would "want not" to send Mr. Rosenstein back, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week inquiry into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's press release, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if one week's withdrawal is still given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press informed."
The claim would be challenged by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conferences at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the scarcity of the lectures was not due to an aversion to "demagogic" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they break the gallery."
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without mentioning evidence, she added that "the president participates in more than any other president before him," "We have checked the figures."
Press conferences will always take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to question directly the President of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it frequently, you've seen it in recent weeks, and it's going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump also answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It's rare that there are solo press conferences.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times a bizarre appearance in front of the journalists gathered.
Regarding the fears concerning Brexit, the Secretary for Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer negotiations on withdrawal continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I estimate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities we need.
Scotland is exactly your home and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery
Ssilon Mike Organ, from Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennese Tigers second, was operated urgently after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the Chief Coach of the State of Tennessee, told the journalists that the injury had occurred just before mid-time.
"It came on the touch line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a street and taking it to another test.
A representative of the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center's operating room.
Harris explained that there was still no "information on the type or extent of injury" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five plates in total Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total of the season to 18 plates.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamps if they purchase property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people in the context of new conservative regimes
This will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury is expected to collect up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they purchase property in the United Kingdom - extra money will help the homeless, will announce Theresa May today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by committed to providing more affordable housing and targeting people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will serve to strengthen government efforts in the struggle to help homeless people.
This overtax - which has been added to the current stamp right, including the highest levels established two years ago on secondary residences and rentals - could be up to 3%.
Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 per cent of London's new constructions are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, thus raising prices and preventing first-party access to a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who live most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp right to help more young people acquire a first house.
Accusing large construction companies to maintain the prices of the property at a high level by taking over land without using it, he invited Ms. May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to address the " real estate damage" that exists in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for reform in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the removal of "unlawless" expulsions.
He would also like to advise the wider powers to build new housing.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house as well as for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become remote and the misery of homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's technician, Jack Ross, explains that his "last ambition" is to become the Scottish picker at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is pleased to meet the challenge of reborn the North-East Club, which currently occupies the third place of League 1, three points of the leader.
He rallyed the Stadium of Light this summer after he took St Mirren into the Scottish First League last season.
‚ÄúI had to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross said at BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But I grew up following Scotland's games in Hampden with my father and it's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only happen if I succeeded in managing the club.‚Äù
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's pickers are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former engineer of Alloa Athletic states that he did not hesitate to sit behind such emblematic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "Can I bring this club back to Premier League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it certainly belongs to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I wouldn't probably consider myself a success here if I could bring the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach in Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to go back to a third division and transformed St Mirren, who was on the verge of relegation, into a big winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
The takeover of Alloa "was probably a real crossroads," he recalls.
"I really thought being a coach was better than playing.
It seems strange because I got out of it, that I earned my life well, and that I took advantage of some valuable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There's a lot of details to deal with every week.

According to one survey, the perfect time for a paint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer canycule raised the revenues of the British pubs in difficulty, but increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
Figures indicate that bar and pub groups recorded an increase of 2.7% of their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants dropped by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, CGA's consulting firm, who compiled the data, said: "The longer-than-expected permanent insulation and participation of England in the World Cup have made the month of July follow the model of June, where the bars had increased by 2.8 per cent, except for restaurants, which have suffered even greater shock.
The decrease of 1.8 per cent recorded in June in the catering sector only began in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are used are by far the most in vogue, with more similarities than the smaller restaurants.
Food pubs also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as the restoratives.
Looks like people just want to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% per month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst on recreation and the RSM hotel, said: "These results have been following the trend seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in the out-of-home market sales.
It is no wonder that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% on an average annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continuing pressure on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have been less convenient for food business operators and time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will give a well-deserved rest."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the settlement.
Industry sales are monitored by Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion sterling and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, a child in five has secret accounts that he hides from his parents
According to one survey, one in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "main" account to show their parents
A five-year-old child - some of whom are only 11 years old - opens a social media account that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth of the "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20 per cent of students reported managing a "main" account cleaned to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally landed on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager who was urging others to "rape me".
According to the study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18-year-olds have a double profile, half of students grateful for their private accounts.
CSM Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers don't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Executive Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to make use of his extensive international experience over the last ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from his participation in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, where he won four gold medals and is now a regular commentator of the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had an AVC.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only the time would tell me if I would recover or at what point.
It was a hard job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I do exercises of agility!

On-line advertising on milk that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company offering a stripper compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called the "first silent milking in the world," Elvie, a large-public technology company, has launched an audacious publicity inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new milking striping offers to nursing women.
In a herd of cows filled with hay, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I betray myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's my breasts, not my nipples."
The refrain continues: "Pump it, pump it, feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, help women bring milk."
However, advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has triggered an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received conflicting reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth," wrote one of them.
Elvie's milking machine is adapted discreetly to a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It's a comprehensible trauma for the mother and baby.
But yeah, why don't you use them to advertise a handkerchief for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added: "An advertising so disconnected."
Others defended advertising, for example, a woman who admitted that she found the song "hilarant".
"I think it's an idea of genius.
I'd have bought one if I was still helping.
Pomper gave me the impression of being a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun commercial for mothers who pull their milk (often at their place of work or toilets) and feel like cows."
It is not an advertising that praises the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they have danced with the discrets to draw hidden beds in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the milkshaft say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie cane is completely silent, with no threads or pipes and quietly enters into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: "Elvie's lathe is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a daring and provocative launch.
By paralleling breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk is doing one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have quietly settled in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable. This is partly due to the fact that the Trump administration's harsh speeches and policies have made it possible to complicate the placement of children in respondents.
Traditionally, most of the respondents were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they feared compromising their own ability to stay in the country for the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons did not have legal records.
" Nearly 80 per cent of respondents or family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
According to refugee stakeholders, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities established new rules that would require some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will be compared by video conferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case with regard to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed not eligible will be promptly expelled.
According to the speakers and reports presented in recent months by the shelter network, the longer the children remain in detention, the more they may become anxious or depressed, which may result in outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large facility like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of his or her size, according to child rights defenders.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could heighten trauma that many have a hard time to manage.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw from the field.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "would be dealt with accordingly."
"They must retreat immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been torn from their homes.
He indicated that Damascus would continue "to carry out this sacred battle until all Syrian territories were purged" both of the two terrorist groups and of any "unlawful foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of which form and advise both the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem said about refugees, that the conditions were favourable for their return, and accused ‚Äúsome Western countries‚Äù of ‚Äúproducing irrational concerns‚Äù that discouraged refugees from returning.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would be concluded.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress of Idlib has led to further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and hoped that the military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the fighters of the Nusra Front, which are related to Al-Qaeda and that "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, claiming that the group's work should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and made a warning against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many Liberal viewers would probably hope, the removal and scandal led him to leave his presidency prematurely.
This would probably be "The most spectacular final of a presidency!"
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the "Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC, which reaches 3.5 million viewers during major evenings, is the first cable TV channel.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand," commented Neal Baer, the presenter of the ABC Dramatic Series "Designated Survival" that speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She recalls taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask him?
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has a funny value.
Obviously, unlike anything on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most successful viewers can afford.
And, however, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one finds himself watching for six hours a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear", on Paul Manafort's 15 000-dollar leather vestment ("a proud garment" according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered of, uh, the anatomy of Mr. Trump.
On my side, I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"If a part of what he does gives the impression of seeing a TV show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's changing teams and daily situation returns (to fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode if we're in the process.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at his house on the northern bank of Kauai, but he was standing inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand up, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was preparing to face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we had all these crazy programs and people said, "It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Foreign money invades the strongest half-manda elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of the electoral districts of the Congress that allowed two incumbents to dispute the same seat.
This recently restructured suburb of Pittsburgh is the seat of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who placed his seat in another constituency during the special elections last spring.
Lamb measures another licensee, the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which heavily overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated for Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district has led to a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congress Committee for Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory won just last March in a special popular election in the 18th district of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the 20-point victory in the district.
Politologists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing Salvador for its support for China and then withdrew
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not oppose.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the State Department decided to convene heads of US diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Department at the beginning of the month in a communiqu√©.
But sanctions were only planned against the Salvador, which received US assistance estimated at $140 million in 2017, including to control narcotic drugs and provide development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
While internal meetings were ongoing, representatives from North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from travelling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thereby ending any consideration of sanctions against the Salvadoran Government.
Vice-President Mike Pence now wishes to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats were informed.
And the three U.S. emissaries are quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Study History
The next title could be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also focus his investigation on the issue of a conjunction of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will be required to render accounts before this body, at the time he is ready to represent himself before the electors and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many "yes", and I do not pretend that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held its head and pushed the Czechoslovakians back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the following carnage years.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
The Americans are currently confronted with a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed to secretize the president and issued assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times report is inaccurate.
"What will we say if the recent investigation requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confined to the Supreme Court despite accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will ask Mr Trump for accounts?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will be a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light on Saturday candles on the table overlooking the swastika.
With this heritage in heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future.‚Äù

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, confidant in front of the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive null match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the League of Europe.
A knee injury has deprived the medium Graham Dorrans of its first participation of the season until the match null 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to get the best of such a result to realize exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," commented the 31-year-old attacker.
"We got into the game thinking about getting something, and we left with one point.
Perhaps we could have taken it to the end, but, overall, a null match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half-time and we returned in the second half-time and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they did a good result during their last game, but I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and changes to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; training is quality.
Let's hope we can move forward now, leave the last season behind us and succeed."
Women are no longer asleep because of this fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted them to be taken care of, few people referred to the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't do what they need to have this conversation," explained Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Branch.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children about this: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these costs.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with the value of repurchase to help you cover these expenses or other property insurance - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the passage.
Provide health care services that will enable you to identify a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a proxy for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure you pay your bills if you are incapacitated.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and visits to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"Is there not only the finance involved, but also the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place.‚Äù
A man was wounded several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
One man received several shots fired with a compressed air gun as he returned on foot from an evening.
The victim, aged 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove region of Ilfracombe, in the Devon, when he was shot in his chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2.30 p.m. BST, as a random act.
The victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries didn't threaten his life, and the police called for witnesses.
Seisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced to the authorities, and the balance sheet should run.
As communications were paralysed, relief services were unable to receive any information from the Dogalgaa Regency, an area located north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Dogalgaa, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, estimated to be 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dogalea is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) from coastlines to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, and particularly of the coastal region of Domgalea.
Pickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dogalga have been affected by tsunamis several times over a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dogalga.
A tsunami also hit west of Dogalga in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which took place on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that has deferred in 14 countries, bringing 226,000 victims on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude earthquake of 6.8 reached southern Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and caused nearly 700 victims.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude rocked the city of Padang, capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the earthquake and the 2004 deadly tsunami.
No tsunamis have been caused this time, but more than 100 people have been killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes shook the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands temporarily blocked tourists.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was questioned for suspicions of domestic violence, which contravenes a report of domestic and arrest-resistant violence, on a release published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone from a woman's knowledge that he was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is held under security security of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it is certain" when his plea was requested, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means that he could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a minor offence of Class B, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness related to the incident.
His companion had claimed that he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour with the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Seism in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died from the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing and the victim's balance sheet should be postponed in the coming days.
The earthquake was declared right off the centre of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the point of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami broke down on the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York essayist who has caused eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in that State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would have used a truck rented at Home Depot to attack a cycle track on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, on his pedestrian and a cyclist route last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide proof that Saipov has "intentionally" murdered the eight victims and inflicted "intentionally" serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to apply for the death penalty filed with the South District of New York.
These two charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this assault, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov to 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a careful preparation and a premeditation," the prosecutors claimed, calling the method used by Saipov of "hate, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South New York district had not claimed the death penalty for 10 years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed to engage in conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years that followed the cold war.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been urged to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the flag of Daesh in his hospital room, specified the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was obviously "disappointed" of the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than to accept his plea for guilt and to condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all interested," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilise the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former Party for the Independence of the United Kingdom indicated that politicians should "feel pressure" of Eurosceptians - as one of the Members of Theresa May suggested, he should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
Rear-ban Conservative MP Peter Bone said during the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom "would have been released already" if Mr. Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the dilemma to which Mrs May is faced to reconcile her deeply divided troops was emphasized by the Conservatives in favour of staying in the Union which joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty in maintaining his Czech compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The Allies stressed that they would continue their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would require Euroseptics and workers to choose between their programme and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leaves Leave to Solihull that he wanted "to get rid of Checkers".
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and that the burden of negotiations with Brussels should be entrusted.
"If he had been in charge, we would already be out," he said.
The Member of Parliament of Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not been given to world wars to submit ourselves.
We wish to make our own legislation in our own country."
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people turned the page and wanted to stay is completely false."
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in support of the release, was also present at the march to tell journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Anyone who is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who are slamming the streets and making us elected above all.
Abandon Checkers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honor their promises."
"Mr. Farage pointed out to the assembly that politicians should be called upon to "press pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the referendum of 2016.
"This is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They are trying to cheat the Brexit and we are telling them today: "We will not let you out like this."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel the pressure of our political class that is about to betray the Brexit.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that has enabled us to win the Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, pro-European followers walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of militants branded conservative banners against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
His working counterpart Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of the security issues relating to the implementation of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"They assure us that they are able to put in place computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to consider seriously the possibility of taking part in the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she will seriously consider the possibility of taking part in the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed Saturday's future at a public assembly in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequently critical voice against President Donald Trump, presented himself for the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, GOP representative in States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of speculation that Trump could face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the electors in a public assembly since Trump's performance.
One participant asked whether she intended to appear in the Chair.
Warren replied that the time had come for "women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman at the head of the state."
Arrested at the time of the death of Sims from the University of Louisiana
On Saturday, the Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by bullet from the Wayde Sims basketball player, a LSU basketball player, Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 a.m. Press conference.
On Friday, they had posted a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who was on the images.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot on Friday morning, near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims received a bullet wound in his head and suffocated to his injuries," Dr. Murphy J. Paul, police chief, told the media on Saturday, at 247 sports.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Questioned, Simpson admitted to finding himself at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the police station in the East Baton Rouge parish.
Sims, a 2 m-old man who grew up in Baton Rouge, had 32 games, of which 10 as a season last, and totaled on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton headed for the world title after the team's guidelines enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became evident as soon as Valteri Bottas qualified in anticipation of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and frowned Hamilton on the flank while he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the booths first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the storm at the peloton's tail, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes went through the booths a later round and found behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the advantage after a wheeled action that saw Ferrari's driver leave the inside at risk of resisting after a double attempt to defend in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21 years.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tires to target a speeding arrival and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived at the booths at the 44th tower, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight towers, Raikkonen slaming fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee, but he argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were "wrong, disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the Senate these last days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"By looking at the disclosures and leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you disclosed any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking of the Senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter from Ford in detail describing the allegations against Kavanaugh last July, and the disclosure took place early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein said to the committee, The Hill.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday night at the gathering: "I'm going to tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see wickedness, wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control," said the president in Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars wiped out their defeat of Friday in Elite League against the Giants of Belfast by picking up the match back 5-3 to Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality before Dwyer gave the Giants the advantage.
Fran√ßois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen does not enter two goals, ensuring their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday evening in Belfast, after being caught.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants who triumphed during the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage to the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass by Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the appointment four minutes later.
During a first well-loaded period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt turned to Cownie at 15:16, with equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advance before the first break when he struck his second goal of the evening toward the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard again matched with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the head for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus ensuring the victory for his team by marking a fifth goal at the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes during their next match Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board a plane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died and ensures that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many others disappeared after an important earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and many people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grande, he refused to leave his post in the violently shaken tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu airport.
He remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he felt she was going to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirat, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the country's disaster reduction agency indicating that access to the cities of Dogalga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to fade because many bodies were still under the debris and a large number could not be dried," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency
Waves measuring up to six metres have ravaged Palu who will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are piled everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, in charge of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?," CNN said.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that caused more than 550 deaths.
Aircraft Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man disappeared after the crash of a plane in the lagoon.
The airline that managed the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man is missing after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the flying aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a communiqu√© that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to more specific requests for information regarding the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local ships took part in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the aircraft hit the water by attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline stated on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft had landed in the lagoon near the landing runway.
Witnesses felt that the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others had been able to slip into the water until the aircraft's rescue came down.
he claimed that the on-board officers had panicked and screamed, and he suffered from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that the sailors who worked close to the improvement of a wharf had also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the mainland before the plane flowed in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 persons died in accidents by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the time of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its case on Saturday in the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the area of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls from a mobile phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night the accused died.
Rowlett indicated that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis was meeting with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers while he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another incoherence lies in the fact that Telllis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the SMS, calls and contact details of Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense must begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is the political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by engaging its music of positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the hip hop political again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?!
A New York Noun pursues a couple in court for having fired her after a "racist" text
A New York noun continued a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother who complained that she was "a still black."
The couple refuse to be racist, and equate the prosecution with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his dismay in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nonou, was Black upon his arrival for his first day of work.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORES A NOIRE," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding his gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman returned Mrs. Maurice, explaining that their former Noun, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Philippine instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work, then returned home by a Uber.
Now, Maurice continues the couple in court in order to obtain compensation for her return and calls for a $350 per day compensation for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired but without a contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do that kind of thing," she said at the Post Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to put an end to Maurice's employment, fearing that he could not be trusted after he had done something wrong.
"My wife sent him something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone with whom you were impolite, even if it was by mistake?
Your new baby?
Let's see!"
Likening the trial to an "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you pursue someone like that?
It is not a very pleasant thing to do," added the business banker.
While the file is still under way, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blame them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify themselves to a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It's hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very fun, knowing what we know about the huge success of Paddington."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a little bear in teddy bear, would remain optimistic in the face of the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a taste "twelfth-mother" after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and adds that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a rather calm man, and he wasn't a pretentious man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we are proud of him, even though it is not really his own realization.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
At the landing, her daughter had been taken urgently to Louis Pasteur 2 of Nice hospital, where the doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect it to happen," said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors had given him to maintain the heart rate were slowly exhausting and leaving his system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit here and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to take the shot."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, grieving of her daughter, rode on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this huge sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Women in mourning have postal cards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted, on a Welsh bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm forced to feel everyday," she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45 and staying at Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid there's a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go to see and to whom you can talk, even if he is a friend.
Do not keep silent - you must speak. ‚Äù
Ms. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Ms. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"He didn't say that he felt down, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we saw his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything.‚Äù
She said that her death represented a huge trauma for them, but they must get out of it: "It's tearing for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh involved as the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited investigation in time, limited in scope - we might be able to bring some unity," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "fall" into a partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will only take place in five weeks, or 6 November. If, as planned, the Republicans achieve a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the honourable senators and asked them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was then his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, currently sitting 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We still do not know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to leave the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of "fall" deserters under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un, seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that 1 127 desertions took place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs demanded by passengers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of Northern deserters will finally be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the very protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and often returns force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that remained pending.
This happened after the historic June meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the broad lines, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, imposed on US sanctions the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to engage in unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and declared he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview given on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee of Magistrates last Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited and sometimes broke screaming and suffocating by referring to his family and his school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling for the allegations of " grotesque and coordinated murder" organized by disappointed Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony had shown that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, since he had shown that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he disagrees with these statements himself and the way he took it to Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to detain Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and whether the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he's also incapable of sitting in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh raised the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect what we're saying: "It's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diarrhage, months and years of anger that overflow, and it can't get her out without crying.
"We cry when we're upset," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere, who told me that she too cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant."
The tears are allowed as exutory to anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I found myself crying from an inexpressible rage, was that I had been seized by the skin of the neck by an old woman - a cold director who had always a bit terrified - who led me into a stairway.
"Don't let them in any case see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They believe you are sad and delighted because they have had you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been taken into an extra-husband affair on board a boat called Monkey Business and had retired from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she entrusted me with laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing he missed was one more person.
Someone called it "Blanche-Neige and the Seven Nains".
As the campaign was very advanced, it had slowed down in fundraising, so it swore that it would not participate unless it had raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually donated $1,000 to men were only going to give her $250.
"Do they believe that I am entitled to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch official campaigns, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - that she felt uncomfortable about it.
"You would have thought that I was getting nervous," reminded Mrs Schroeder about the media's reaction to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
Did she cry?
How the trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China have been overwhelming, and although the battle is far from over, a conflict between countries could benefit in Beijing over the long term, according to experts.
President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth $200 billion US dollars (150 billion pounds), thus taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Every time, Beijing has responsibly responsibly recently, striking customs duties from 5% to 10% out of US$60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will suddenly vacillate.
Backing back to Washington is to yield to the demands, but publicly giving up to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, the experts believe that if Beijing can properly play its role, the pressures of the American trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could introduce conditions conducive to economic slowdown in either country is in fact much more dangerous than the observers previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research associate that focuses on Asia, the thinking group of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria expresses its readiness for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks assistance to rebuild this devastated country by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualm, said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations considers that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six more million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the insurrection.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the bar of 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Miccelson, who found himself in difficulty during most of the tournament, pushed his kick in the water at the 16th hole in par-3, giving up his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been excellent in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
America's Jordan Spieth was removed 5 to 4 by the least well-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, has tilted 2 and 1 to the English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the champion of Europe of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today, it's stronger than me.
It was an exciting year.
I'm so grateful Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cut back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it," Garcia was moved after the European victory.
He passed the flambe to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, last Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride, I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost his four games in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 in career in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the largest golfers of all time, which has found 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble all weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance regarding his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a certain time when we put pressure on Europe.
We've abandoned.
Hat Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have all played very well.
We're going to get together, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to bow.
We've gotten ourselves over it."
