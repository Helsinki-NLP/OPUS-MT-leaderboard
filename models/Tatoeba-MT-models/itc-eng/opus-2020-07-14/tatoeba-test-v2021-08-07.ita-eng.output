White pedone to f3, black pedone to e6, white pedone to g4, black woman to h4 - black chess! This is jokingly indicated in chess circles as "foolishness".
White: Tower in a1, pedone in b6, king in c8. Black: pedons in a7 and b7, king in a8, affix in b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the tower in a6, after that the Nero has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move its alfero in any other chess on diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White makes advance its pedone from b6 to b7 and gives boot mad. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pedone in a7, with the same result.
