The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the early fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in ČEZ shares reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of March, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it descended to approximately 6%.
The fall this time is due to the fall of the shares on Wall Street.
Here, too, the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote by the American Assembly of Representatives who refused to support the plan to stabilize the Secretary of the financial sector.
Loss of shares in Asia
The actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the index eventually mitigated some of the losses.
Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Index over its financial day marked almost four percent, although later it reduced its losses by reducing the decline in almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows the Chinese stock movements in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Sidney's stock exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses fell to a 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Index secretary went down to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions scheduled in the United States are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world," said the Head of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens to make falls feel in other countries.
Bloody bath of American shares
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the support plan for the financial system to which $700 billion should be spent (approximately 12 billion crowns).
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, the American actions lived a bloody bath and mainly the index of the actions collected the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The index of Dow Jones dropped to almost seven percent. A similar drop in volume was last recorded in 1987.
The index came down before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress retreats: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial assistance to the American finance system.
Your vote will take place early next week.
American legislators led to a gap in the talks on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, he is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and vote.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed on Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He said to Reuters agency, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee for Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a psychologically significant first factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, the "disenchantment" will be achieved through the complex mechanisms which will also be achieved in practice by market aid.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
"We've made a great move.
We have resolved our discrepant opinions with regard to how the package of measures for market stabilization should take place," Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with the Finance Minister, Henry Paulson, to give a definitive form to the Government Fund.
It should buy from financial companies the unsold mortgage assets that lead to severe losses and threaten system-wide stability.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
It's still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we're already on it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis expressly affects the rapidly falling market.
According to Senator Democrat by Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing their best to get Congress to approve a deal this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses in the Asian finance market as these are the ones in the first time slot and where Congress could influence the trade on Monday.
However, for now there is nothing clear about when the two cameras of the American Congress will vote, and not even if they will not be stuck at the last moment with some problem.
The legislators believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will suffer a number of changes.
The total amount to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion have to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme was not fulfilling its role, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush valued the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may veto this decision, but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was retained, which consisted of gaining financial resources for the purchase of bad mortgages whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and that he appreciates "the commitment of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armoured contract
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, chief of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility for the program's money for the protection of taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a relief closure of the planned financial plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called armoured contracts for directors of participating companies, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made a great move towards the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also has to help home owners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of the payments on time of the debtors and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological aid
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be crucial for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"A lot more important is that, as of this week, the congressmen agree on their support and give you your good visa as much as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to reach that approval is now the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Armed struggle: MP3 Player against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
What seems clear is that it's better to buy just the phone.
Still there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on how they are used and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for you to acquire the most modern record to listen to in it the last album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP disks no longer go out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to keep buying them.
If vinyl discs with rock, jazz or blue music are crowded on their shelves, at least he's probably dreaming of this type of record.
This is the same with the music that is on its way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music on MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the commercial helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each.
The choice is broad.
It also decides the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get a lot more than just playing music and even that which not even most mobile.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most basic functions such as telephoneing, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera and you can even navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDAs they're going to have in their pocket also a small computer.
This is a small miracle because no fridge knows how to make a grill and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone before the screen indicator will be illuminated by calling for reloading.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy tragons.
Few are the mobiles that can play music more than ten or twelve hours, most of which are much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have greater performance.
Therefore, note that cheap mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above, they constantly call themselves yet, for more security, a shipper for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have to have it, as even the worst lasts at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when you record music on your mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and not all of them can connect directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced reader units can connect the small memory cards that are used on the mobiles.
In players, with any exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through your computer's USB.
Most mobile phones and players create their order alone in the music library according to the name of the interpreter, album title, gender or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a tree structure directory similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
The player tries to use, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific team is interested in the strength of the accumulator, the capacity of memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as on the tram, then it is enough with any mobile that reproduces.
What almost really gets any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 reproduces it all, and virtually all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is one of the most extended and except for it the absolute majority of the devices reproduce music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and your iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
Simply use the mobile internet to visit the operator’s competent pages (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could in itself be just a weight argument to acquire a mobile phone for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most are confined only to the subjects of radio fleet success.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (either via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always wear a cell phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find your mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always wear headphones or at least handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every mobile, even if at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of a classic headphone entry.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as telephones equipped with an entrance of 3.5 mm. for some classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really handles any person.
The minimal functions, their management similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the phonographs are evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, giant account for data loss.
By which apparatus to be decided
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a proper card will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
Basic models are normally only equipped with a maximum capacity 2 GB card.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy still a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on capacity (maximum 2 GB) there is no need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding lovers of music to hand over the most specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line phones have almost the same use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category as price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most cited brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer almost all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, who would force those to be cheaper.
Probably won't be long to get there.
That the Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed this by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is of the most expensive in the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulating roaming fees, it is likely to reach a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS sending from abroad will be cheaper than if sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This is probably paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is an extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTú), Pavel Dvořák, has already said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be quite difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant drop in prices before which classical operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the Britain market, voices similar to here and there were heard.
It has been shown that there is room for this type of operator and that they can be successful.
On the other hand, there is no need to look for too far-reaching examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to get over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
In addition, to enable them to function effectively, it is enough for many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that however, it often counters with the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Mobile Tesco in Britain offers at least half of cheap SMS with respect to competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to bet on a trivial target group.
This operator is specifically addressed to man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if it looks like the concept of Poland could catch up in our country.
The spokesman for Vodafone, Miroslav Čepický, therefore doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover from the point of view of the supply of services is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be any virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We're talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in Czech R. doesn't seem too hopeful.
Rather it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," he said in telephone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, he ensured that current mobile telephony operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition.
Interested about the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows it by the GTS Novera group that I would like to take a further step to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, in order to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile telephony operators.
With some of them we have been able to make progress at the meetings," said the group spokesperson, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe they'll shine better times.
It seems that, for non-official information, the first official operator would probably have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has been addressed to us with some complex and serious project in this field," he said for mobile.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesperson of Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market concerns other operators.
The T-mobile spokesman, Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2's opinion, adds: "We have not yet registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
And he adds: "On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find some virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some specific contract that would be possible to study on such short horizon"
Vodafone directs its attention rather than meeting the requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this is about the distribution of expenditure and infrastructure.
We consider this precisely as the greatest input from the customers' point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on mobile."
Responsible offices - with uña and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a price drop and thereby a drop in profits.
Then why facilitate the entry to the competition?
When the operators want to get something, they are able to pull off the same rope, proof of it is the agron when U:phone came up.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on the ČTÚ was at the time of U:fon's entry by the T-Mobile society.
It testifies to the public information accessible on the websites of the ČTÚ.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds this: "Evens, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile telephony market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that another player's entry into the market would be for him and, above all, for his large requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute uninterest of the Czech regulator.
This is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Licensing (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical stance on this issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator was closed.
So far no agreement has been closed since the offer of potential stakeholders rather was not interesting enough for classical operators," added our question Kristian Chalupa, from the UOHS External Relations Department.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices to represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, apart from that, they should observe that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "On the outside where virtual operators work normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the price drop of mobile telephony services"
Of course, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and price drop does not fall within the interest of UOHS.
It's really dramaticly shocking in all this case is the dishonoring reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in gas stations because it is clear that it is a work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding rise in liability in their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," he added to his response Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is clearly a relevant market analysis developed by the ČTú that telecommunications is from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile telephony operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must be necessarily dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for UOHS should represent a warning the fact that three mobile operators ascend in a similar manner.
The current complaints from stakeholders (injured by GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with operators they are collapsing with many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility in the ČTú is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the UOHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We've already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was introduced recently to expand the competition of the ČTú in the field of trade tenders that did not take effect, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be well known by the representatives of UOHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when nobody looks
At the same time, unavoidably it still works as well as a pseudoviral operator that on the Czech mobile telephone networks there already exist a few.
They are companies that put their own prices to mobile telephony services which, however, only one part are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few elected get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the company in charge of a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will later receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases were discovered such as those cited could be referred to under the terms of contract that could be translated at the end of collaboration with the given society," he answered the question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity by mobile telephone operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned above, they can become thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they gain nothing despicable and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows such a speculation, however, the services of this company are only used by so many percent of customers.
These must also accept that the SIM card on your phone is not on your name so you cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the operators."
Precisely this is what should seem to the least strange ČTU.
There is also a new question for UOHS.
If mobile telephony operators surround their eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover these types of activities and if it is not going to want to be satisfied with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, almost in all countries where the virtual operator emerged, classic operators tried to protect themselves from this eruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, perhaps too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases have defended operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure, they made the first virtual operator emerge and with it began to emerge more.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all of this happens as if it were a burning nail.
We cannot help but be impressed by the confusion of powers in these cases.
But let's not despair.
If this information between behind the scenes is correct and the virtual operator actually gets to these lands, then the Czech market of the mobile phone probably starts moving again.
If any of the operators let any virtual mobile telephony operator enter it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the day of official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, my home.
The new anthem recorded it by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one by male voice and another by female voice, another by Coro and another instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are responsible for the singing.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek sees this Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chose for solo singers with representative young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with both of them and then, also, with the Choir that were fixed in the saying so that the text would be well understood, so that it would have consonance," he said.
The Czech official anthem celebrates next year on 175th anniversary.
The song Where, my home played for the first time in 1834 in the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
It won popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The MHD in Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transportation Company the date on which the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can now be purchased by nearly one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day bonus and the annual bonus (this will be valid as from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously upload it to their chip card at the infocentres and positions of the transport company at Metro stations, Muzeum, Městek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Bonuses can be purchased from yesterday's internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of trade can definitely start to forget the ticket sales posts at the metro stations, where until now they have to make regular queues to take out a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased on the Internet, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a window with trained staff that helps those interested in internet shopping and also with the recharging of the bonus purchased on your card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to reload the e-bony in the Opencard on the automatic exponent machines found in some subway halls.
How are these exponent machines?
They are red, they remind us of a pick-up machine and travelers will probably have already set themselves up at the Roztyly metro stations, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city, but at the end of the year there would have to be 80," Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just enter the Opencard chip card into it and the bonus previously paid will be charged only on it.
The electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In other words, in the roundabout trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus area," explained the ticket control, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which establishes the schedule of the public transport of Prague.
Surrounding buses have their reader cards mounted on the driver's locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard at the place intended for it on the side of the box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not travel on Circulation buses and do not remember when they are finished the bonus's validity can go to the outgoing machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. referendum
In 1945, the German Sudetes called for Fumaba to be part of the United States.
This is what is drawn from the letter that is stored in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, some German groups from the Southeast were allegedly addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It results from the cards stored in a particular file and are currently stored in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "earth Šumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as deliverers" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts".
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the south-east Germans is presumably - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors appeal in the letter to the American president who assumes today and forever to Šumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all contributes to the victory of the allies," the letter says.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals of the "Czech Oppressors".
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted about this idea of Germans šumavos, it would suffice to organize a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under their patronage.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of the post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some experts, well-drawing the expectations of the south-east Germans of that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to be minimally persuaded that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate for the Southeast some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
Even Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born České Budějovice, confirms this.
This was in the war, as a German of Budějovice, enrolled in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war the British arrested him and put him in Holstein's prison camp, dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought when they came home, the Czech would come well," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the decrees of Benes would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think--pays!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way, it could be characterized by the emotional campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Media Transport on Wednesday.
The minister's office, Aleš .ebíček promises to deter drivers from dangerous behaviour at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, internet and brochures.
You should dissuade the driver from high speed and alcohol to the steering wheel.
And also to remind you that before you start running, the belts are attached.
He wants to get to the consciousness of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and ultimately also professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that embitter emotions.
And for this we are testified by the "blood" announcements throughout the campaign:
Don't think--pays!
The word "Do not think" is written with great letters in the plate.
And in a blood tank is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man can come to pay with his own life at a time of distress.
The announcements are going to "meet" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign on Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that it will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and milk for drivers
"For drivers the sugar and milk system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and it saves time.
Latigo is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says the transportation psychologist at the hospital Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
And that's why we need an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity campaign, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of some danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," said Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas for peace
The president of the Israeli provisional government, Ehud Olmert, pronounced on the restitution of practically all the occupied lands in 1967, i.e., the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
I proposed in the interview that appeared on Monday in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we must necessarily return almost all the lands (occupied) if not all of them," Olmert said to the daily.
"I'm sure we'll stay with some percent of these lands, but the Palestinians will have to yield a percent (of the land of Israel) to them because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the case of restitution, this would also be included in Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as he passed on to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city where several dead and tens of people were wounded.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, a sacred and historical place" located inside the ancient city.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he insisted later.
Retreat of the Golán Highs
Olmert also pronounced himself for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Highs, which, from his point of view, is an inherent condition to close a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know well what they'll have to take off to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hizbula (the Shia Movement), they must withdraw from the continuing support that causes the terrorism of Hamas (the Shia Movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the prime minister realized.
Questions after the accident: Are peas illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In relation to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises that if the Azafatas and passengers can move along the bus during the trip.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of the Azafata is opposed to the traffic law," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old Azafata died last week, evidently was caused by the driver of the truck only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less safe place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly stop, and at the very moment the Azafate distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here is what plays the paper is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long distance buses of Student Agency do not have places to stand, which confirmed the company's director, Radim Jančura, to Aksuálně.cz.
"This has been resolved with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was removed and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat," he told us.
Azafata doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the Azafata - no legal provision clarifys this function.
Not even any legal provision forbids transport agents to perform any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds the spokesperson Hanzelka less frequently.
The Director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks otherwise that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have on foot sites.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided among urbans, where there are places to stand and at maximum speed, interurban with places to stand with higher speed permission and those of long distances without walking sites, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with safety belt.
As on the plane, says the expert
The expert from BESIP in Transport Security, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems with the movement of the Azafate on the bus.
"During the development of the journey there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to service on planes.
Even here you don't have the assurance that the turbulence will come and that the saffron can be hit on your head."
"However, if the bus suddenly slows down the physical laws.
The same as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The security of the Azafata must be resolved by the rules of procedure of the transporter," he says, and he also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier offering thezafat service.
He employs two hundred.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, at the moment you have the impression that the Azafata post is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, on entering.
It would save even expenses," she says.
In the interest of safety is the reason that Asiana lacks sodas in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have saffrons, we're against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A Tragedy Ended
In the line accident that joined Naples, a young Pilsen Azafata who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably rotated from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried to avoid it in a quick maneuver, however, hit the front right.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the break of the Azafata were sold.
"These sites are not possible to book for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck.
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the trial on compensation for the girl's family, but wait for the financial expenses also for the guilty party.
Law Reform?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring more precision on the Azafata movement on the bus in which for one year thirty experts have been working on a group of members of the Ministry of Transport.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They do not devote too much to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile during the march," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the Azafates to be an important threat to the safety of passengers," concludes spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
The hope of Dusseldorf is supported in Frankfurt
In the letter from the West LB Board of Directors for its collaborators, there are no big words.
By merging the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank, a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group can be formed, as it says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the `competition block' with sustainable profit capacity, would enter that business.
Moreover, such a merger may be a start for further mergers in the area of regional banks.
That is how the text is understood, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the federal financial services monitoring institute which has recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also from Frankfurt, there is much talk about such a link between the DEKA bank, that Sparkasse customers know about their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, let him know that he does not see any sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the Board of Directors of DEKA, which is now composed of the regional banks and the Sparkassen associations, commissioned the Board of Directors to start negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time that this is about consolidation in the area of Sparkassen, the name of the DEKA bank, which with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
Only the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against the participation of Helaba in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But last Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba Board of Directors, said that he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that, it seems clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
When the Bavarian Parliament elections are going to be held, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba that doesn't necessarily turn out to be good news.
If pressure continues to merge, Helaba will lack partners to achieve that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it has been far better off than the financial crisis the Stuttgart and Munich buildings did.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided the plans of coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, there is only the North LB.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a commercial model that could guarantee the future for the regional banks, to which deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end, the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter from the bank's board of directors, it is said that a complete solution would be sought for the whole bank.
As you can compare the coexistence between unique parts of the bank with DEKA, that's going to show the time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, he attends Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything looks different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5 liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, at 23:45 tonight, three buses go out, towards Munich, the party of the beer, expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are mainly planned for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking next to his flag are singing the South Americans, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, Marco Guarda says, which is nothing to the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-coloured pads, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have come to Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the road there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the turn.
spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to Bavarian purity law, sickness insurance and German guide- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the address "Brenner"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the quiet reigns on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
It stands for Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration make another break on the 8-way shortly before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group is scheduled to arrive at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Mark has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "knowing the way.it".
Second: "When you open the doors of the tent of the campaign, that means walking!", he screams at Marco in the morning.
"March!" Go and occupy the back sites in the campaign store.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all with yellow hats don't sit in the same bench, distributed all over space!"
One litre of beer, rue Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
Just get out of your place, he'll be busy by now!"
Third: "This afternoon at exactly ten and a half you have to get here!" Did you understand?
And now everyone goes to Octoberfest.
One, to mark the road, even yellow caps on trees, traffic signals and even on a poster of the elections of a large People's Party of Bavaria.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Octoberfest that is known as "the weekend of Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; these are 50,000 people who make the trip on the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend of Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistics of the nations present, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and Austrians occupy the first place.
The preferred Italian campaign shop is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of the Hippo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, with the federal finance minister Peter Steinbrück accented only last week.
Well, the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate finance, which is quoted in the DAX index, receives from a consortium of the German banks a credit of one billion to be able to withstand the turbulence on the market.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hippo Real Estate is going to use has to throw interest.
Money comes from private banks also from those of public law.
The cause of this is the loss of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to one report, state finance with the money that was provided for long-term projects financed only a short period of time - which is now no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of the year, the bank's cash capital reserve fell by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, and the own capital share also delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared with the same period last year, the continuing revenue from financial investments and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, the debt-deposit revenue for debtors and some securities also from the dissolution of credit assets fell by more than 70 per cent in 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and many revenues of reimbursements for the compensation costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the repayment of interest according to the federal tax code and organized business for consortium companies, the negative balance could cause a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatisation in 1990 the former state finance at the beginning was lost in speculations with industrial loans for the buildings, which was a reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
Since no money could be made with the financing of State projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors and as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to carry out depreciations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of the group's losses and profits, it is said very imprecisely.
It's a fact that dividends have been canceled.
By 2007 they were cancelled to two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, the Hippo Real Estate became an important state and financial finance in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own the customer deposits, it, compared with other banks, proves to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credits dropped essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost EUR 50 billion to finance a portion of the Defa credit portfolio of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hippo Real Estate report, the bank covers with credit the need for group funding for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international monetary markets that are now essentially not capable of functioning"
Other sources say that this money guarantees refinancing until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, President of the Royal Estate Board of Directors, explained that the Hippo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the federal financial services monitoring institute (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Royal Estate Group has now been secured.
That's what stockholders and bank creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
But the case cannot be ruled out.
He ran the voice that at the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary salvation can not at least reassure concerned people.
The price of action fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts are almost unchanged, courses of loans according to the position in the property registration clearly tend to be low.
Affected are mainly the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hippo and rightly the loans whose maturitys exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth in the bank crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hippo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are underaffected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime they can start from the amortization of pensions in the long run.
Or something is going to happen, which can't be imagined - the financial crisis is going to be over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-sectional news about partial statization, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleeping, breaking their heads on the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put the end point and use the new account transport of the losses for future compensation payments of benefits on change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at the High School in Tajikistan, the girls began to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go by train 40 minutes to the Highschool Tajikistan.
Sola had to find the way, luckily I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not set as rigorously as in my home in Baja Saxony.
From eight o'clock in the morning the students come, at nine o'clock, a small meeting starts with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had come to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not a person who speaks very gladly in the audience, especially before a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put myself to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayona Wo She Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this point, I was very happy because I had been studying this language for two years now.
All 31 girls in the class have knifed, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "Kawaii"
I already knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I quickly disillusioned myself on my site.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the girl in exchange had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really robbed.
Everyone talked at once, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recreation everyone took out their Bentos.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else that boring pieces of German bread.
He had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu mass meat.
In most cases I have no idea what this is like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of seagulls in the salt, buffff!
In Japanese schools the bandages are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a very artistic gift for a boy and gives it up in hopes of getting to know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read in my Manga Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally, for years I've preferred to read Mangas.
To better understand comics and culture, one day I began to study a little Japanese.
To me it was absolutely certain that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a flak by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a harsh, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can it be controlled if they, acting in a way similar to us, feel the same?
In an Internet journal called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or someone else could prove it so far, even though we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we devote ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown field because hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same as the other animals: the dead is made, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, of which some scientists draw conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contaminate our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and the executive functions that lead behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in the linguistic nature of man: As most of his experience is united with the tongue, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as a whole, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, does not allow it to be measured because it has special hardware, nor is it allowed to analyze through our experiences, so your research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of the consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short-term primate memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essential thing is rather to the neutral correlations of consciousness than causal mechanisms: Both can be similar or not.
Curiously, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what's the result of that for the sensations?
I owe the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated which is responsible for that, the same as with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex that distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, fine sensation classifications continue because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to be able to describe the states of others by ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for body feelings and brain trunk, as Jaak Pankseep thinks, but is more focused on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their feelings.
For theoretical reasons, I can't go against that, but I don't think it's likely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, it may feel in two cases too: But how can it be controlled if rats and men behave in a similar way?
Seeing the danger of a cockroach escapes, maybe because it's scared?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behaviour does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That's true that the neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have brain trunks that are similar, the shells on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even when it is possible to prove it for men: How can it be proved in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also the cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to be fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and the tongue).
In any case, progress is expected in the field of neurology as the same is measured by rats and men.
Since I don't investigate the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward rather than work continuously without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: grace deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said that the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of Ukraine's ability to organize Europe's championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is a lot to do in both countries."
The hours of construction and reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries are well placed.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste more time.
We now have to do jobs at great speed," said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA won't take our eyes away."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from it."
Only in the last season many clubs in the first division were condemned because of manipulation in descent to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Counterattack for Dennis Quaid outraged
She wanted to promote a new film, she spoke in an interview about private life - and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adult.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses in the former pair of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after her divorce.
The reason for revealing private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unhearless that Meg tells how many times the history of our relationship in another version," said the 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News."
Among other things, it is very "lasable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will remember in public the pain and the changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently is twins' papa.
And so he ends with his statements pointing out: "No matter how my life goes on.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
Prices for plane tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, plane tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany became cheap up to 50 percent.
Flight tickets and overnight stays in hotels were made again cheap - this is the result of a study by the travel service provider and the financial services of American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter it found a major change in the second half of 2008.
After prices on the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays on many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe rose to 6.9 percent on average between January and March.
From April to June prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent comparing last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause that "the interests of the U.S. tourists in travel decreased."
The decline in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannóver, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices increased to 26.3 per cent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first trimester the prices of plane tickets also showed the upward trends:
Due to the increase in the prices of kerosene, travellers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of the plane tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more remarkable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, in the second semester they dropped to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for national flights to Germany even halved.
The cause of price change is on the one hand the rise in the weak economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition through the Open-Skies Treaty which liberalises the traffic of aircraft between the US and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that declared in the first half of 2008 in bankruptcy - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him is not yet going to make the tenth goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of the player of the national Marko Martin selection.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to make a goal.
All he wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, he could clearly read it from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," silbaba Hermann Rieger in the cabin entrance to Hamburg Stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over, and most of the present were again in their places.
Rieger was almost three decades physiotherapist of the HSV, and has a great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That's why your request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded his head and raised his fingers in a sign of nocturnalness.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the main coach in Hamburg.
His order was the same: well, the second goal!
But that was not done.
"Today everything was not nice to see," added Marcell Jansen later.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have him "more relaxed."
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petrik (11) with its head impact; and also to the situation that the Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday, the SV in Hamburg is going to be in his 121 years.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky on the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It provides that the partial qualifications of the table correspond more to the speed of the alloy than to the dominance of its HSV.
The quipo with its players forced late as Brazilians Neves and Silva, the petric swallow as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but still the chipo can't shine with their successes.
"We need more than feeling and driving," Jol says.
After the vote has been defeated
The Wall Street spreads fear.
The first news about the failure of the bank rescue package dropped a certain period the Down Jones at 700 points.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in his history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little bit.
About 20:30 one of the largest barometers in the world scored a 5 percent deficit in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser at the Dow Jones were American Express that lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs' shares lost almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a great investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The rescue plan plans to make available resources to buy so-called "podrite" mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid by stroke but step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the receipts of action options for financial associations that can be charged during the course development to reduce the financial burden of the state box.
Action courses in Europe and the US continue to fall
One billion aid for banks in Europe and the United States does not reassure investors.
The course of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate's actions is low and has a negative impact on the Dax.
Despite the saving of the financial market projected by the state, the U.S. index Dow Jones continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of the Hippo Real Estate and the Commerzbank caused the drop in the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the saving actions of the federal government and private banks, the actions of Munich's real estate finance a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6000 points and scored a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
Around the world, financial markets suffered a fall.
The opening of the Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the 700 billion-dollar life package of the U.S. government is not enough to give impetus to financial markets.
In the first hour after opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent until it remained at 10,809.25 points.
The House of Representatives of the United States wanted to vote on the draft salvation, which could be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia the Japanese main index Nikkei after benefits fell to 1.26 percent in 11,743.61 units.

After the announcement of capital expansion the shares of Arcandor lost in the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim signed 23 million new actions.
Moreover, the commercial and tourist consortium announced that the shares in Thoms Cook company will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the path of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused the disenchantment of researchers: the Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are warming up now, he's threatened with death in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during gravitational assistance to maneuvers, has caused confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver in the trajectory of space probes while they get an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: missiles do not behave by 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravity.
They're more frequenting speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
Physicians could not explain this effect until now.
They called it anomaly during gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that perhaps even the general Theory of Relativity of Albert Einstein describing the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what were left of astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for anomaly can be the Dark Matter which can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers of the universe know the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
Supposedly she has the attraction force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, the Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of the rescue.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back at the point of attention of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper reports on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are seen as being released.
In that regard, the same information presents Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news on liberation at the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'Now we control their health," said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, reports state Egyptian television.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was only about "receiving hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, the Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them detained in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded the rescue from Germany of six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife to one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, kidnappers intend to release female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a secure route to flee.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Patron abuse "leaded to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse for his stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro Royal Court, through an investigative study, knew that he regularly had bound his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court knew that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and sell her eyes before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working on a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to Cornwall.
Her daughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Ms. Randle, who used much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Mrs. Rande's friends had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "renunciated life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that was concluded by saying, "I used to tie her up and blindfold her.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, it is that if she hadn't done it, the issue probably wouldn't have ended in the courts."
And he added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother there was abuse on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with the loss of data
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
Surely it is the less serious position under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
The BBC correspondent for the Frank Gardner Defense said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause on the safeguard of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of over £80,000 after the rescue/salvation of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect deposits of the 2.6 million bank savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humbling" that societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be reimbursed after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest due on the internal market is assumed to be charged to the 700 financial companies holding deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will be £450,000 in 2009.
This implies that societies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Trade Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions who behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less cautious."
According to BSA, no data indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options there are for protecting construction societies and their members in front of what might be a relevant price," Mr. Cole added.
The interest gained in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, this will be a full year of interest payable, which may be almost twice as high.
As the construction societies of each other's organizations and as there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk rises from five pence per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey Strait will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence the liter from next Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and then the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the milk price had increased before February was 2002.
The former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladesh court has rejected the bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His advocates said that the court did not grant bail by accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various charges of corruption against you.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail early this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the militaryly supported government grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while he was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of his release are or whether he will be able to remain free when he returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina claiming that she could not get bail because she was already on treatment abroad on parole," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"Let's appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
His advocates argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after 17 October, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, supported by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan, says the UN, have not been able to take advantage of a recent campaign of anti-polyomielitic vaccination because of the violence of the Taliban.
Last week the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesperson said that despite promises made by the Taliban that would not have attacked or obstructed thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision forcing the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its participation by 17.9% in ITV below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests impede competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, to buy ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopolie Bureau reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV participation raised doubts about ITV independence, and encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, he commented that the obligation to reduce his ITV package was unreasonable and was a disproportionate remedy, particularly because BSkyB said, he would have delivered his voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of state lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of the officials of the administration.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Several allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their offices by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was assumed that lawyers had not been assessed worse than their colleagues, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had been working on the persecution of Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and may be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned from his position.
A number of other members of the Department of Justice did the same.
The General Prosecutor's report is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for dismissals, which "abdication" of his leadership position and was "notably uncooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epic of Meat Loaf of Much Honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special prize next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album by which Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group is taking the nominations for this year's awards and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that go beyond time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
A two-minute instrumental section opens the hymn.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell from Meat Loaf remained for about nine years in the rankings and came to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation due to cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a breakdown during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it appeared that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready to sell
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous ones, others simply of service.
However, many people, including senior taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of the Primera Calle – before I found the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active road.
There are no signs.
It is virtually impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings at the Primera Calle
that wants to revive Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and shops that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-time neighbours who commented they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the past of the block before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Community Venture Committee for Land Use this month, the representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring that the street remain in the city, requested a new plan to be submitted next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community, said n.3.
"The city is owned today by very few spaces and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea Avalon could buy the street first emerged during this month's meeting
but Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that despite the company's desire to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned alley and the possibility of making it a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is the development of property rather than the management of the property.
Compared to its more coloured surroundings, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps better known for the photograph of the establishment that rises in the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took out the photograph in November 1976.
"I was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about East Village's burgering, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, which are still modest, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, almost without change, a king of the city that should be protected.
Jérémie Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk in the history of the city on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow street and without exit, also dark for the day and marked by doors of oxidized iron warehouse and counter-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blowing along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was healed through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now it hosts a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but they suggested that she could be cleaned.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its present state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Classes School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are the example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transition bilingual education" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English, is effective in eradicating the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school, the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
more than one-third of students, many of whom have just arrived, are learning English.
However, an amazing 100 percent of the fourth year's students, has been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam.
and almost one equally amazing 93 percent has dominated the English and arts language test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama favored.
Sixth Street School emphasizes the review and practice, the constant assessment of competences and does not tolerate any excuse attitude.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of the Sixth Street, the school's focus on teaching English to students is on "total immersion".
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposed bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who has arrived from Mexico and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later, you will not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating from other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the response, but the idea of the politicians of your party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been defenders of bilingual education) and their continued support for bilingual education obscures Mr. Obama's prediction of the response.
While it is true that immigrants must learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the question by letting people stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English
and instead, he said, "you should make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Raw oil shares decreased by 7 percent to $99.80 in the morning negotiations at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before reversing, once again, because of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety was taken over by investors, once again on Monday, despite the leaders of Congress who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the greatest in history.
The news was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, as the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said that in the frenetic weekend negotiations leading to the rescue agreement "they do not seem to have been able to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, there is a reduction in demand for commodities, including oil.
"The prospects for global equity, interest and exchange rates are going to be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread worldwide and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, such as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and forecasting the reduction of oil and gas prices is 20 percent by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team set record
After having spent the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things developed on the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a party without annotation into a game of disinflation.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with Persianness under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point, it happened that the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranues Coles achieving a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect precaution for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of these when a cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were in the prison, the defense of the Cardinals was being abused at the Kurt Warner quarterback.
The Darrelle Revis cornerback intercepted a running shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last shift, the faults forced by Bowens, might have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a definitive 34-0.
It's the bigger points the Jets never did in a room.
To Team Coach Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second room much more than the third.
They've won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Restless Gebrselassie leads its world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated that many consider him the greatest runner in history, overcoming his own world record in the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After victory in the comfortable field race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established the world record number 26 in a race of impressive length so it has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the race counterlock to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate its problems with asthma.
Instead, he was pointed to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using on average a few cutters 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselasie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebselassie told journalists that she had suffered cramps two weeks before and had lost a week of training.
Clearly, the suspension left him fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told the journalists.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been the object of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the Afro-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, based on the pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting the record ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of the skills of Gebrselasie as a runner.
This Sunday, on the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselasie after their pacemaker decreased.
But just before three miles from the goal, Gebrselasie took a last impulse to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathai arrived in third place at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also took part in the Beijing Games so it was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set up her best record staff in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation career, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya ended third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of colour life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometres from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Eatonville Fair to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist to share their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and does not know what is going to be lost."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outside.
"We are very careful about the way our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a resident of the entire life and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of blacks' assertion and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the South Black - sometimes denounced, others praised - that was born of slavery in America.
It's no wonder, if those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as no one here calls it Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten into the history of blacks and human drama.
With both face of cement in life as much as in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road on the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, care for Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts in relation Eatonville to the autonomous government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Evidently, this Fodor wasn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a live eccentric that returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in the city, she did so without prior notice in a great Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to dress with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many were laughing sarcastically.
"People are always very happy to see Zora," continues Mr. Franklin.
But he added, balancing himself in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten it.
Although he was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large commemorative ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think his contribution to the world or his inheritance was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-road road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main street of the labor community.
The expansion of Orlando's area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, inter alia, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mixture brought hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys went around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next door," said Mr. Franklin.
"They also killed a girl once.
They threw him into a car hose."
In a letter from 1955, Mrs. Hurston wrote in The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "it was insulting rather than honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the segregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of their young people.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because I was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with sloppiness, trust and lines like: "How can one deny to himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, a acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing it into American canons.
The road project came right at the time that Eatonville's most famous daughter was again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the road five ways would have been to put on what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd said more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
Outside town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (bearing the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006 on a refurbished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can sometimes feel like in a street in the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
To An early permission is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things - like the murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker, fool and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of the 18-year-old nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, who planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-olds from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare to go up here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at your story, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone talks about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed far from the kiosks and the giant television screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the bee nest offices above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York daily face the worst "bad office day" since the fall of 1929.
Boys for home delivery keep resounding their metal carts for tea through the sidewalks and carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between buildings of loaded apartments, as well as human mules, with 50 eccentric print shirts hanging on a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their food to take off in the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees are still waiting to queue for their bagel to the vendors' carts, and it is however impossible to find a taxi between four and five afternoons on the day of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although it had calculated the time required for the operation to coincide with the calm of the end of the afternoon in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to remove your cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer's service bank, where the customers of all life order their check counters, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's large stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "trusted personal banker," and they were in queue for the same reason that I did.
Unlike me, still, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places from where they had been switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had drawn their money from the so-called savings associations (a little like a construction society), from the credit unions and savings boxes in their home city whose whites only work within the state of belonging, and that they say treat customers as their family.
During the past year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, broke into bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers headed to their houses on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with some savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers at the offices and shops that stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank that is considered a safe haven, which is what most of the rescues on Wall Street are doing.
Ordinary people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the telephone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her executive director, Dick Furd, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they complained about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-one and something in uniform from my block of apartments, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the store.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switching is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim graves desecrated at the time Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, left wing of the far-right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated to the far-right party Vlads Belang, took part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Citys against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signals representing mosques with a red line passing through.
The police are blaming extreme right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend as the political parties on the far right made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in Traun's cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The delinquents sprayed Jewish symbols, like David's Star on some of the graves, but researchers think this may have happened by trying to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was somehow related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of desecration, which came to Muslim religious as the month of Ramadan ended.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that caught almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led an anti-immigrant campaign and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the headkerchiefs and the burkas, and also expressed his opposition to the foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties attempted to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent ' s police issued a ban on travel abroad last Thursday after the magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter ' s previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the trial at the Ashford Magistrate Court in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, in the Judge of the Ashford Magistrates in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad such as France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as he was under the registration of sexual offenders.
He has to inform the authorities if you want to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent's police said they wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible whereabouts of Glitter in the county.
One of Kent's police spokespersons said: "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
One of Kent's police spokespersons said: "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who stays in the UK because here we have systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's inhabitants is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of the sex offenders registered in the county and to minimize any risks that may exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11 years.
When Glitter was released he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrate Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for the possession of images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqueui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to learn that they had forbidden Glitter to travel to France and Spain.
"Get the teacher out of the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no steering wheels, no star costumes.
The essence of the major flamenco teachers, stripped of the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On one side is the artist.
The other one, the person.
Inseparables except in intimacy, at such moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, neglected because they are not going to go out to the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer picks up the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Including in the programming of the month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, more every day", explains the creator, who clarifys that "Flamenco-people" may be any people but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These portrayed people "on the street" are artists able to convey in the scene passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the big flamenco."
With the taste of the "Cante de las Mines" festival Bauer began in 1,997 a long journey to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plaque camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical base of the image, confirming modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dance, song or touch in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essentials, with the duende that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits shown in the sample.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter a moment into their lives, either a long or a short moment.
I think that inside the photograph the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you don't know, or that leave you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Galeria El Fotómata, located on the 20th Street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda of Hercules, where you can visit until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel she writes is "a fear"
It is set in places that do not yet know and deals with unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to moving forward the new project in which she works, a novel that has as protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and went through the Amazon.
He always preferred the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that occupies him today "is a fear" and that "everybody indicates that he shouldn't write" the novel.
"If I were wise, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that he's seen going through the city of the Acueducto for four days to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the highlights of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of "Our mutual friend" by Dickens-, filled the opening of the theatre Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a delivered audience to whom he was made very short the time when Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extrodinary adventure" of the "place to read" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined way" to supplement his "inspiration failure" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and remediating much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are supported.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more inconformable", so he asked the writers to "do not give up frivolity" and "take responsibility" his vocation.
Climatology decreases the Pozoblanco fair which also remains without areas
The feast of areas closing the grant of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the announced arears that the plaza floor was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather conditions have begun with this fair, since two of its three celebrations have finally been unable to be celebrated.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a prison of Castilblanco
So, only Friday was celebrated.
In it, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out shoulder to shoulder, after leaving passages tastefully and aesthetically.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante leaped out his two cooks with greetings and an ear, who gave more the tendons than his tore.
That is, worse still was El Juli, who passed through Los Llanos' body with no pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief spell, the bronze of a large part of the audience was won.

Its load, more than two tons of hash, was not like stopping.
The officers were persecuted and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A.A. J., according to a statement from the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control at N-1, at their passage through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were available to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, sped up, and the control jumped.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later in the archen, when their two occupants rushed to flee the race through a forested area.
The Ertzains finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish that they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hadhish burden, so they moved to police units for a comprehensive inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so a crime of falsification of public documents had also been charged to the arrested.
Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as has been said, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, A. A. J. of 28 years, was transferred to police units to carry out the related proceedings and will be made available to the court in the coming hours.
Stop the actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of some medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking in Montecito, according to the magazine People, a spokesman for the California highway patrol.
The witness has detailed that about 4.30 p.m., Locklear "was fully stepping the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to pull the car out of the car parking forward and backward, and in going back passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently had not initially recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to perform a test for her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to the first-looking officers, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of a substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison over 1900 hours even though he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callazares urges the Andalusian Federation of IU to assume its competences in the case of Silva
The general coordinator of IU and Member of United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, today assured that it will be the regional federation of training which must take a decision on the case of the former Councillor of Youth and Sports of the City Council of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of dealing in favour of family members.
"I am a very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to take over its competences," he said about the action that the party has to take with which so far Councillor at the Seville Consistio.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "IU has always defended that these matters have the highest degree of transparency".
In the same line he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'Sangre de May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós' National Episodes, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish uprising against the French in Sangre de May, which is the most ambitious film in his film with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide list of interpreters.
Blood of May, with a film film exceeding two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in the cinemas, to become a future miniseries for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures that he has fulfilled this film "a dream of childhood", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to film a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, which he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget which has provided the Madrid Community as a whole constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set the atmosphere with the décors and the appropriate clothing the portrait of "an atolondrada Spain that was wrong in mind for which to fight, as the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", has pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a funding like that of Alatrite or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of Sangre de mayo - so he has not been able to film some scenes shown in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the Director of Return to Start, has focused on what is his usual form of work, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and those who don't casting, to appear "humbling" and to consider that "part of the director's office is to go to the theater and to the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters with whom he matches in Sangre de May repeat before his camera, as is the case with Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guilllén Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the Blood of May itself, Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected one, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which must be made known", he assured.
With this film Garci does not expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you conform to making a more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional trajectory.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the sevillana dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillan dancer will honor a sevillan dancer as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women’s liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corse that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dannyy and aesthetic revolution in Europe from between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character and it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of your dances have suggested to me flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in his shows, as he did in the one of "La door open"; and with Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who her student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola older, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have accepted to act in my work and I feel very honored for it."
The assembly also has the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi of Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who makes the role of the eternal companion of these types of artists who were divas in all its extension, and who are always in love with them."
The work also includes in some way the life of this woman who developed in places so far away, especially at the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as across Europe, because she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind you because I think it's those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less puts into value their work," says Bayón.
The show will start today at 20.30 a.m. at the Loupe Theatre in Vega.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Council for Culture of the Board of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" came to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that was held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel Prize and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That light rush", which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the various Andalusian provinces, will be planned to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
Also, the Councillor of Culture of the Andalucian Board has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Newer Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de Malicia", and gives the idea of the disappearance of American cinema, and from all over America, to the striking idea that Newman has gone.
Look what it was like to give them an Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that he knew he was very sick.
Even so, it's been a mess for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid to do the ridiculous or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When it is so hard time and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you remain, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for all a almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight the drugs created in honor of his first child killed by overdose to his brand of home and organic food.
All a gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood barriad admiration without attending nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not a man has died but an age.
Another Englishman, oscarized director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was no less than the summit of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared call Newman his biggest inspiration.
"He has left us the very high list for everyone," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining the requirement of probity and having a serious and remote private life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once, but then he was married 50 years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when he surely had the opportunity not to be.
"But why am I going to eat burger outside the house, if I have a steak?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven, he is proud that his daughters on earth match their fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles that he interpreted, none was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, solicit grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that an Olympics are celebrated in Madrid and, after the 2012 failure, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race was called it, and in my opinion it has been the worst race I've ever been in.
A bunch of disproposals that, of course, if taken into account as an evaluation and I would examine, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
The designs begin with the collection of the backbone, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn't look bad to me, but if they already get you to give it all (including the chip to avoid tails in the race).
Not at all.
Here they only made you go to pick up the backrest (first out of purpose, go for that only) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second out of purpose, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided to buy only small T-shirts with less fabric and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a minute compared to the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the tail on arrival is 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted the wait, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as was expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which joined with conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the cassette.
I think about 500 people are probably going to have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, didn't mark my exit properly.
Of course, if I was asked about the perfect race, this one wouldn't get into my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft receptionist search (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft’s Emerging Technologies conference has shown an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company campus) according to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they wear - and hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the video shows the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
Ask him if he's there to visit someone and tell him he'll take care of him soon.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of your operating system, Windows.
This week we have talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and you won't have so many programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the essential instead of carrying commercial garbage, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
All a finding taking into account that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, as well as software.
When Google Chrome got out on the net, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many pointed out with certainty that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is the necessary layer for Hardware and Software to understand.
It fulfills the same role as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear but one must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
Why are half the applications coming into the system for?
That's less.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and that they are finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post I took it in one of Microsoft's employee rest rooms in Redmond early this month.
In the refreshment machine a poster asks you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not reach the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather by shooting in 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is every day more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio played one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', like Al Pacino in 'El Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the gay muscular parish.
And if we put ourselves to list stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that sharp mustache force that lifted weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it's just the typical male underwear shirt in cotton, strapped and without sleeves.
The 'tank', called the English speaking, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles points out above all others.
First of all, because of his riveting name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport because he receives his name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' points out about the others for his excellent cotton, for his unisex cut, for his distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its top tanks.
It also includes college sweatshirts, back boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor shirts, babes, mini shorts...
Dresses designed for the underwear comfort.
Although it's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They're too fond of it.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry."
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Presently, Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they're much more than some beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion that the company Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish house esponorizes.
Warm and shy, win in short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to introduce the new collection that we have designed my sister Penelope and I for Mango in this new fall-in winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the 50s and 60s film; hence we draw many references.
Then, I like to lose myself in a city and watch women get dressed, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot of it.
Ballerina, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but, in the end, everything unites and has many ties in common.
I liked the clothes from my childhood; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to jump into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
You know that dancers like to do our stylisms for classes and essays, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get dressed is when you actually find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You met not long ago the 30s, did you get into a crisis?
It's okay.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a little girl and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I'm asked by the body and, besides, I want to be a young mother; this I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and bring him up with love.
As for the cinema, you're waiting for several stars you shot last year.
That's right, and I already feel like they see the light.
I, that I'm a woman who comes from the theater, I'm very impatient and restless, all I want for now and of course, it can't be.
I'm looking forward to 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the tomb of Christ'.
To see how they look...
A few days ago, you started a walk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I went up to a walkway to make a model.
He simply called me Naomi Campbell, to whom I've known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial parade for his organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we displayed - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - was going to raise money for this NGO from Naomi.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I who know her, would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm keeping that good part where she's involved.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to do the pine, as well.
For the benefit of women in the third world, what is needed.
Drivers reoccured by alcohol must install the 'alcoholck'
The interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the opening of the drunk vehicle, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual memorandum of the State Attorney General ' s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will have a one-year duration.
Its purpose is to reinstate the driver, so he will also receive a course of reeducation vial.
In the experience, in addition to the Attorney-General's Office of Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation for the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving drunks take the car again.
Alcohol would avoid it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the air spire and prevents the car from being removed if the driver does not blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than the one allowed.
Its cost is higher than 1,000 euros and would run on behalf of the sanctioned person.
In this sense, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce up to 65% of the infringements during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure refers to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing such behaviour before they arise in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial way, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the PSOE in which this system is intended to be installed on school buses, as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the scheduled time in the program, landed in the Hangar president of the airport Benito Juárez de México, DF the Spanish air force plane in which the Princes of Asturias traveled.
The sun was receding but its rays still forced to use the hand in visor mode to see the real couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairway, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier I had asked about the street, the taxi driver, if I knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, so you can't go to the airport to load at that hour... she's from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marine soldiers who interpret the safeguard of honours.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, melancholy, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps told her that in the DF it threatened storm.
They give a smile and a listening stop to the photographers before going to the room where the official debut is waiting.
At the hotel door where you are staying, one of the four majors of the city, a newspaper reporter from Mexican television awaits you.
The best prize equipped with fashion
There is likely to be no place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion prize, which Paris and possibly no live designer more exquisite and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new talents of fashion.
It is awarded a prize of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs at Mango's shop in number 54 of the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried for excitement.
By the way, it is the second largest shop in Europe and it has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one's in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury for the fight, made us end up at a luxury dinner in the opera Garnier de Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the gala presidential table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Nati, with a broken heart of grief and making heart-hungry, for his brother's recent death, set up a suit of the House and some of ELAH's addresses, which cut the breath, and his son Luis's arm - a canyon of nearly two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the chair of his tribute dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and was so gentleman that he ended up, near the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had been lent to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirts - of his own design - and for the dinner turned into a sexy long black dress, got excited when on the evening walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they taught us the ballet rehearsal room and she, recalling other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a large fold hammock.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the walk through the palace's dependencies, but he taught us earlier on his son's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that moved by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously requested, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, here's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And in case it is little, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The awakening almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it's still worse to imagine getting wrapped up in the hustle and bustle of the current life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnection with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book a whole menu of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores of the hand of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Speak Sleeps
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very often, telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk are asleep.
The first time that happens, you get a shock, but it really doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration of the dream that is called dream speakers.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them have been told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur in a very sporadic manner (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once in a week, once in a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They often relate to other sleep disorders as they are usually nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (making themselves sleepy) or sleepy sleepy, but it doesn't have to be that way.
As mentioned earlier, they may also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
Anyway, it's an unstudy phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a tone of quiet voice, loose words, a whisper or anything else (screams, flats, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check whether there is a question that is generating much anxiety and gives him the way out.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it has no treatment, except that it is associated with another alteration of the dream that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress box).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid TV shows or series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children and it costs them a lot to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter dream.
Once the dreams appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should consult or find out what it is that causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most usual), do not fall into the temptation to do an interrogation to elicit information from him.
You won't get anything, because being asleep is not aware of how to organize your thinking.
You will also hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, with which much care in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illaeuern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in his field after a long period of shortage.
Without a good match, the team created many goals and was able to make a goal to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this encounter where the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to rock the squad with a shot of distance, Illhaeusern almost took the "power" and by turn Fonderflick far away, then with Hirn above, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
On the front, we did not let the center camper pass and left only Riahi in attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illousians with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the Illhousien gorge will not be able to taste your happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave your teammates in inferior numericality.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven Illlusians who went a little back to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after an important butterfly, the balloon passed very close to the cross-country.
Sarkozy finds the furious fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will drive for Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hope " to come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general board of the " crisis committee " set up by Breton fishermen to achieve measures to address the increase in oil prices, which marks a record when reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elíso David Martinon's spokesman, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses to be competitive again and to save the conditions of jobs and remuneration of sailors " .
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to slow down the traffic in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused jams of almost 10 km.
The sports port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-Isle have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed on Monday their determination by burning, by scratching the dawn, tyres and wooden pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and of the Mancha, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting of this Wednesday that will take place in the ministry to think of possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move towards Paris " , for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of Lorient's fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached with only one diesel at a price of less than 0,30 euros per litre.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two men and a destiny " has died of cancer, at 83 years of age, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 planes delivered this year despite the threats of recession that it poses in the world economy.
The world's fourth aeronautical builder, Embraer, maintains his forecasts of deliveries for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, reaffirmed Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian builder trusts a lot in the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
IG would like to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group, which has been hit by the US monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the edition of the Sunday of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper needs to be reviewed.
The board of directors of AIG met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which IG intends to separate include its air lease subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 % stake in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No definitive decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly liquidate to repay its loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve granted it at risk of seeing the US authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the appropriate proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives had rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 %, i.e. a loss never seen in the 800-point Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq 9,14 %.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, i.e. the day on which exchanges started again after the terrorist attacks on 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, technologically dominant, declined 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the Standard & Poor's index (extended) 500 by 8,81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the definitive closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save banks that would have allowed some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives denied the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two Republicans out of three rejected their plan.
"That is not a good sign sent to the market, which the Congress sees as unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of the FTN Financial.
"This shows how far the market had this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come "too late".
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the U.S. Central Bank, the Network's N.) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, Head of Economy and Finance of Global Insight.
And further emphasizing the sense of urgency, " every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Mrs. Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by their rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis dramatically accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing "not only a crisis in the United States but a global crisis," added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market went up dramatically.
The yield of the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3,632 % against 3,827 % on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bonus by 4,161 % on Friday, against 4,357 % on the day.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House took place to find out who won between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
No surprise, the Republican and Democrat campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel which has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen considers John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "swimming enough" to allow him to slow down at the polls to five weeks in the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama five points of advantage (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that it was the Democratic who went well.
Among the indecisive voters, who count, Obama won 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them awarded the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of his same candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He's got good instincts, 'but he's got Bill Clinton this weekend.
Septuagenary McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "ingenuity" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge necessary to be president," he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in republican televised advertising.
Obama stressed that it represented the future.
Undisturbed, he was concise and precise.
It enhanced its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he replied, this weekend, a Democrat television advertising that criticized the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans."
" During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, he denounced Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a cold rain.
He did not pronounce the words "medium class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favours Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable person to save the economy that is on the edge of the precipice.
" Next week could be a decisive episode," he said yesterday, the influential and democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama ' s " good economic instincts " with Bill Clinton ' s during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final consequence of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that it would, in spite of everything, reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans in spite of the strikes on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that the realization of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was her first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations from around 2030.
Prudents, both candidates avoided issues relating to the $700 billion financial rescue plan (EUR 470 billion) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents protested last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
Hundreds of Belarusians met on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the polling centres in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: " the dictator, he has to resign " .
Some acknowledge that they have not voted: "Why, because they will do what they want with my vote," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put foreign observers at good hands in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
" We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of the votes," Iouri Potemkine, the spokesperson for the Union of the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroup of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change, Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, for the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, is the executive power.
If some Members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bills. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debts in front of Russia, is in crisis, and if we don't reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
It stresses that participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) favored manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections? Ask the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be at most five Members of the opposition to parliament, who are better suited to power."
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulated on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday his 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Hema-Québec has once again been one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, it regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously wavered by the blood scandal contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the discontent of the public, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, in February 1994, which intended to clarify the circumstances that had led to this tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster could no longer be reproduced.
While Judge Krever was late in presenting his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that had the objective of planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
After making a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public ", he said before proudly saying that at the beginning of 2008, about 94 per cent of the Quebec population had the following confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "trust is extremely fragile."
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended the birth in Europe of many cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
So we support one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious illness can emanate from that, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle that was applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: the nucleid acid tests that enable the donors to directly detect the presence of the virus and not that of anti-virus antibodies, which have been based on the tests used so far.
Tests of nucleid acid allowed shortening the period between the moment the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period in less than a week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed the risk of AIDS being significantly reduced by blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will pass more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV comes through a blood product.
I believe that one can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without concern," says the head of Hema-Québec's management.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the security of our products.
You never know which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It must be constantly vigilant ", Dr. Décary pursues before stressing that in addition to safe supplies, Hema-Québec must also provide for sufficient supplies.
" Needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Since more aggressive cancer treatments often require injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors who regroup on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All people with good health, aged 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria, however, can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 % of the people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory covering the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since present life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood," Francine Décary is distressed.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye balloons and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered to be biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of severe diseases such as leukemia.
" We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the placing on the bank of our thousandth sample of blood from the umbilical cord is expected to take more than a thousand of these a year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of the next year, ", Dr. Décary needs that describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this, since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program at all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact on the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semi-finals of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory for 3-1 (4-3 in short term) at the coast of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-finals series, at the Saputo Stadium.
The centercamper Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time with no goal anywhere, the centercamper David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals occasions.
Roger Levesque was the only one who took Matt Jordan down by the Sounders.
Let us remember that during the first game of the party series to go and around, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take it for 4-3, but the Whitecaps got in the semifinals for 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The third number one of the Canadian is willing to take the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win against the free shots barrier against the Panthers of Florida last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev took a pass in this gain, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave victory by marking the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warn the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the most in the first time, annotated Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest deals with the North
The Prime Minister shall not exclude the launching of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the General Council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Health Minister, Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected during the partial election today.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force remaining on the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric embassies, mining, from Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large as during the electoral period.
The Prime Minister believes that the elections will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a " new economic space " which includes an agreement on labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the recent Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, explained why the North was " a jewel to the immense potential " but did not give a term, amounts of investment, or precise priority in future projects.
What could be more developed above all are: particularly hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, dominated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, five, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamonds " according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France," is our home, is in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us," he insisted, as to show that he was requesting a national founder myth.
Quebec was built very much thanks to its relationship with the North, he underlined: the laughter towards gold in Abibibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having held a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion is presented, I reiterate that position on the part of the government," he said.
In addition, " with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the passage of the northwest, which will be opened every year due to the meltdown of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the Quebec Ungava party), have already begun consultations about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role started some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given ".
Northern development would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded him.
" As the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform the challenges into new times of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to the power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Borassa that made the Bay James our party knew how to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Touching the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric packaging project, Mr. Charest stressed that it is planned for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I expect to be there," he confided to his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stressed that his schedule was still full, particularly because of a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York York Summit.
The General Council of the Week provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec, in particular, calls for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will name members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the great lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had, "we would have made progress today," said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate at Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec's Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the Government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It's Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "Vengeance" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not in any way take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that were brought against him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and leaves a child-soldier to live in inhuman conditions.
The only one who grapples with false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers' Association, particularly, support Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: little cares for a young adult to be psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We still do not realize that, but at this moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when no morals exist: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far minority (what will happen after October 14th?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, the Law, and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what our country's reputation and dignity did.
Mr. Toews the shame is provoked by this resignation and by nothing more.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
On September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J . Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world's largest aural company attempted a defamation process of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution by defamation, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to theirs?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada must spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will soften the opposition as well as scare anyone else to reconsider the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in a number of countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually made by changing ideas and not by beatings.
It was therefore enough for the miner to open her books, her files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects requests and support letters for black Canada authors.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he could ask for a "public" debate by disregarding his views?
According to the vice-president, this word seems to designate only paid lawyers and not all Canadians; it represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and the editors of Noir Canada does it above all because it rejects the brutal way of the miner.
This audience is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but having as a basis civilized changes of arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-threat (following the " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to the authors of Noir Canada urging them to no longer use this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on freedom of university search and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to hold a debate on facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that dislike the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's uncontrolled persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he does not want to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the university world, but also to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months still needs to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, provision is made for: better control by the elected parties of their implementation, of new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the invested public money, of the new provisions to contain the number of houses that are underpaid, as well as a right of control over the wages paid to the leaders of the assisted companies.
The American Secretary of Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
" We make great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on the American daily life will be immense," Republican Judd Gregg said.
The negotiations had been concluded very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would result in a new failure in the mood of investors.
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, which had acceded late to the negotiations, were more favourable to the agreement, but without forgetting to express their discontent of being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly that would enable owners to keep their homes and the salary of the leaders of the State-surviving companies.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
He said that the choice of not doing anything is not acceptable."
The plan of 700 billion aims to buy with the taxpayers' money the dubious debts, assets at risks and inundables from the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a housing bubble that first led to the sinking of mortgage credit risks before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a freeze of liquidity and a ban on banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have been out of stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only secured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of cleaning up the asperencies for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to take up losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would try to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote from Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will get shares in the rescue companies that will divide it in the event of profits and that it will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the embargo procedures concerning housing obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and on cash compensation paid to the leaders of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote of the House of Representatives since today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be adopted.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both by Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber's finance commission, told his constituents that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand " .
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the benefit of taxpayers."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is the cheerleader of a small group in Congress, presented the problems differently, but reached the same conclusion.
" Four hundred professors of economics, among whom three Nobel Prizes, wrote to tell us: We ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention by the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had refused to buy its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) during the U.S. crisis of the U.S. real risk loans.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money, said yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
Instead, we recovered a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that the savers and the families now appreciate that the times are uncertain."
During this time, on the other hand, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffered the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes so long represented his triumph.
The American actor with a lovely smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His smell, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident would also have removed him from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background corridor!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, 83 years old, due to lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the years' time.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he seemed much and who was long regarded as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots one of the glorious faces of American dream will be born.
No ego measured, last brand of quality.
Because in it an entire country in love with the self-made man, the warrior of the Pacific War, injured in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before winning in the theatre, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the driver who ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star also disappear with him, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death provoked the vertigo of the filmmakers this weekend, while his great roles are intertwined on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual change unfolds through it.
Many memories come back to memory like the cowboy with the charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we call on your sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone to the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, a delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Lices Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly mangant in the sumptuous film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar to the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's The Hustler film (1961), will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which he valued in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him above all thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, a hockey team coach on orthodox ice.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a last godfather role of the Irish Mafia on Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the rice was rizo.
Contrary to several movie legends that soon abandoned the career, Newman stayed very much in the world of the cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its facades and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge living in " underplaying " and judging his performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he interpreted less often the role of young galan than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed his true, not-so-known sexual sensibility side.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdoses dedicated his film to Harry and Son in 1984, a work of shame and sadness.
" Among the numerous tributes that took place yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former arms partner Robert Redford (they had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, deeply saddened: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his career as a legend, he is also hiding a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against Hollywood excesses.
We will have seen a lot of his face reigning over vinegar sauce boots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to their Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than content with his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: " Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the race of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
In short, a model citizen.
What do they produce in the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory ?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and its accomplices will be initiated.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing significant damage fraud, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes, often justifying the fulfilment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the town councils - in their entirety about HUF 65 million - stood in part in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of private persons.
The method, which was also made known to researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most bills were false.
To this end, they obtained the Talonars in the Józsefváros District market and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour by the Balaton Superior Region where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose I had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for his consumption, and these served as a model to produce the invoices that were presented among them in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City of Capital.
These invoices were signed mostly by István Lados and his accomplice András, who according to our information rather wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomy center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people do not fit at once in that place.
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt a Harmadik Évesredert - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But great-invented invoice manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed to the food center Pigal Kft. because in the bookshop of it - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppa.
The company's manager, Győző Farkas, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he already knew it was fake documents.
"In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal problems, he did not agree that according to the bill a hundred people were housed, since they have only eleven rooms in which so many people do not have.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has been running for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were not informed either that the travel agency elected in Budapest organizes exclusively trips abroad, so that in the cash bill they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's billing practice.
Moreover - as was known during the investigation - VAT also included in the document, despite the fact that travel outside the European Union was tax free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revefülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the services of the company are not loaded with 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, and the employees of the hotel only extended invoices made to machine, however the invoice was manual.
Moreover, the "signatories" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they placed the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigation of the prosecutorial office - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Equally because of formal differences - inadequate size of the invoice, false seal - it is known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évesredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Szazadi Kulturalis Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfeherto Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to have issued those invoices.
The forgers did not pay attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the Nyíregyháza HIB Kft was in liquidation process, therefore the liquidation process officer - according to our information - refused to have issued such a document.
They consciously issued invoices
Another group of counterfeit invoice manufacturers are those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évesredert.
The manager of Collab Kft. - According to the accusation - he was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictional bills.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices in the current settlement process, the Biogate Kft., which in 2003 supplied invoices for an amount of approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlas Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, with no real economic activity behind it.
There were no capital movements either, for then the invoices were cancelled but they forgot to record in their documents to this entity.
The next group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have any connection to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian Delta Trio SL with a fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to research data, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian, to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also issued company-related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he sent on behalf of the company invoices for the Atlas, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évesredért Alapítvány charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians on express request by Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked due - according to the defendant - to which they received no work.
But he took advantage of these companies, as at the request of his accomplice counsel Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of companies for organizations linked to Zuschlag: for Atlas and for Y-Generáció.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri company to issue fictional invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generátség and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországert presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the competition they obtained HUF 500 thousand respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the competition.
In order for this to be undiscovered, five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Arpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the accused will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor ' s Office - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions have so far not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so until now.
The question is: What interest do you have?, perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - HUF 50 million - the socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days was able to be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he asked for house arrest, but was repeatedly denied to him.
While the many authors of very high-value economic crimes, who never returned the money, pass freely or at least can wait for the sentence in their own home, he has no chance for it.
Psychology of overlaps: Why do we spend more money?
The auction participants are willing to spend more money and overvalue the product.
The neurologists and economists of the University of New York discovered the neurological - economic basis of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in a auction and while under examination through the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (fMRI) the active brain areas of the individuals participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is a fundamental element to bet more than the other, by losing the game, the functioning of the complex called stratum located below the cerebral cortex was intensified.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "auto prize" of the nervous system.
According to scientists, increased betting is explained as a prevention to avoid causing an intense reaction to the stratum.
To support his theory, the economists of the scientific group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups wagered against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members were betted.
Another group in addition to this was promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, the group members lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that the triumph was highlighted for one and for the other the failure.
However, by testing the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "gain" group.
"These results cannot be deducted from any previously existing economic theory.
Those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and risk prevention.
Only the visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation" - established Andrew Schutter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around five hundred million people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infections in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the patients do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are propagated by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. by water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and body moods (sperm, vagina humor, saliva).
It is recommended that travellers be protected by A and B virus vaccine, against C there are no vaccines.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two or three weeks after eating the infected food, manifested by a general poor condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear in the skin and in the white of the eyes jaundice, excrement becomes clear, dark-coloured urine and healing may last even two - three weeks.
Annually, one million people die in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that, according to the calculations, only one in ten patients receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most patients do not know that he is ill because this pathological agent slowly destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical control is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and those who wear tattoos.
Currently, there are about 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
Since this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control too, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if it is discovered in time, it is possible to eradicate the virus from the body, so you can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
On 30 September is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its objective is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less who they believe in God?
According to a recent research, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported the British Telegraph newspaper.
Within the framework of this unique experiment, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists applied electric shock, while everyone was watching a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was found that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the various departments of the University also participate.
The analysis took place as follows; they set a striking instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to set their eyes on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, a work of 17th century Sassoferrato and the Lady of Leonardo da Vinci's armory of the 15th century.
The researchers had the hope that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts while observing the religious theme painting or the other.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they calmed down and in their heart the peace reigned."
Observing the religious theme picture felt 12 percent less pain than when they watched Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so striking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, like by a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality" - added Wright.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown to the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You're what you say about yourself
In his tenth birthday, Google can say: you can find it in people's pocket, as well as in the sky above their heads; you know where they spent their holidays, what doctors they visit and what they care about.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel to the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary in order to achieve the original goals of Google's founders: "We gather all the information in a system of the world!".
According to Google’s leader, the company even after ten years of work that returned to the World is still in the initial phase of the effort to handle all the information.
To the question what is going to happen within five years Schmidt replied this way: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would best suit me?" - However, the software will not be able to answer seemingly so simple questions until there is enough information from users.
Not all netizens are aware that the search keywords, IP addresses and pages are stored accurately during their navigation on the Network.
Thanks, for example, to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can look back at what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if you take advantage of my data against myself, if you collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned by viewing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justified cases also give third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify the paedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who are concerned about people's rights, in May were relieved when the company, together with the EFF, an organization for the defence of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that he was right in his dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google cannot be forced, by any of the points of the constitution to supply any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to obtain its pretext to strengthen the child protection law adopted years ago, about 50 thousand Web addresses and about a thousand wanted phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
So it is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: those who fear to supply their personal data are criticized because they think their privacy, their private lives are damaged when they start using Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "vant-garde incorporation", not so to their rival, the Microsoft, cataloged by his Windows as the conqueror of the World, as much as they both struggle for the same objective.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free software package, constantly updated and looks more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that has just occurred by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional traces behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and as the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers list of their music customs, then they can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, where the most recent photo galleries automatically appear in Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases of those who reveal that for example the bride, by seeing the flow of photographs of the next morning of common friends, she finds herself with whom she spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or they can fire the employee of a company because she writes her sincere opinion on her blog about the company's management: one thing is safe, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person's "on line" life is what she shows herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the behavior of the youth of our day.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least wants to do away with Google's monopoly, can do it (e.g. starting with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but does not leave any trace).
There are many people who don't want to register on collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but they can replace Google's "on line" applications, from text writing software to image and news-reading applications with alternative versions that don't connect with giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day when Google shows its real face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising areas threaten advertising agencies' revenues, while the services that are increasingly introduced cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
However, critical observers will also find the alarming contradictions: for example, the senior management routinely rejected the employee's protest after doubling the price of the company's childcare facility, considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees' food, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement filtered out any information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is ready to function, which if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years will be able to turn to the World: while some believe that Google's draft scan and archive of books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the Supreme Court of the United States, others are afraid of its Health system, because in it we can create our own full health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it can provide a good raw material for writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, a novel of Cory Doctorow's popular, describes in the orwelian form that future, in which a man only Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two underage children helped erase the traces of the author of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
The police questioned two minors about Ozd's double murder, who, according to suspicion, helped to remove the traces of the crime - said the spokesman for the Commissioner General of Public Order in the province of Borsod on Tuesday.
Young people recognized the crime they were charged with, and now they are accused of offenders of the crime.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency, are two girls - can defend themselves freely.
For complicity you can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of Ozd's double murder - a 23-year-old man - has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He was accused of murdering several persons with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he cited his creditor at the headquarters of a company in Ozd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim's nine-year-old daughter.
According to information from the ITT, the young man prepared much earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police analyse with an expert on the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of Prague Stock Exchange shares.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Polish, despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State that within a few months wishes to sell 60 percent of them.
The Czech Economic Journal E15 reported that the Polish supply has been the highest among those offered by interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse were offered so far.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange stated last week that the worst new owner among the stakeholders would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
The experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with an interest of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the ever deeper international financial crisis speak of a "second September 11th".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the President of the United States - opinion La República de Roma - the president has not even been able to obtain the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose objective is to give him a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor" that the multi-millionaire investor Warren Buffett talked about, it's more correct to talk about a "second September 11th."
According to part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the view of El Mundo, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that led the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is growing, and this will affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, following the vote of the Congress there is a danger that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is carried out.
You can't ignore this threat - points to the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw life belts on the tambling financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if as the dominos fall more bank still, then they won't be enough either the new funds, nor the new improvisations.
The long-term need for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalistic selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received only more than EUR 100 billion on Monday - recalls the Vienna Der Standard, adding that there are growing concerns that, as the Americans have done, European taxpayers also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis that passes as a cumin for the Old Continent .
The "saviators" will not have to present immediately hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases are justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid greater harm?
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the beehive
What would be the best way to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the obstacles sensors existing in nature?
For example, that of bees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bees gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of the collision prevention system.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic system of type BR23C automobiles mimicking nature, to which the characteristics of bees were given, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can do away with all collisions.
During the flight each beehorro creates its own ovaled private space that actually looks very similar to our safety protective capsule - explained in the Kazuhiro Doi exhibition, technological director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the eyes composed of bees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
It identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot imitating the movements of the bees, modifies the direction turning to the necessary extent the wheels.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is completely instinctive.
"If not so, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the project of the vehicle robot.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to do away with other bees.
This process must be done in an open and close the eyes.
However, unlike the bees, the movement cannot turn up, down or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the turn direction of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bees to dodge other bees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotating movement and the acceleration besides the braking.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is greater, which means that they have a longer life span than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, much less the storage capacity.
This device in each second must only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
There is no need to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No memory of gigabytes, no megabytes.
This is the first step in developing technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into the models manufactured in series within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to his destination, avoiding the obstacles on his way.
You already have a name for this dear child
The written version of the $700 billion financial ransom package has been prepared to be applied in several phases in order to purchase bad bank credits.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to the Eastern Coast schedule during the new consultations that lasted until mid-Saturday, the congress leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion financial rescue package in total, after several days of discussion, Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, claiming that only formalizing the agreement is necessary in a document.
The commitment on the package was supported by both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, speaking about the result of the commitment stated: this programme will work and be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning it back to the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington schedule (i.e. before the two in the morning of Monday, according to Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the bill called emergency law for economic stabilization in 2008, the first Monday will vote for the North American Congress and then for the Senate.
President George W. Bush consulted with Pelosi on Saturday night and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress achieved at night and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
The programme is different from Bush's original proposal to spend all 700 billion dollars on the purchase of bad credit securities.
Only half of the 700 billion dollars can now be spent, using 250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this amount, the Ministry of Finance will purchase securities of credit, poor rating and the fate of another 100 billion dollars depends on the President's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion may be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and credit-backed securities, as well as other "wine"-type credits as well.
Buying can be done either in auctions or directly - they informed competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which they will pay the companies the amount corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson stated: The law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, deal with the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could result in the collapse of some major financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and expect State aid may have the official limitation of their compensations, which the American argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in some cases will payments be limited, and limitations depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
Limitation means that if the ministry buys under a auction, an extra tax will be imposed for gold parachutes, unless the bank's failed chief retirees.
By directly purchasing bad credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the bosses' compensation is not overstated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that will be in effect a legal limitation for the revenue of the general directors - the Democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress commission, commented on this measure, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the programme, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they will eventually be able to obtain profit from the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and the bank is recovered.
According to the bill in the next five years, the President shall submit to Congress a proposal on how to return taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations about the project.
This is not what American citizens have entrusted to us, that is, they are not protecting the taxpayers' dollars - declared the Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged him to be the same as those responsible for the demolition of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, national industrial selling prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to last month's prices and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007 prices - reported the Central Statistical Office (KSH).
Industrial export prices rose by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.

The domestic sales prices of the processing industry sectors rose at a minimum of 0.1 per cent compared to the month of July.
The higher price increase occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), due primarily to the increase of 4.6 percent per month in bags and belts and the increase of 2.5 per cent in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the production branch prices of chemicals (1.6 percent).
There was a decrease in price in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the processing sectors of wood (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper manufacture, editorials and printing prices did not change.
In the rest of the processing industry, there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent an important weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, first as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from the first of July.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the highest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the food, drink and tobacco industry, of determining weight, there was an increase of 11 per cent.

Will the next year no longer need visas to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities for the U.S.-Hungarian agreement on visa exemption to enter into force on 12 January - the foreign minister spoke of this in Chicago, before the Hungarian residents there.
In his opinion "procticly everything depends on the construction in time on the other side of the Atlantic of the electronic system of access and control."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system, the admission premium will disappear, but tourists will have to register before their departure from the country of origin.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will interview the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing him the Median Cross with the Order of Merit Star of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisors of candidates for the presidency, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama, and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties assured on Sunday their support for the 700 million-dollar banking program of the administration, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and the administration, following several-day marathon negotiations, announced in the early morning of Sunday: a principle agreement was reached on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and defusing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are better able than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, by putting economic issues at the forefront, Obama once again gained some advantage and disappeared McCain's advantage after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy to the vice president.
In a Detroit campaign rally, held last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) the employment, the savings of you, besides whole industries and the stability of the whole economy" - he said to a multitude of 35 thousand people.
He did not take the opportunity to describe McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview given to ABC McCain, he explained that "we will all swallow this up hard (...) but doing nothing simply is not a viable way."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control committee to the fines minister and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, he insisted on it.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, but he consulted with the minister on a daily basis.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that Congressmen would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group they became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel on the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red coalition.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo would have assumed its position.
The Social Christians for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and right now these modern citizens are the ones who give them their back.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the entire Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process was completed that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is still during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the USC in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and settlement of the Germans of the North in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the USC voters.
Modernization also increases possibilities and also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group they became the most conscious, more critical and more stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones who have moved further away from the USC; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have baccalaureate and the graduates.
Thus, less than 40 percent of support for the USC was refused.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
The Conservative newspaper of Vienna: "Who is it with? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved in coalition matters" - it deals with the confusing situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the green ones on the other hand do not yet wish to consult the coalition.
Elections were already held, everything now revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely allowed to see some of their decks.
Werner Faymann, president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman posed the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the ÖVP, in the position of Vice Chancellor.
He stated that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Mosterar reacted cautiously to red offers.
He said that cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere with the ÖVP's internal affairs.
It is still open in the party if they will choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," said Haider.
Jaroka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, and its host is France, who is also President of the European Union this year.
Lívia Járóka, a Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in his message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and it is also the greatest obstacle to the existence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Jóroka - according to the press bureau of Fidesz' group of MEPs in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Gypsies are primarily out of the labour market because of their low level of education.
"Most Gypsies have not finished middle school and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can get university degree."
Jóroka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the European Parliament, there is a need for a broad consensus on these issues, both among Gypsies and among non-Gypsians.
As soon as the school starts, a Roma student will have more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumer taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"The Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must ensure the right to a quality education and ensure the abolition of secret and low-level education," said Lívia Jóroka.
According to the European Parliament, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of school segregation immediately, so it is of fundamental importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and it must be offered to Roma children the possibility of guaranteeing democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Jóroka demanded.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized annually since last year's Berlin meeting, which was held in the sign of the European Year of Equal Opportunities, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision will be taken on the fate of the failure of Doo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the severe electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, for the time being the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so-critical two allowed themselves to be interviewed: they do not cling so much to their posts.
In doing so, they intended to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who one day after the "sunami bávaro" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under Edmund Stoiber's leadership that was at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the blow attested against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopy" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the South province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will certainly have to make coalitions with someone.
As the first sign of the Party's restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Right Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that in the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited for the blow of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly deleted from the stage to the ambitious local politics.
The CSU's top leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition it will also receive an active role Stoiber has been moving ropes in the background, the former provincial government chief and former president of the CSU rated on 28 September as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel herself too.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel could not be a Chancellor unless they were able to highlight the CSU together that played a key role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that he could severely conceal his disappointment from failure, the losses of the CSU will not adversely affect the great Berlin coalition.
What is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured USC and the crisis of the social democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent reached its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
Following the elections on Sunday, there will be no opposition Member in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained with the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexandr Lukashenko, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral result.
Although the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, composed of a hundred and ten deputies, had not opposed more than a decade ago, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time would "allow" the entry of some Members of the opposition into parliament.
Thus the ODSZ eliminated the boycott that originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly increasingly dependent on Russia - which has taken a credit to moderate Russia's increasingly expensive natural gas import and which has contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline passing through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow it to enter Lukashenko and other high-level politicians for having an antidemocratic political regime.
It was a sign of distraction when the OSCE, in evaluating the electoral campaign, placed more emphasis on positive phenomena than on errors - such as the prohibition of participating in a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary Monday report even criticized the campaign itself - in which the opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all this in the view of the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is prepared for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - a month ago which considers the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - said to our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the candidate for the opposition of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime fears allowing the entry of even one opponent into that weightless parliament."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations by seeing the results, but rather tries to get the voters to their message about the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes a lot of problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, local authorities make it difficult for their distribution, but even so I see that it is increasingly the ones supporting the change among older people as well - said Milinkevich, alluding that the Lukashenko regime, which believes its main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate even for retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the decomposition of social security that " looks like the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers opposed the opposition politician described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing other than testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, you'll have more breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the History of Chigi Palace that put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
but since today it starts with this measure against whoever fits and then goes to the bar to have a coffee at work time.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors," says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" the minister needs.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is opened.
This is Reformism," Brunetta said again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, the Secretary General assures: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration on the part of the workers."
Finally, no more breakfast at work hours; no more coffee and medium moons.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7:00 in the morning is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Superior School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences for public employees' diseases have been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people at work in one year".
And he adds that there is a need for more effective public administration
Italian, "which wage dynamics – explains the minister – have been double in the last 8-10 years with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
For now millions of public employees have joined in opposing the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absenteeism of work due to causes of illness – writes the association of consumers – the people of the 'empty workers' is constantly increasing.
It is millions in Italy that employees of the right and productive public administration who have joined together to declare war to the illegitimate norms of the decree."
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of economic treatments from sickness due to service would be answered; the extension of the time zones in which the medical check-up visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions sought by the Minister.
Working accidents, Napolitano: "Crime prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
By 2007, the Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths from homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention at work," says President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalidated by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant association effort to prevent the workplace, protect injured workers, assist the families of the victims and raise public awareness".
"It has been manifested, a 'basta', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by its dimensions, raise the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is the many initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
For its part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini House has emphasized "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes a determined effort on all institutions to put an end to it urgently".
"Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive development, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being equally impressive," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not really want this "tenance to decline" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy exploits.
"We believe that there is still too little going on at the general level to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, at our discretion - it has highlighted Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school ".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - because it concerns communication and awareness of public opinion.
But it is, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in relation to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection envisaged for the victims of work" and the "assistance reduction towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The aim is to restore the worker's insurance guarantee - he has added - because the luck of the person who falls does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator every time."
Low-accused Mp3 readers put the hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a long time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission refers to, which, in a press release in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the high volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable musical devices and high-level mobile phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable manner," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Of scientific evidence – it follows the responsibility of Ue – there emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and provide this public domain information.
We must also review existing systems of control in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have a step forward with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that it causes.
"Scientists - the Executive Ue concludes - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders what possible measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical devices and related devices."
At present, there is a European security standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the auditory damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit a lot of these damage by using solutions such as lower levels and noise exposure time.
In its opinion, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices are heard at high volume (over 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit on maximum noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10 per cent of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives the Commission the way forward for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be held.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Futuit of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission discussed the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the board and the council evaluated analyses and projects, in order to present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bull" of the Municipality and its fellow German Gianni.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all the political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to underline German – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council will be able to come to an end.
There is no remaining position of roles, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – announces the endowment – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work for the future of Rome's capital."
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since their opinions are not binding, German replied: "Everything depends on the work that will be able to carry out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and I am also sure in Rome, your contribution will be essential.
The policy is almost always crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are reflected back again.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
The head of Rome would also like to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless nor a trivial entity: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital expresses".
For German, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking in a united spirit to its future."
A future that, needs the concierge of Rome" would not only be limited to the present communal borders but would look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but also "also considering the role that Rome can and should develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in going by independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and pipe relations (as he does today also gives a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
a Miami lady wrote on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face of stone: he believes he has won the highest position of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!".
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will you be a good president? And besides they're polls; they all say Obama wins and has a good advantage.
Also in this case there is one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in the Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we will know well who will give his vote to the American patriot.
Get one side of the American mentality covered up to the last.
"Say whatever you want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or about McCain."
There are people who swear: If you get to win Obama, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
Despite all these reasonings, however, the winning weapon for democratics is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were Bush's errors during his term of office? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Likewise, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes over George W's position will have an enormous duty to develop.
U.S., economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "kill" for the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interrogated by POW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves to be less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition to the cuts made in the hall where editors work to do the newspaper, it is a great problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the majority of the public understands is not expected to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism predominates today on the American journalist.
Six of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views such as the "kill" of the printed letter.
The "economic impression" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewees have admitted that they are embracing technology in hope "to do something good" by journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is among those who run the newspapers – i.e. the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of national executives are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage is lower than 23 per cent.
For some this has to do with "working safety."
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "get it or leave it".
Directors receive almost always good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are "sick" followed during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: ROMA TRIBUNAL, DANILLO COPLA if it falls into GROTTAFERRATE
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the property instance Danilo Coppola that had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated by bankruptcy in the area of research on the contra- pact relating to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the process of arresting him, last week, he obtained house release, turning him into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate could travel the route of the city of the province to a room of the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence he is accused of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago by the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 million dollar plan of salvation launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the economy.
It gives us a confirmation of yesterday's New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, ever more divided among its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "the Washingtoners" and the world of finance, especially strong in the states of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, that has become a preponderant with the vote of the one speaking at the beginning.
This is just one example of the mutations, the major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not just here.
Whether in the United States or in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to work as a accelerator for incubation phenomena that, with the new climate, are solidified and brought to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-upgradation, the extraordinary re-activation, of the dual status-sovereignity in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance those which have strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of families living in one country and in one state are far more compromised.
It creates an immediate political problem for those who govern it: that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and of those families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or has little to say: the crucial test is the European Union which is always divided between the different interests and the different state strategies does not reach a decision on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, of new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment they arrive at the court it is only the state that possesses economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market will likely and no organization will ever be able to dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance as the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a very related factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of immaterial technology, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will, in turn, have to do more and more with the little things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, look at, can certainly be transported from one place to another on the earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a confined space, a territory.
So who is found as a sovereign, certainly has many more letters about who he is not, and to whom he has the misfortune to live in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second novelty, but I'm looking for a fracture.
He said Territory, State, Government, inevitably speaks Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective consciousness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, of inadequate economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredited, an intolerance, an inappropriate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the Western countries in a growing number.
It seems to progress ever more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far in the air, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the inclusive exception of the term, to have made their own time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a few words, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "resolve" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative departure in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and also capable of the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do).
The impression is that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say no, always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what has been taking shape since now are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and shakes potentially in measles.
In front of all this talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walking on the walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has approached quite a lot.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to paste a body of 100 kilograms over a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The beginning of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a stack of spaguetis" explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the paws of the gecos, covered by microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "takes off the walls easily" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the engineering college at the University of Dayton.
PATH TO PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Layers for walking on the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat and electric conductors.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - Berkeley University, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers like hair that self-cleans themselves from dust during the movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Fats: never with fruit juice
Attention to apple juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, mostly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken simultaneously with some drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packaged as fresh associated with the assumption of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, that since the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society ongoing in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of apple, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Apple juice was already low because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products.
FARMACOS A RIESGOS – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mixture and to pay attention to what is taken in the case of a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active substances inhibited by pommel and other juices.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various agencies of the international and national drug that eventually try to change the information notes of it.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicinal products that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us impress, ask clearly to the doctor or pharmacist» the expert from the Ansa agency stressed.
The Novel of Economy to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of trade and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo who teaches Princeton University and is a well-known editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush administration decisions in terms of economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the attack on 11 September 2001, in those days that Enron broke, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years has been blamed on the economy, but which has now been revealed to be exact.
“I am surprised and a little upset that the memory of the collapse scandal of Enron and Worldcom quickly disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive "very aggressive, particularly critical to the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open-source personal productivity suite that aims to attract ever more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work from volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the less large magazine interface, other more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also to multi-function with the Office 2007, Open Office suite is able to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, useful for e-mailing, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphics processing module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents that accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of modifications, in the drafting of texts, each contributor is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the next few weeks should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English mirror since Friday.
Besides, for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can also send the installation cd to home or to work.
And if the theme of free can be a link to the house diffusion, it is in business that Open Office the test suite, tries the big bet, already able to have several projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And not even the realities that provide an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the well-known Access is the program that allows you to work on the base date; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version is likely to be able to exceed the projected figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the tour of France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third class and winner of the best remeer of the climber.
To give the news is the website of the L'Equipe newspaper.
Kohl, 26 years old is the fourth positive corridor to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl blood champions is among those performed in the last few weeks in the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratory.
If the anti-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place on the Tour and will be angry against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of the positive doping of Kohl to the Third Generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, awarding the bet of the best climber.
INCREASE:NOW YORK TIMES ASKED, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy of emigrant country has recently become only a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is asking in a long article that has devoted to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where they register "more integration and more work" but also the country's highest anti-immigrant feeling and the highest support of the Northern League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation sought by the League also lays the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of the clandestines is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A marked tendency is that by the Pope who by the President of the Republic: "Diorgio Napolitano finding Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to combat racism".
Students of the car rental, up to 900 euros for one room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants' union, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious features to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to sustain – explains the head of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand has completely distorted the market so as to trigger a process of widespread increase to residents."
Apart from the fact that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without the limit of canon, linked sub-rents.
For Sunia, there is a need for extraordinary interventions which, through the review of tax taxation, can regulate prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, there are approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Black Band) at an average value of 800 (Lambate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, 250/280 euros are served by one bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 per individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other universities(Ostiense and Cinematà).
You save only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for one bed and 450 for one single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding area.
In Naples for one bed you are served 300/450 euros, for one room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed you are served 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one person.
in the most girl cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and extra-Communitys is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students over the Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradise cinema, the cities cancel the historic rooms
Historical cinematographic rooms close by favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind city, it's like a face with no eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effectively what is happening in the great Italian urban centers and also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalizing the cinemas, which with the birth of the great methics on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory," it's as if a friend died, a known one with which a piece of place and so much excitement shared," observes the director of the new cinema Paradise, the film that 20 years ago I won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury in Cannes, which counted the poetry of a cinema hall in the province and nostalgia for the way of living the movie that may be lost forever.
The figures given by Anec, the leading trader's association, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and to pay the majority of the rooms in the main cities are over all: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffering from closures are the first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 cinemas less, following by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for his disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, it is the very three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new methic cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romaña.
"The Italian exercise has been developed irrationally" notes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure that those already existing would remain, because when a closed city hall, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the methics.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the previous state debt is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between €16 million and €18 million per year".
Interesting to the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned by the closures, decided to repair itself with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala be in the historical center that on the periphery.
Among the proposed rules are measures of tax facilitation for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators may enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking rates.
"It is an initiative I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting on foot other measures.
It is true, that in contrast to the extra power of the methics, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that was always important to me: the closing of the cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to realize the "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Chirinale of the already closed National Way, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the cartels snowed through the dust, I turn to the other side.”
Link between politics and 'dragheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the elections of the Municipality for the interested in the Pyromalli cosca".
The accusations are heavy that the judges of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria give to the Chief and vice-in-Chief of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by Mafia Association.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted by mob criminal association and compensated 10 million euros.
"Depreciating any legal and moral rule, and of good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to counsel Piromalli.
"The Mafia family - the judges write - would have been allowed to enter officially within the municipality, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrés Regional Board Agazio Loireo does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean'.
The arrested this morning add to those of the past July after the police had announced the cut of heads of the Mafia family Piromalli.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the head of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballotage in May 2006, had been elected as head of a right centre coalition.
I'm going through a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call into question the deputy minister of the interior who was at that time Marco Minniti, accusing him of organizing everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to request the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental intercepts made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the willingness to favour the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the public administration's elections on the interests of the Mafia families."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones go down to the stage
It is an extermination that occupies more than 70% of the surface of the planet and are now discovering it, the great global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they look at big ones like Chevron.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, investigations have intensified.
When the price of low oil in 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the wave movement of the sea.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power stations.
And there would be currents and tides.
Giants at the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, who in 2005 sealed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and more among these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technology on ocean energy," stated the spokesman of a company associated with ha to the U.S. oil colloquium at the Wall Street Journal, and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is on obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a very important signal, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drillings.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to follow the path of the energy that comes from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicates an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts like those Portuguese or Scottish are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce long-scale energy, technology must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good links between them.
The force of the waves, which makes the boas move upwards and downwards becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
Pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through underwater cables.
For now there are four implants of this type in the process of development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping center and a parking lot, using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there is tides, makes the turbine pallets rotate, creating a rotating movement that nourishes the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers waiting for the authorisations necessary to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Power, now deserves the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and an investment of 35 million is planned for 2009.
