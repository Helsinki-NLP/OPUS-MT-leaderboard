Members of the Galile Nation National Assembly are concerned that they may appear to be "broad"
Many members of the Galile National Assembly are upset because they have been suggested to change their title, which is to be called MWP (members of the Wales Parliament).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Galile Nation Assembly is concerned that “it sends with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers from outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Wales Party of the National Assembly of Wales said that the group "is not pleased" as a whole and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative member said the group had an "open" attitude to the name change, but he also observed that "MWP" is similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation for the introduction of the name change, said: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on even those members.”
The Law of 2017 on the Government of Wales gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which have revealed that many of them want to use the "Gallor's Parliament".
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly in Wales, the Commission preferred “Members of the Parliament of Wales” or “WMP”, but the option “MWP” received the most votes in public consultation.
It seems that the members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach consensus could result in Elin Jones' head beating, the chairman of the steering committee, who is expected to send the draft law on changes over a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including the rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the last word on their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians shall vote for the referendum on the name change of the country
On this Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their view of changing their country's name in the "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was organised to resolve an old dispute with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim on its territory and repeatedly opposed Macedonia 's accession to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposer of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not consider this vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is only a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bishops' Clopots have stopped fighting as a result of the problems faced by the churches in Harlem
"Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that you had previously found a bar and a church in every corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today, there are no bars and no churches."
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are otherwise socializing today," he said.
"Bars no longer have the day-to-day role for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather."
And as far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that money from the sale of goods will be spent faster than leaders expect and that, " sooner or later, the disintegration will be the same."
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “so this will speed up the closure of churches, because it is unlikely that many of the people who move to these buildings will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations made up of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African-American people, who carried out their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a congregation of Afro-Americans, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, which opposed the commitment or promotion of African-Americans.
A fire that took place in 1939 had greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's enorious plans were made to rebuild it and included the carillon in them.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, called the "serious people'sclothes".
The expert who put the trolley into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument of unchangeableness".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said that he was the world's first Carlon in the world by an African-American musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a bigger Carlon, to Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What was heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought along by the deacons of the church, others by episcopal diocese.
The church, the parish governing entity, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the church, even if it was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the enoriacs complained about the lack of transparency that has given evidence of the diocese.
A shark hit a 13-year-old kid trying to catch lobsters in California
According to the authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy, while he swims, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the homar season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near the beach Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the KSWB-TV post in San Diego that he swims about half an hour with his friends, in the morning of Saturday, when he heard a little boy screaming for help and then moved with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel also said that at first he thought the boy was thrilled to catch a lobster, but then he realized that he shouted “He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole clavicle was torn apart, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I cried out to all those who were in the water, and I told them to come out of the water, 'There is a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The shark species is not known to be responsible for the attack.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that is a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
The authorities restricted access from the Ponto beach from Casablad to Swami from Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury plans to strengthen his position on the market for beauty and fashion products in Britain
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, making available radiations with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a consolidation of position in the UK market for beauty products, worth 2.8 billion pounds, which continue to grow, although sales of household products and fashion are not to a degree, the larger rays with spice products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several stores in the next year, if they prove to be a success.
Investment in beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Retirement Retirement Retirement Retirement Retirementers have stated that the number of beauty products they offer will be doubled, up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaunchs its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, a growing demand among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two shops of the Sainsbury chain for testing purposes, the first being the open last week in Croydon, in the southern part of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of the Sainsbury relay, said the outlets will increasingly look like universal stores, because supermarket chains are trying to deal with the big retail stores, Aldi and Lidl, which provide more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included products from August Argos in hundreds of shops, as well as Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means that it has recorded increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The prior attempt of the supermarket to restore its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ceased after a disagreement on how to share Boots' sales in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business including 281 stores, Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds, three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of the Sainsbury retailer, said: “I have transformed the appearance of our radios with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to give you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations transform us into an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way to make purchases."
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract
The "Dragons' Den" TV Protagonist Peter Jones is furious after TV presentation Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The company of the couple was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Ptroew.
Presentation of the 37-year-old "This Morning" show announced to Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby generated Peter Jones' anger, the protagonist of the "Dragons' Den" show, ultimately withdrawing from their business that offers lifestyle services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most beloved people on television admitted on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, no longer allow him to devote himself to their trade marks, Truly, which includes access and household items.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptroew and almost doubled Willoughby's fortune, with an estimated £11 million worth of pounds.
After the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would abandon the Truly contract, Jones left the United Kingdom to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
The statement of one source: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw has shocked everyone.
No one would ever believe what happened on Tuesday, but it was a little before the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the presentation of the "This Morning" issue, which is among the best sellers in Britain, could bring to the company the damage of millions, as a result of investments in such products as pillows and candles, clothing objects and household items, as well as possible additional delay of launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years of age, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's actions.
Willoughby will become the M&S trade mark ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host to the ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A nearby source of Jones said last night: “We do not want to comment on his business.”
I was very tough, and then "we fell in love"
He made jokes about the critics he will receive from journalists for making a comment that some would consider to be “unpresidential” and that he has such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
He said Trump mimicking a voice of "news presenter".
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as an enormous step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have ceased.
Over three months after the June Singapore summit, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world's leaders on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "appropriate response" from the United States regarding the earlier disarmament marches of North Korea.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"Everything goes well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending missile tests, supporting the liberation of hostages and returning American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act like a president, but if I were to behave in this way, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who are trying to enter this incapacitated arena, would be about 200 people,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help is not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of the Lombok island has been dislocated, no national disaster has been declared, a necessary condition for the launch of aid actions at international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the foundation "Save the Children" is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known if foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesperson of the Agency for National Disasters, said the Indonesian authorities assess the situation in the Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
In view of the earthquakes sustained by Indonesia, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be sufficiently prepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh , they are not often found on other coasts .
It seems that the lack of a warning siren in the case of a tsunami in the Pole, although a warning has been issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best circumstances, the journey between islands in Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters also complicate this.
A hospital ship that settled in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that the improvement of Indonesia's precarious infrastructure be the central point of his electoral campaign and made urgent allocation of money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will take part in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from Hindu sectarians, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands moved out of their homes, as the Christian and Muslim gangs broke down on the streets, using macettes, arches and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge de la Liverpool gives the saviour goal and match the score in the game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of the Chelsea team, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge took a step from Xherdan Shaqiri, while it was about 30 meters away from the other team gate, and his team was driven by Chelsea by 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a whistle in the direction of the gates.
The ball reached above the one, heading towards the corner of the right at the top of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed by Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped to her and fell into the gate.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to move forward as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge said for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think very much about it, I just took the ball further."
Chelsea drove 1-0 to the break after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned to the middle of the land and ran to half the land of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick move of one-two in the middle of the field.
Then sent the ball to Hazard, who entered the path.
Hazard oversaw the defense and sent the ball into the net, succeeding in hitting it with his left leg and passing by the player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Naples team at the League of Champions on Wednesday, at 15:00 on Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the Videoton team in UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped under the ruins of the buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and that triggered waves up to 6 meters, the Agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000 people, has been covered by the remains caused by the collapse of the buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of killing a woman through the stab
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street and arrested a man suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen something about this subject to come to the section for statements.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in the early stage, but I appeal to all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any material useful with the help of the on-board room to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belongs to a woman in Birkenhead and that it was found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people came to the crime scene who think I know the woman to ask questions about the place she was found in the morning.
The investigations are under way, and the police said they're trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but he was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few hours until they were allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that now the entire area is considered the crime scene.
On the spot, there was a woman in tears.
"It's so awful!"
At 14:00, two dubs of the police were in the perimeter and one more was outside it.
A few police officers stood in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Any person with information is requested to send a message directly to @MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously at phone number 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by the "history's record" exchanges
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell's society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "insanity" and "a attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate on the removal of states as the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Westminster Palace to become a target.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe a wrong Cromwell would sacrifice himself for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and a part of the history of a figure that many believe deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether it's an accurate representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
But surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, which is a part of this division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve celebrated and celebrated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a Southwestern China market, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only after the name ‘Yuan’ was found dead after he had been sectioned an artery and was covered with blood, near a pig farm in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editorial of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he came with his cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighboring kennel was open.
He said that in the elbow there was a pig with big blood in his mouth.
Legal doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were full of blood and finished," said the cousin, whose last name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed their pigs.
After about an hour, his body was found.
The animal that caused the death of man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was closed to stop him from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and authorities negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs that attacked people have also been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and their husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a pig of 300 kg, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and chase the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that blood taste can trigger such reactions."
"They just play.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect," he said.
Uragan Rosa, who has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves to cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States in the next days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a hurricane of category 1, Sunday, from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it began to form a depressive area across the Pacific Ocean and moves east, to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula, Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, he will begin to push intense tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity that will interact with the depression will generate abundant rains in the southwest in the next days.
Local rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause rapid dangerous floods, waste streams and possibly desert landslides.
Intense tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevade and Arizona.
Precipitation between 5 and 10 cm is expected in the south-west, especially in the majority of Arizone.
Rapid floods may occur due to rapid deterioration conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rain could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into gusts and dust.
The nearby depression area will bring torrential rains to the areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of nearly 2 cm is possible, which could lead to minor flows of waste and slippery roads.
These will be the first precipitation in the region, in the wet season.
Sprinkled tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and in the first part of Monday, before the rain spreads more Monday evening and Tuesday.
The intense precipitation will spread to the so-called "four corners" Tuesday and persist until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense changes of temperature in the U.S., as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic short-distance temperature changes.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences in the central area of the U.S. are encountered.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Within the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to form and expand again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern area of the United States will face a hot start in October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the south to certain northern portions.
Tuesday, the city of New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high temperatures over average for the East of the United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people followed the press statement supported by the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a last hour news: an agreement concluded between Senator Jeff Flake of the Arizona for the FBI to conduct an indictment investigation for a week.
Ford told the judge that he is 100% sure that Kavanaugh harassed her while she was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said it was 100% certain that this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have followed the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average vision on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not available immediately for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems in identifying people watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
ABC was in second place, with a number of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after hearing.
Flake was at the center of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while the protestors shouted at him and he was trying to get up in an elevator at a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He looked down for a few minutes while people were fighting him, and everything was live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
“Do you think he tells us the truth?
He was told, “Be strong, while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
The televisions then broadcast live the vote on the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he would do this only if the FBI agreed to examine the charges against the nominationist next week, which was demanded by minority Democrats.
Flake was mostly convinced of talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's election was an important one, since the Republicans obviously would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses of criticism of "political games" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Great Britain and to undermine national interests in an interview for the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Great Britain, participated in the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the one accompanied by his photograph on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect their reciprocal tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of having shot the LSU player dead.
Police arrested a suspect in the case of the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, the basketball player at LSU, 20 years old.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with murder of grade 2, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, affiliated CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say that he admitted that he shot Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Legal Medical Office published a preliminary report on Friday, saying that death was caused by a head shot through the neck.
The Department deserves the police force Louisiana, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of that area for the aid offered in the investigation, which led to the arrest.
Athletic Director LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "dignity and the search for justice."
Sims was 20.
The attacker with a height of 1.98 m grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he scored, on average, 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoverys.
Friday morning, coach of LSU basketball team, Will Wade, said the team is "damaged" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw a column of ashes over the city of Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the south quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after their activity in craters began and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several hurries and vibrations.
The images on the social networks presented thin layers of ashes on the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in the activity of the volcano that is 72 km south-east of the capital, after an earthquake with magnitude of 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Dispute between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence protestors battled with the gendarmii, on the first anniversary of the Catalan secession vote, gathering thousands of opponents.
A group of masked pro-separatists held away from the gendarmes bombarded them with rotten eggs and paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The harassment intensified later, using its poles to control the situation.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups scanned "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while the Union protestors shouted "Long live Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during protests, according to the local press.
Tension remains at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose, in a large majority, to become independent, although participation in the vote was low, and those against the secession boycotted largely the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at the polling centres in the region, during violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped over Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narciss Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“ Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I watched my parents cry for joy that I can vote, but now we don't have anything else to do," he said.
Despite the achievement of a vital but narrow victory in the December, last year's regional elections, Catalan pro-independant parties tried to maintain the advance this year, many of the best known leaders either in exile or in detention, awaiting the trial for the role of organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone the protest in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation becomes increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would be candidates for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Many men were arrested after entering a house with their car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on Thursday, about 7:30 p.m. in the Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage to the gates and even the building was caused.
It seems that at some point an alibi was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped Livingston team win with 1-0 in front of Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unrepeated, Steven Gerrard reaching the second defeat in 18 matches, as manager of the Hebox club.
Dolly Menga's hit turned out to be different while Gary Holt's team played the same level as Hibernian in the second round.
Gerard's team remains without a victory in the Premier League in this season and faces the Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to this, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston continues undefeated in division until six matches, Holt's main coach still feels the taste of defeat because he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against raw visitors
Holt's team should have moved forward long before they signed up, and their orientation caused all kinds of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through and tried to shake the space at the gates, then Alan Lithgow managed to shake wide after he slipped in and intercepted the ball sent by Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause visitor problems at the free strikes.
And that was how the crucial gap came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston managed an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to pay attention to Menga, who listened and scored from the center of the horse.
At that stage, Rangers dominated his possession, but he faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and the carrier Liam Kelly was no longer greatly disturbed by the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second round, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't succeed against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgow hit a lot from another Livingston team player.
The diagonal steps continued to come into the seat of the Livingston team, but without success, and the two requests for penalties - after Halkett abruptly shot Glenn Middleton and after a hen - were not accepted.
"Fenomale game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on stadium Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward path.
Their game style and team have not changed since the top comeback, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he trained his team since taking it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the entire game.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they've had good performances since they're driven by Gerrard, they haven't reached the same standards.
The empty passes were unsuccessful, they managed only once to catch the gate of the free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Joint reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Köln
It was all pink on Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin to have breakfast.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany to remedy relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied because of problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Köln to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
The police have invoked security grounds to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but quite a lot of supporters have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, the majority of Kurds, made their voice heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it with open arms in the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division with regard to a visitor considered a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies after collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast town, around 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics appeared at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the spot.
The accident takes place just a few months after another biker died following an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the spot, which is about a mile away from the place where the accident of Saturday happened.
Metropolitan police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, bus routes are diverted, and motorcycles are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured following a fight
Six prison officers were injured following a high-security prison for men, a prison representative said.
On Sunday, there was a fight at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30, this is under way.
Specialized officers have been brought to deal with the fighting, in which eight prisoners are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers have been treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “The assistance of the prison’s specialist personnel has been requested to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer time after the graces."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last year, in October, the disturbing officers were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the personnel being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded because of the Rosa hurricane (dry zones can enjoy benefits as a result of this)
There is rarely a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the south-west desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western area of Arizone, south and east of Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of the month will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service announced in a message on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones maintained a storm or tropical depression over a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix in 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an action hurricane about 60 km away from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Urbane forecast precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including in the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, there will be recorded quantities between 3 and 5 cm, with total possible quantities up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid floods, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in some areas the torrential rain will be beneficial, as the south-west faces drought problems.
According to the United States Secate Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is faced with at least one severe drought, the second largest category, which is found onweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides in the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still having hurricane power in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high flood risk.
"The torrential rains are expected between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and can also reach 25 cm", according toweather.com.
Then Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger represented by Rosa or his remains is the extreme torrential rain in Baja California, north-western Sonora and the desert in the south-west of the United States," said a representative of the National Centre for Urbane.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring waste streams to waste, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsome Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old person was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he was in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The officers requested the help of citizens who could have materials on their mobile phone, and also to appear at the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party's "discouragement and anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump further stated that Kavanaugh faced "discouragement and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified to Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's assertions regarding the fact that he had harassed her sexually ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on her assertion.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw on that day Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage."
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best legal minds of this generation," he said to many supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of the republican presence in the interim elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but in a way, I'm running," he said.
“For this reason, I express my positive view of the candidates I consider great.”
Trump claimed that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination will take place on Friday, a GOP assistant for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and a tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves with a six-metre height hit the beach in the murky, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their way.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, thus becoming victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson of the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami brought cars, cattle, houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled widely at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to climb the trees to escape the tsunami and survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency present several destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the appeals continued to shake the town on the coast.
The earthquake series has been felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Indonesia said that the energy emitted by the powerful earthquake on Friday was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb from Hiroshima in World War II.
Perhaps the geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow golf course, intensified the size of the tsunami, added the representative.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing persons.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be higher along the 300 km coast north of Palu, an area called Dogalea, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely disturbed, without any information" in Dogalga, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
On Saturday, the Agency was severely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had reached the time of the warning.
In posts on social networks, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
In a few minutes, a water wall hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the truth of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major disruption of electricity, which blocked communications in the Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The army began sending freight planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuated people still need food and other basic things.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the Indonesian tsunami goes from 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While the Dogalga Word Vision staff arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees are trapped in improvised shelters in the office yard, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Although aid groups have begun to increase aid actions in the event of disaster, some have complained that comprehensive foreign workers have been prevented from travelling to the Palu.
According to the regulations in Indonesia, financial resources, materials and personnel can reach the place of production of a disaster only if declared as a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia, said.
“After what the government will say, “Yes, this is a national disaster,” we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has yet been announced.”
After the second night of the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday in Palu, the friends and families of the missing hoped that the loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescue personnel released a woman who had been under the ruins of two days with her mother's body next to it.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other people in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandage, were his students.
"In view of the experience in the field of parachute, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after broadcasting news on the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the community of sports enthusiasts, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But on the right of his messages there was only a gray bee, and not two blue bees.
"I think that means the messages weren't transmitted," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding a Newport ATM on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole the sum of $26,750 from a Brink employee who feeds a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied a ATM from the entertainment complex and prepared to transport more money, wrote Dennis McCarthy in communication.
While he was busy, another man “escapeed behind Brink's employee ” and stole a bag of money that had to be transported.
According to the notice, the witnesses observed several suspects who fled from the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport police at phone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye".
It made the announcement on Saturday about Twitter change: "the person who is known officially as Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before its appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where they expect to launch their new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled "in reasons of emotional nature", mentioned the producer of the show.
In addition to being a abbreviation for the current name of the scene, West previously said that this word also has a religious significance for it.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly known word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year, in the conversation about the title of the Big Boy Radio Host album.
“So it’s you, it’s me, it’s about us.
It all started from "Kanye", which means the only one, and it came to "Ye" as a reflection of our good, evil, and oblivion and of the whole.
The album is more a reflection of what we are as people."
He is one of many rappers who have chosen to change their stage name.
Sean Combs had numerous stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has changed his name, sometimes with chromium, sometimes without, and also with high letters.
President of Mexico promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, as the country near the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to punish the Mexican people".
The troops fired at a peaceful market demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left-wing movements of the students were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for AI
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and the user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after more members of the U.S. government have made announcements about AI, even if an official strategy for artificial intelligence is missing in the US.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be first in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
"The twinning of the IA research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next AI discovery," Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances that the next major achievement in the IA field would be made in the U.S., Lee said for CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers IA: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the leading companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that defeated American player Othello, the best in the field at the time, and later he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated the earlier competitions of American governments in the field of technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency's advanced defence research projects, and asked when to be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
"Not China is driving academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired remarkable graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to intensify its efforts by AI.
"I think you should automatically offer a doctor's visa in AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generations of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States set up a Joint Center for Art Intelligence to involve partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the American Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
Also at this time, NSF invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, no changes have occurred in the legislation of the United States which aimed at setting up a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote on the referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wanted the country's name to be changed to the "North Macedonia Republic", a change that would resolve an old dispute with Greece for a decade, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June with regard to the new proposed name, but the opposing nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign was doubtful as to the presence at the vote, and it may not reach the minimum limit of 50% required for the validation of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: "Do you agree with the EU and NATO accession, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from Yugoslavia's disengagement, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia will live free under the shadow of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, quite many members of parliament said they would respect the result of the vote in order to make it decisive.
In order for the name to be changed, a quorum of two thirds is required in parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the people with voting rights were put to the vote.
"I came to the vote for my children and our place in Europe," Gjose Tanevski, 62, said a voter from Skopje, the capital of the country.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change of Macedonian name, which will allow them to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov prepared a scene of small sizes and set chairs in front of high courts of those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the top, not the back door," Kavarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can move to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO will bring such much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has a 20% higher unemployment rate.
"I think most of them will be in favour of changing their name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that a result in favour of changing the name would be “confirming our future”.
According to a poll published last month by the Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
For the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-vestic government policy since the government took over last May.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to cross the entire Brighton team defense and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass the Brighton team's defense and won the Manchester City team's 2-0 victory Saturday on the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed like Aguero was incredibly easy to mark in minute 65.
The Argentine attacker took a step in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among three defensive players from Brighton, before he got to the free side of the land.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four opposing team players.
He managed to get past a defender, and then he went over more heavy players at the edge of Brighton's team.
After that, he took a step to the left, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English attacker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, able to avoid the porter at Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a whistle to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero is facing a few foot problems," Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City, told reporters.
"I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he signed up an empty at that time."
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial advantage for the Azuls in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep step on the Brighton team's territory at that stage.
Then he took a step on Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane pulled the balloon a few times until she sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the gates.
The Azura attacker hit the balloon to the net right before he headed out of the field.
Manchester City will meet at 12:55 a.m. with Hoffenheim in the group phase on Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to hurt the game against Rockies
With the national team removed from the competition in play-off, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win on Sunday in the game against Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still play-off implications for Rockies, which hold an advantage with a game front to Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies got at least one unpredictable place, with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep their first title division.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here, in Denver, alongside crowds, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but, according to sources, is inclined to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening shot of the match with number 34, had a heating session on Thursday and would throw in normal conditions on this Sunday.
The middleman in Washington has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 at 220 and 2/3 at this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation of making a decision by the Supreme Court as regards Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the republican presence in the interim elections.
“All our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, I don't run, but I actually run, so I try out of power to support good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “See this terrible, radical group of Democrats, see what happens right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we won't give it."
He also said that Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see that in the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "wrong and evil, naughty and lying."
He referred to the Senate's Senate of Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and which was a member of the Senate's Judiciary, which was strongly oppressed by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you disclose the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different point of view.
Persons expressing their opinion are no longer tolerated
I was not surprised at the fact that the Momentum activists of my local party supported the motion of censure with regard to me.
After all, I'm just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who were told they weren't welcome, just because we expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment because she was vehement in anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the motion of censure was critical to my address because I disagreed with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, on which neither Jeremy had the common views of the former leaders.
The Communication for the Nottingham East Friday session of the Labour Party noted that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the eight-year term as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been so.
Unfortunately, many meetings do not take place in this way today, and the promise of a "better, more gentle" political environment has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party's leadership.
Things began to be like this when Jeremy became the leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom we had a common vision of politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree with some things I would not have agreed with, including national security or the single EU market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuses on the dissociation networks that demand my elimination from the party, exposing the central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know I'm luckier than my colleagues, because the comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face an abuse of a sexual or racist nature, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different points of view within the party, and with each motion of censorship or change of the rules of selection, the party becomes less and less flexible in this respect.
Many people have advised me over the past two years to put my head down, not to be so vocal anymore, and everything will be "good" like that.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was high, motivated by the negligence that the government of Thatcher has proved to have gone to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who have the greatest need of them, as local advisor or minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including at the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues that I do not agree with in relation to the current leadership are unclear.
People who have supported Friday's motion can only tell them that, in the context where the country is headed to Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat to the elimination of the party or political opportunism will stop me from taking the decisions I consider in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team arrives in top rankings
Despite the fact that two late trials have somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's extremely interactive game of Tennent's Premiership.
It's now in the top of the ranking, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
Eventually, everything was summed up in their best defense, as well as the fact that they took more of the chances, which helped the host team and thanked Coach Peter Murchie.
“We have been subjected to several tests during our games so far and we continue to be unbeatable, so I must be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie de la Melrose said: “Merits are given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of more chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, granted him an advantage to the Ayr team, but a yellow card received by Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who could join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformatted attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even at the middle of the game, managed to sign up, and then managed to transform an individual attempt, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second round very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the march to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes because of Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, which was pulled out of the field with targa, and after the game was resumed, Ayr disbanded through the attempt of the Stafford McDowall player, transformed by Climo.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the spare player pay for an untransformatted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a severe pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for plating Climo without ball, MacPherson managed to march, offering him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo turned the attempt, as he did again near the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" movement and sent extreme Gregor Henry into the deep for the fifth attempt of the host team.
Sitcom Vedeta "Stil Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of "Stil Game", seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after finding out he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis's role in the BBC's beloved show, writing his script and playing alongside his long-standing partner, the comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the nine series, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman plans his life after Craigang.
According to information from the official register, this is the director of the Adriftmorn Limited company.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to become involved in "the restaurant development industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia island hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings hang the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by the motto: "The sea is ours in law.
We need to get her back."
Throughout Bolivia, which does not come out at sea, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of the resources of the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely to be at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary forward, a spirit of unity and sensibility and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of strong discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of sovereign release to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – facing a controversial battle for the re-election of the next year – also has much to gain from the decision of months .
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that too few things would change if it happened.
The United Nations body within the Netherlands does not have the power to grant territory belonging to Chile and has concluded that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that this case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
And not only that Bolivia has not been successful in cause, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea was diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss it afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia at the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually unusual quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance of "put an end to 139 years of mutual disagreements," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past.”
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday, at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to abide by the promises made during a summit in Singapore with the leaders of the rivals.
His comments come in the context that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume diplomatic actions on nuclear threat after more than three months after the meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it is an "unreal view" as the continued sanctions and the United States' objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean war to ever make territory in the north give in.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement without first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers to be the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second summit Kim-Trump.
A fashion presentation in Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will soon be available in stores
If you're looking for hats to extend your collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
Far from practical hats have conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion makers have sent the creations that steal eyes on the podium.
The piece of resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant hat, bej-colored, with a broad bud, similar to a penis, in which the heads of the models were sunk.
Other oversized accessories have included pens equipped with the margins, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head against the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had stitched lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not fashion high sewing.
One of the creatures seemed to be a diving equipment, having a oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be an ice-cold cone.
And if you want to keep adopting such a dress style, with oversized clothing articles, you're lucky.
The stilists predict a comeback of huge bonnets in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hair comes after the appearance of the hat "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide butter, seen to everyone, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the somewhat practical hat that appeared on all social networks has caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, respectively, of people of straw for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the bathing suit that wears it.
The orange bag of rafia, with rafia fringes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of the spring-summer 2019 "La Riviera" collection of Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week
Stylist Luke Armitage said for FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing hats and oversized beach folk in luxury stores in the next summer, because the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record on academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results for examinations, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), work to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for higher and high school education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words come to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained a Higher grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools have shown that 72% of students have obtained a Higher grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish have obtained such a certificate.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as matter, are held as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and other areas.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for the reasons that employers had given them to fight for vacancies, 17% had been attributed a lack of language skills.
More and more, therefore, language skills become imperative for preparing young people for their future career.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to carry a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, 15%.
Investment in foreign language learning is therefore important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will have greater opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with teaching frameworks that are specialized in this field.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills needed to succeed, however the future would be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It must be done well.

LeBron will be debuting at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is almost the end for fans who want to see LeBron James as he debuts for Los Angeles Lakers.
The Coach of Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in opening the Sunday press against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play still to settle down.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James would probably play limited minutes.
Following the training since the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game Lakers programme in the press.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need games in the press to prepare myself,” he said.
Trump's election rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins this evening a series of campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump's matches scheduled next week, which include stops in places where the electorate is favorable to them, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for the candidate elected by him for the free place of the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wishes to strengthen support for future elections in the middle of the term, as Republicans risk losing control over Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election rally take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I track him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00, East Coast time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can track Trump's election rally online in West Virginia via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss this week's hearing by Brett Kavanaugh, candidate at the Supreme Court, hearings that have become tense due to allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, so the FBI will investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of riots is to help the republicans, who are facing tough elections in November, to gain some land.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign stated that the role of these five weekly matches is “energizing volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so important for its program that the president will travel in as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season,” Reuters said a spokesman for Trump’s campaign, who did not want to be named.
Scheduled to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented on the media in Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won the elections at a difference greater than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is led into the polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a politologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder 2018 Cup: U.S. team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to maintain the chance for simple samples starting on Sunday
After three clear-dominated sessions, it's possible that Saturday afternoon foursomes was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is an invented concept for the sports world, but players even believe in it, even more in the case of such competitions.
So, where is their motivation now?
"They were driving us six points, now the difference is only four points, so we rely on this decrease for a little motivation," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, when there are another twelve points in the game.
Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game begins to change in their favor and that there are enough reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won every three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with a lethal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those chimes of celebration have become increasingly noisy as the run progressed, especially when it entered a crucial point by which it brought the score back to equality in the fourth game, after he and Thomas had been driven by two points after the first two holes.
The hit that won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to focus and worry about your own game," says Spieth.
That's all these players left.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe won four out of four games and it seems I can't fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't need any additional hit on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is also valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the new Friday mornings.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would eventually lead to a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun will hang over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time, in different holes.
Discussions on the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson passed quickly by Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs test, when he made a pair of Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles at the first nine holes plunged the Spanish and Swedish into a pit so deep that they weren't even close to coming out of it.
Sunday, though, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and ants are fascinating and deserve to be followed by the interactions between pairs, the advice given and the way in which a strategy can be modified on site.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US team has the motivation to continue fighting, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after it has finished the fourballs and Saturday ants with a 10-6 advantage in front of the United States.
Inspired by the pair made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two wins in front of an exciting Tiger Woods, which has increased their score from so far to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to regain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes at the fourballs test in the morning and won the series with score 3 to 1.
The U.S. has opposed a more serious resistance to the antsom test, where it won two games, but it has not been able to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 simple Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in line, and together with Molinari, a pair called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair that wins four points of the four opening games throughout the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they supported themselves in a superb way to defeat the disheartening Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambbe with a score even clearer, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two games on Saturday, had occasional genius eclipses, but until now lost 19 of the 29 matches to fourballs and foursomes, of which seven were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning four-ball session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson on the foursome test and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe, however, had no obstacles to this pleasant and cool day in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, the triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the star for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win with 2-1 a match played against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, then they came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 to 3 in the foursome test, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has managed a team to recover a four-point deficit in simple evidence, though, because they are the current trophy owners, Furyk's players need only an equal result.
However, after being in the second two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea states that there is no "no chance" to disarm unilaterally as long as there is no trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that the extension of the sanctions would deepen the lack of confidence in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the Global Council that "significant measures have been implemented in North Korea to prove good faith" last year, such as the halting of nuclear tests and rocket testing, the dismantling of nuclear testing locations and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“ However, we see no adequate response from the US,” he said.
“If we can’t trust the U.S., we won’t trust our national security capabilities and, under such circumstances, we can’t disarm our first unilaterals.”
Although Ri reiterated the family objections of North Korea to Washington's opposite resistance to a "exploited" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it made step-by-step, its statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearisation, as did the Phenian in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in a first-time summit between a US-led president and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to make progress towards a "declaration of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea sought an official end to the Korean War in 1950-1953, but the United States stated that Phenian must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not given way to requests for the relaxation of international sanctions imposed by North Korea.
"SUA insists on the option "first denuclearisation" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even objecting to "declaration of the conclusion of the war," Ri said.
“The impression that the sanctions can bow to us is an illusion that only people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the sanctions prolong our confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader referred to at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, president of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: “If the problem of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this price.”
Even under these circumstances, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he said for the UN General Assembly that it is inevitable to target the U.S. territory with rockets in North Korea after "The Evil President" Trump called Kim a "man-in-law" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but pointed out that the work just starts and that the sanctions will remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there is no planned time for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it lasts two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the Phenian should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday for the UN Security Council: “The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearisation.”
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed by North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block the funds for nuclear programmes and the ballistic missiles of Phenian.
Pompeo met with Ri in the color of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Phenian again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have any good results.
When he left Phenian in July, he said there was progress, but after only a few hours, North Korea denounced that he had made “gangsterist threats”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has committed to deploying a rocket launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
He said Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” that he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat growing macho culture that makes them subject to “all night” learning sessions, energized with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that sometimes students at the world’s most prestigious universities do not even possess the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this guy in the USA.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came and said to me, ‘Why do I have to be told this just now in the last year?’
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said for The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance as well as the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after he discovered that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The course that lasts an hour can involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within a section is presented the image of a room of home, and students can click on coffee meats, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
“We know we can’t change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
Culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, further says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed by students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, said it, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain believe that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course, after participating in one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to be asked to complete a similar program of studies before joining this institution where the competition is high.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for the hour of awakening, and to know what the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal takes down Gerrard's team
Rangers suffers from another case of depression on the move because Dolly Menga's strike sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team on Hebox wanted to win the first victory on the move from triumphal 4-1 obtained in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as coach, which puts Rangers with eight points behind Hearts, the authoritarian leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga wrote seven minutes before the break and uninspired players from Rangers never seemed to be able to match.
Rangers thus fell on the sixth position in the ranking, while Livingston climbed the third place, behind Hibernian, to a single goal difference.
And Rangers could face other problems, because the Calum Spence cougher had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, apparently, thrown from the fan's lawn to the visiting team.
Gerrard changed eight players from the lot that won easy against Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players at Livingstone who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has all the reasons to be proud of how his well-trained lot suffocated his opponents during the game.
Even though Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used more effectively the balls they had.
It should have marked just two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first step propelled Scott Pittman to the gate defended by Allan McGregor, but the middle missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free shot by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
Rangers took over control, but they left the impression that more hope than they trust their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he met Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but Arbitrator Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers only managed two hits on the gate in the first stop, but the former porter of Hebox, Liam Kelly, was not at all disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or by Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although the 34th minute gap at Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was worth it either for the effort it put forward.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent a deep center of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, which kept his calm and cared about Menga, who finished with a simple hit.
Gerrard acted at the pause, when he changed Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this movement almost paid off immediately, when the extreme centred Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the barrels to block it.
But Livingston continued to lure visitors into exactly the same type of match he prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting the center after the center.
Holt's team could have extended their advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' hit, then Lithgow sent his head around the corner door.
Glenn Middleton, reserved for Rangers, asked for a penalty at the end of the game, when he hit Jacobs, but again Thomson disagreed.
Almanah: Geiger accountant inventor
And now, a page in our Sunday morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the numbered CONTINUE...), is the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger meter.
An essential device for science since then, Count Geiger has become essential and for pop culture, as happened in the film "Clopes of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played in the role of cowboys with unlikely scientific tendencies:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these hats, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Yes, there’s a lot of punches!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he turned 63.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "detect" and destroy harmful cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and are then reinjected
A test vaccine offers promising results in patients with a cancer range.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a common protein of many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “determines the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to remove the immune cells from the patients and to “teach them” to target cancer cells, has also worked to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a supportive dialogy of Trump, while wearing a MAGA cap, after his appearance at SNL.
It didn't come out too well
Kanye West was taken to the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a disbanded show praising U.S. president Donald Trump and said he intends to run for the 2020 elections.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Cape Make America Great, the artist disbanded himself in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump?’
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began its show with a scene playing Matt Damon, in which the star of Hollywood took over the leg of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's right-hand footage was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take West over with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems in the backseat because of his sect.
“They tried to intimidate me in the backseat.
They said, "Don't wear this cap."
I was assaulted!
They also told me that I got really low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see how far down we have arrived?", then he said, “I’m gonna get Superman’s coat, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want people to evolve?
Try with love."
His comments attracted public cases at least twice, and the members of the SNL team seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported; a person in this team said to the publication: “In the studio there was a complete silence.”
West was invited as a last-hour substitute for soloist Ariana Grande, who was loved, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of eyebrows when I Love played it as a glass of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits among us: Thank you that you've been in trouble."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West, simply "was himself and that's wonderful."
"I do choose not to reward someone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") about which I believe he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he has changed his name, announcing that from now on it is "the official establishment known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West is following Diddy, previously known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known as Prince".
Prosecution of attempted murder for a stabilising in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was stabbed in an Eastern Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defence lawyer is expected to be in front of the Belfast Court for months.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the throne Urzel, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for Jon Snow's role in the series of violent medieval fantasy Throne Urzel, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on screen makes the boys think it must be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that it seemed to him that "something wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague from the Throne Urzel, Rose Leslie, who is all 31 years old, admitted that she is "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personally, I am very determined to talk about it now: where have I been wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men about how to be adults, considering the problem we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What does the young boys teach on TV and on the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something has happened wrong with young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play in any kind of series based on the Thrones Urzeal after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that he “was finished with the battlefields and horses.”
Since November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West theater piece by Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thug.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of the series of Thrones Urzeal is that he knew his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I made this series, so it assured me of the future of my family and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of several Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in the number of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly to some areas in China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was almost zero, says the Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered very widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, the studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission come from inappropriate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to drugs against HIV as part of the effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has released the data of Senators of the Republican Party, talks about "dangerous minorities" and "the theory of conspiracy"
The representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations on Saturday that a member of his team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were made by analysts and "right end" websites.
"The lies, the lies and other despicable lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
The disclosed information included the senators' personal addresses and phone numbers. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of improper sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as Judge at the Supreme Court.
The intelligence leak took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and presented the information of a team member of Waters, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“Member of the team, whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leaking of such information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have the temperament needed to be a Member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they don't have to be furious.
He doesn't have to be suspicious.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
You must be calm and calm."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during the Tuesday hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is running against Waters in mid-term elections, also commented on Twitter.
“ Important, if it is true, ” he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had alerted “the appropriate legal authorities and entities to these false charges.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered,” she continued, “and that they will respond to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.”
Review Johnny English hits again: open parody of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to look for some of Brexit's associated meanings in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the series of parodys of action films that has as its main character Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will this desflecting satire be able to become the nation's new export opportunity?
Johnny English's incompetent spy with staring eyes and rubber face, has been renewed for the second time the license to ruin everything. The name of the character means, first, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematographic audience in the non-speaking English countries.
He is, of course, the scrupulous secret agent who, despite his luxury and extravagance claims, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of that guy who contributed with one note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
The character is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without a country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind.
This last JE adventure also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet easily.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is quite weak and, strangely, superfluous, especially because the "serious" films, such as those of the 007 series or impossible Mission, confidently provide comical moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to address children more than adults and, for me, Johnny English's daring adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's silent movie gags when they play Bean's role.
As usual, the premise always is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain's supersecret spy web network and revealed the identities of English agents undercover, to the despair of the service agent, a regrettable role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister in Pompos and under siege, who already suffers a severe crisis due to the decline of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything he can with his fellow character Theresa May, but the scenario does not give him the chance to shine.
Its secret information advisors inform it that all active spies have been compromised, so they need to activate a reserved agent.
It's Johnny English's own zevzet, now working as a teacher at a high-class school, which gives lessons about how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute stutters, because English runs a spy academy in the School of Rock style.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency meeting, then is reunited with his old partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, the role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
Thus, these Batman and Robin of creating messes in the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls into the spell of a billion-dollar charismatic technological industry that claims he can solve the IT problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start in a odyssey of bourgeois adventures: dressed in waiters, set a French fashion restaurant on fire, create chaos when crawling on board Volta's luxury ship, then triggers purely shaped anarchies when they try to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize themselves with Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the film seems to be, it seems a television production for children.
A pretty mediocre film.
As with the other films with Johnny English, can't I stop asking myself: Can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to measure his talent?
The workers deny that they plan to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the heads of companies to take advantage of the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) by giving employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a week of three days, but the salary would not have changed.
The sources say that the idea would "opportunity" with the party's economic programme, which wants to tilt the balance in favour of workers.
The four-day shift is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way by which workers can benefit from changing the economy.
A source from the Labour Party’s leadership said for The Sunday Times: “A policy review announcement is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a proper aspiration in the approach of the economic recovery party to the worker's favor, as well as in the overall strategy of the industry party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 campaign for general elections.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.”
The Chancellor Lord of the Shadow Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that it is determined to take back the power from the "frontline directors" and "profiters" from the utility companies.
The plans of the Chancellor of the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supply regions may not recover their actions in full, because the Labour Government could perceive "deductions" because of the crimes found.
It also confirmed plans to appoint employees in company management councils and to create ownership funds by assigning 10% of the private sector’s own capital to employees, which will thus receive annual dividends up to about 500 lire.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy revealed in the show "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh would make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question whether Republican senators could be persuaded to stop supporting him because of the FBI findings.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his South Carolina colleague.
"Certainly," said Kennedy.
“I said this at the beginning of the hearing; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, soon, without error."
Graham's vote, however, seems dug in stone.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so there would be a need for some explosive charges," he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly rejects the charges," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people named by her confirmed the story.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something will change."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and has managed to do something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens' Festival, an annual musical event to which an impressive group of stars will participate, with an equally impressive mission: the elimination of world poverty.
Up to the seventh edition, the Global Citizens' Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park lawn, not only to pursue artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the spectators had to pay for a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making telephone calls or other significant things to help increase awareness of the goal of global poverty elimination.
But what success has the Festival of Global Citizens when there are only 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism", concept that refers to people who feel they have done something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, in 2011 more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded from its supporters, which have promoted different objectives.
The organization says that these actions have spurred world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in the account of which at least $10 billion was already spent or tight.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with headquarters in the United Kingdom of investors and intermediaries who have committed themselves to "help children grow to their full potential", which promised to offer Rwande $35 million to contribute to the elimination of malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 messages on Twitter from global citizens.
"With the help of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition only become a footnote in the book of history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of the crowd during a live concert in London, in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered: “It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid moves that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will play this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use naval forces for a "blocada" that would make Russia's energy exports difficult, says the Interior Secretary
Washington may, "if necessary", call for naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, revealed U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermediate energy sales, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and methods of managing the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not go out on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declared itself “the voice of the consumer of energy” in the USA.
It continued to compare how Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia, "you know one trick" because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when Trump is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are attempting to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would transform Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, at 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin said that US fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we are looking at things the same way: energy cannot be an instrument by which pressure is put and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Russian energy minister, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state intervenes in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks seriously" to run the presidential elections of 2020, said the senator in Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Senator, said on Saturday that he must be "serious" if he is to run the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting at the City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that's why a strong woman is needed," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will think seriously about running the presidential elections."
Warren had something to say about President Donald Trump during the meeting at the city hall, saying that he “turned the country in the wrong direction”.
“I’m deeply worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate appointed by him to the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that no majority of Warren's voters think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidature.
The survey showed more support for a candidature of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% are against.
Other names of well-known democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator de Vermont.
Biden said it would be decided officially by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress syndrome that Track Palin suffers at a Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and accused in a domestic violence case
“The things my own son is going through, which he went through after he has returned... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of posttraumatic stress syndrome and the follow-up to the injuries that our soldiers return to,” Donald Trump told the public gathered at a rally to support him in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "turned a little different, tougher, back wondering if there was any respect for what they and their soldiers from armed and air forces, as well as all other members of the army, did for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence and holding a firearm in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, the spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Columbia District contests a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a legal challenge of the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape violence caused by the search or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District completed a friendly request for curiae Friday, in Washington, to support a challenge to asylum policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in Grace v. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
It said that her partner “and the violent, members of a gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing a generalized problem with the search and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled a 2014 decision of the Council for the Appeals of Immigrants that allowed immigrants without acts trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of Columbia District, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“The federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such a limitation violates this principle,” writes the friendly request curiae.
In addition, lawyers argue in demand that the policy that refuses the entry of immigrants affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour force.
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, in June, ordered judges for immigration cases not to grant asylum to victims trying to escape abuse and violence of the birds.
“The asylum is granted to those who leave their country motivated by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on 11 June when it announced policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a timer race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who joins her baby suffering from fever at an evacuation center in the city destroyed Palu.
“The ambulations bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale, were exceeded by the situation.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in the vertebral column and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous replications.
He has eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room from the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“ We didn’t have time to save.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris said for Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and to my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "misleading"
A week after an official China newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing that he uses the US press to distribute propaganda material.
US President Donald Trump referred to the Chinese supplement paid in Des Moines Register on Wednesday, the best seller of the Iowa newspaper, after accusing China of joining the 6 November elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The charge that Beijing is trying to mix in the U.S. elections marked what US officials said for Reuters that it is a new phase in a Washington escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war involving import tariff increases.
The charges imposed by China as revenge, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and business people.
In an editorial published on Sunday in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues to abuse this by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press”.
“When propaganda spreads through advertising in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of free speech and free press in America,” says Branstad.
"On the other hand, at the newsstand on the street in Beijing you will find few voices of the dissidents and you will see no real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say what the paper was about.
Republicans alienate female voters before mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh scandal, warns analysts
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warned that there would be a contradiction, especially from women, during future mid-term elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and most Republicans who talked publicly about it intend to continue the vote.
"So the reactions won't be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last moment (representative of Arizone) initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget tomorrow and they won't forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesperson of the progressive group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors scanned "Come November!" while demonstrating in the Senate halls when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite testimony Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said Mic.
"Enthusiasm and the motivation of Democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the indecisive female voters of the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they do not favor the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the sexual abuse charges brought to the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it might follow a counter-reaction if the Republicans continued the confirmation process.
"This has become an issue for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee's vote or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh will be confirmed, but also how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, an electoral support group for the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part that they should believe in after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more people seem to believe him later.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe that Ford's testimony is likely to be true, while 35% said they strongly believe it or it's likely that Kavanaugh's testimony is true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations, as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore to the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh abused her, drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominationist at the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs to her face as she participated in a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest history project in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, the open-source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt is "global dominance".
"Now we have to do it," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data archives" or PODs.
It may contain lists of contacts, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be available all in one browser, all of a sudden.
What's unique about this personal data archive online is that the user has full control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal consolidation by data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt contributes with adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a complete change when their business models are completely messed up at once.
"We do not ask for permission."
In a post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even after Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The clergy who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War is celebrated
The only cleric of the Anglican Church who won a Victoria Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the attack from Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honor of Great Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said he was “skinned with symbolicness ” that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin “to a very dense fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns”.
Later, he rushed into the first line and, with "a fantastic bravery", opened the path of the soldiers, then attacked alone a nest of artillery and managed to eliminate three of the weapons of the detachment.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years of age, said that his grandfather’s actions were “one thing I know I will never be able to equal, but it makes me feel like I am. ”
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him."
The MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, but they got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you can't follow the main event.
The program of the San Jose event contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, Britain's spectators were amazed when the transmission was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they stayed awake all night to watch the fight.
One fan described Twitter as "a kind of bad joke" for children's cartoon.
"Governmental regulations say that this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator's company, said that in the future, they will also plan their events so that they can also be followed by spectators in Britain.
“When I think about replays, I think we could probably work it out,” Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning one Sunday here and we won't be able to do this by Sunday, our time, or months, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about a government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
We will sum up five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give fans more and we exceeded the limit.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sexuality
Olympic scumbag Tom Daley says he's grown up feeling he's inferior because of his sexuality, but this has motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he only realized when he got to school that "not everyone is like me."
Invited to the first show Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he talks about gay people's rights to give them "hope".
The sport also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the traditional show, will be missing a few months due to a disease.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "less" to others because "it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls."
He said: "To date, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different were the real things that gave me the strength and strength to gain success."
He wanted to prove himself “someone, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they eventually learned about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a renowned champion of the LGBT campaigns and has taken advantage of the appearance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to call on several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live free, without pursuit, and because he wanted to give to others "hope".
The triple world champion said it was “surprised” by the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year to the winner of the Oscar award, which is 20 years older than him, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age, ” he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who had gone through the same good and bad times.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, says Daley, has changed his “perspective whole”.
“If I had been asked last year, I would only have been interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if he had received tickets for the 2012 London Olympic Games because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t say, ‘You won’t be first, Dad’,” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and died did I finally accept that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of a whole life, to jump in front of my country’s spectators at the Olympic Games, there is no more beautiful feeling,” he said.
This inspired him also in the chosen music, Proud of Heather Small, songs that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excited him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Miccelson, out of shape, was passed to the reserve bank on Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Miccelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seventh game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to return to a good shape so that it is not an unfortunate occasion.
Micchelson, who plays in the biennial event for the 12th time, another record, was passed on to the reserve bank of Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and forsomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it was many times for the United States team, the winning quarter of major tournaments shared the day between being major for teammates and exercising their blows, hoping that it would correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player never had the rightest drives, not even in the best time of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow terrain of Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish the wrong hits.
And if the land isn't a big enough challenge, in the new Miccelson Sunday game, he'll face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who has allied himself with the novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Miccelson's game could prove absolutely crucial for Americans, driven by four points at the entrance to the 12 simple games, which must begin forcefully at this stage.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
“He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on my shoulder, hugged me, and told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he was gonna play in two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened, and that's how I thought we had to proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Miccelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which was no longer at the level of his personal record.
Miccelson has 18 winning matches, 20 lost and seven half, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
“It’s funny, it’s sarcastic, smart, he likes to joke with players, he’s a great guy in the team’s locker,” he explained.
“I think young players are having fun with him, it was fun to see him doing that during the week.
Its role is more important, not just to play."
Captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple evidence in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 Valderrama game, when the team led by Captain Seven Ballesteros drove the Americans five points, but only if he managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
“I remind myself that I had a considerable advance at Valderrama; I had a big advance at Brookline, where I lost, and at Valderrama, where I barely managed to win,” Bjorn said (in the picture) after he followed how the 2018 team, who won with 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now runs with 10-6 Le Golf National.
"So, history shows me, me and my team, that it's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play on the maximum tour.
Let's get out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are passed on the table.
We have a purpose and this is to win this trophy, it has to remain the goal.
I always said, we need to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know and what is expected in the other part: the best players in the world."
Enthralled by the way his players managed on a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I am not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow's a whole different situation.
Individual performance is important tomorrow, and this is different.
It's wonderful to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to maximum, as a golf player.
This is the message that you have to transmit to players, that must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as I can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play more simply than they did with partners except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was by both sides of such returns on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the lost one when Europe managed the "Miracle of the Medina".
"Remember every word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain of 1999, succeeded to encourage his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like in Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, put a lot of pressure on those middle games.
We created the proper lot and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with leading the fight: he will face Rory McIllroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I chose this group of players, in this order, because I believe it covers all the subjects," Bjorn said about the batch for simple proof.
Germany's new warship, delayed again
The latest fleet of German naval forces should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the war vessels in the Cold War, but this will only happen in the year, due to defective systems and rising costs, the local press reported.
The entry into service of the “Rheinland-Pfalz” ship, the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, who reads a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be introduced into maritime forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery have affected this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Military Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is assumed that they will be provided with a strong cannon, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas rockets, as well as with stealth technologies, which ensures a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to be able to leave on missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, the continued delays mean that these war vessels of the last generation, which are said to increase the maritime force of Germany, will already be aged before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
F125 Freighted Ghinionist was discussed last year in the press, when the German Military Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Military Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Not much information is available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware" that would have made the warship useless on a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because vessels in Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crew on the oldest frigates in the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been shown that the vessel has a much too heavy weight, which has reduced its performance and limited the capacity of the Military Navy to add future equipment.
The 7,000-ton “Rheinland-Pfalz” vessel is believed to be twice as hard as German vessels in World War II.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, and the price of the entire project, including the crew training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an amazing figure of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the original price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates end with special importance given the latest warnings that say German maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Commission, acknowledged that the Military Navy “has begun to remain without vessels that can be sent to missions.”
The official said that the problem has grown steadily over time, as the old vessels have been removed without being replaced with new ones.
It deplored the fact that none of the frigates in Baden-Wuerttemberg class came into operation within the Military Navy.
National Trust spyes on the secret life of bats
New researches that are carried out on a Scottish Highlands property want to reveal how they use the surrounding environment bat to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will analyze common pictic bats and pygmy bats as well as ear bats and water bats from the Invewe Gardens of Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be located in key places around the property to track the activity of bats during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
The specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of the sounds made by bats and what species emit certain sounds.
They will also be produced and a habitat map and a report, to create a detailed, scaled picture of their environmental behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grassland, and which is the best way to maintain forest forests for bats and other associated species.
Lille populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work that affects the nests, but also by habitat loss.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, just as are flies traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks on domestic cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated echo technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, thinks very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, control the nests and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization even created the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of ten species of bats in Scotland are found.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here at Thrave, the area is wonderful for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need them to multiply."
It underlines the importance of looking for bats before doing maintenance work on properties, because simply unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chickens, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected, and killing, harassment or harassment, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the audience to help them.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species. ”
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "will advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
Portugal's attacker and the Juventus team were accused of violating a woman in America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the winner of the Golden Balloon in front of the video room.
“ I want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous by using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of these charges, which they have called "an inadmissible report of life-threatening suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player will seek compensation for “corresponding moral damage with an adequate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident would take place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed at the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told him that he was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "a percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Majora claims that she addressed the police and that photographs of her injuries were made at the hospital, but later she accepted an understanding outside the courtroom because she was "sterified by the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that she would "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now looking to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian Giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "will regret forever" loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "sorry forever" if it lost the status of world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, the Secretary for Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it is “worry” that Toyota UK has declared for BBC that, if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory at Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis brands of Toyota are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that, if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Executive Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they were afraid of exiting the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a non-agreement Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of the "fix time" principle: for cars manufactured at the command, the pieces arrive at 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there might be problems on the border, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than the inventory for a day at his Derbyshire factory, the company says, so the production would have stopped.
Clark said that Therose May's Chekers plan for future EU relations is "precisely balanced to avoid these delays at the border."
“There must be an agreement. We want to have the best deal, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said for the BBC Radio 4 show.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other producers shows that we must continue to use what was a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not specify how long production will have to be stopped, but warned that higher prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the long-term factory and eventually lead to job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who works in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union trade union at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: “Experience has taught me that, after the disappearance, these jobs are no longer coming back.”
A government spokesman said: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "due another week" because the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Trump's and Russia's aid and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
The rumors about Trump's firing the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Early in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president by means of amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the reports claim he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced for Thursday a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the New York headquarters of the United Nations.
Trump said that he would rather not "don't" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's legal commission, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked for a one-week FBI inquiry into the charges against Kavanaugh, which he postponed, again, the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “Even though it has not been established once, it may be this week or may be delayed a week, taking into account all the other things that are now happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would challenge this statement: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on September 10.
Gazda Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by the antipathy to TV reporters, who like to play, although he added: “I don’t deny that they like to show.”
Then he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president took part in several sessions of questions and answers than all previous presidents,” she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: “I have analyzed the figures.”
"There will be briefings," Sanders said, but "it seems much better that the press have the opportunity to ask the questions directly to the President of the United States, not to me.
We're trying to do this most of the time and you could notice that we've done this many times in the last few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences with his visitors.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an improvised appearance, on bizarre locations, in front of the assembled reporters.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health is addressed in a letter to EU employees of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on Brexit-related issues
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS subsidiary in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain with Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under the conditions under which there are less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to bear the costs for applications to receive permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be taken this fall.
But the United Kingdom government began to prepare more and more for a different scenario, where there would be no EU exit agreement.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I wish to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleges in the European Union, but also outside it, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the activity of health service and also bring benefits to patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is subjected to emergency surgery after having suffered a head strike
The founder of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered a head strike on Saturday, in the game that his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodoros team, score 31-27, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The lead coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
“He got to the cough line and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by the physical trainers and medical staff, on the cough line, before sitting on a tart and carrying it from the ground for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie came out of the operation he was subjected to at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/exploitation of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a student in the year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, it managed to make five total plaques before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 plaques throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp judicial fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp legal fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom, following that additional money is used for helping homeless people, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
Legal stamp tax will be applied to persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million per year for the aid of homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used for helping homeless people, as is to be announced today Theresa May.
The change will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with voting rights, promising houses with more advantageous prices and seeing people with high incomes.
The higher stamp judicial fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help the homeless.
Suprataxa, which is added to the current stamp judicial fee, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for the purpose of the lease, could reach a 3% value.
The Treasury expects this change to bring an extra up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to rising prices and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
More prosperous parts of the country, especially the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks since Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp court fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of the purchase of land without using them and asked Thersie May to drop taxes on affordable houses in order to solve the "house problem" in the UK.
Corbyn announced a number of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent checks and the cessation of unintended evacuations.
He also wishes to give the Councils greater powers in the construction of new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my Prime Minister to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means solving the problems existing on the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with foreign seats, to be able to buy houses as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become a far too distant one, and life in undemnity is far too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be the manager of the national team of Scotland"
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that his final objective was to become, at some point, the national team manager of Scotland.
Scotsman, 42 years of age, enjoys the challenge of "reviving" the north-eastern club, which is currently in the 3rd place in the First League, with a three-point difference from the first place.
He moved to the team on the Stadium of Light this summer after last season, the return of the St. Mirren football team to the first Scottish Premiership division.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
I got to the national team B and that's it," Ross said for Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
"But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland's matches in Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will have this opportunity only if I succeed as club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors, as manager of the Sunderland club, are Dick Advocacy, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager of the Alloa Athletic club said he had no emotions to be the successor of such consecrated names and to such an important club, after he refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that concerns me and that could affect my success is the question “Can I help this team return to the Premier League?”
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities existing in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to make her get there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to Premier League."
Ross has only three years of experience in management, after a period during which he was an assistant manager in Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the Alloa club come back after he went back to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from backgrading, helping the team win the championship title in the next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking over the lead of the Alloa club.
“I really thought I was more of a manager than a player.
Maybe it sounds weird, 'cause we had a good time, we earned well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I'm dealing with similar situations as a manager, with regard to stress and pressure, but I feel it's the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do this, I feel that it's the best thing I've got to do with my entire adult life."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30, between 12:00 and 13:00 at the Sportsound show at Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink a beer bee is Saturday, 5:30 p.m., according to a survey
This summer’s heat volume has led to an increase in revenues in the UK’s pubs, however putting more pressure on the chain of restaurants.
According to figures, pubs and bars had an increase of 2.7% in July, while the incomes of the restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the representative of the CGA that provides business consultancy services and carried out the survey, said: “Continual heat and England’s participation in the World Cup over a longer period than expected contributed to a printing in July, similar to the previous month, when pubs registered with up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers smaller than 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June has declined further in July.
Pubs and bars serving drinks only recorded a profit far greater than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food have recorded losses caused by heat, but not as large as those of restaurants.
Looks like people just came out to eat drinks.
Drink sales at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, the representative of the RSM that provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of sporting and social-wide events remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales associated with the OHS advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decrease in sales by 4.8% year will be added to current cost pressures.
Long summer caniculars cannot come at a bad time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the low number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds, which is the official industry standard.
One of five children has a secret account on a social network that hides from parents
According to a survey, one of five children, some even up to 11 years old, has a secret account on a social network that hides from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 gymnasium students revealed an increase in "false Insta" accounts
Knowledge has raised fears about sexual content posts
20% of students said they had a "primary" account showing their parents
One of five children, some even aged up to 11, creates an account on a social network that keeps them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 gymnasium students revealed a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing platform.
Knowledge has raised fears about posts with sexual content.
20% of students said they had a "primary" and "clean" account that their parents showed, but they also had other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, observed the post of a teenager who wanted to be “violet”.
According to research carried out by the Digital Awareness company in the United Kingdom and the directory association (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference) of the independent schools, 40% of the young people aged 11 to 18 years have two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they own secret accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers do not have access.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Scots Athletic Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected as Director, without executive power, of the Commission of the Athletes in Scotland, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated atlet de terrain and track in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, has described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions on sports to take advantage of the vast experience it has acquired at international level over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes in Scotland, Great Britain, as well as around the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with his inclusion in the commission,” Beattie said.
Doyle also said: “I am pleased that I will be able to represent athletes and hope to have a real contribution and can help with sport activities in Scotland.”
The American Athlete of Nationality, which won the 200 and 400 metre samples at the 1996 Atlanta Games in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at the BBC, remained invalid after he suffered a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide if I'll recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go again, and today I do agile exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertising that compares women with cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A breast pumping company has caused the division of public opinion in the online environment to be compared to mothers who are breast-feeding with cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be "the first silent and portable breast pump in the world," Elvie's consumer technology company launched an ironic commercial, inspired by a music video, to present the freedom that the new pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cows on a song that includes such verses as: “Yes, thank you, but I have no tail” and “if you have not noticed, they are not weasel, but my breasts.”
“ Pumping, pumping, breast feeding, pumping, pumping, extracting milk from girls, ” continues the cooler.
However, the complaint, published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them saying that it is out of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that they are stolen children only a few days after birth," wrote one person.

Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Others added: "A highly inappropriate commercial."
Other people defended the commercial, a person claiming to have been a "hilarious" commercial.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if we were still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a bird.
The claim is a little inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is great," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun commercial for mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘good luck’.
It's not a commercial that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with discreet pumps introduced into bras.
The concept that lies at the base of the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like mouths.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, it does not have wires or tubes and it fits discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women freedom of movement, the possibility of holding their children in arms and even going out to the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner, consultant and design developer at Mother commented: “Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
By comparing breast feeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump and challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time Elvie pump gets on the first page.
During the presentation of the fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred to a refugee camp at the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children increased, although the number of people who passed the border each month remained relatively the same, largely because rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by Trump administration caused the difficulty of placing children in sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and fear they will endanger their stay in the country if they ask to take children.
Risks increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must record their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of the customs and immigration authority (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we're gonna keep looking for that guy," Albence said.
In order to speed up the processing procedure in the children's system, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children must be present at the court within one month of detention, and not at 60 days as provided for in the previous standard, according to the employees of the shelters.
Many will plead for the case by means of a video call, and not personally before an immigration judge, to request the status of a legal resident.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more they may become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to the employees of the shelters and reports issued by the system in recent months.
The lawyers said that these concerns are accentuated to a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that the signs indicating that a child has no problems are not observed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare for the emotional situation or to get back to their friends could cause trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria calls for American, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria was at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also interim prime minister, said that foreign military forces are illegally located in a Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that “the situation will be properly managed”.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any condition," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been destroyed from their homes.
He also stated that Damascus will continue “this sacred battle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.”
In Syria, there are about 2,000 military troops in the United States, which deal in particular with the training and counseling of Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the devastated country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Moualem said that there are favourable conditions for their return and accused “a few Western countries” of “the spread of irrational fears”, which led refugees to keep their distance.
He added: "I have called for the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return."
“Political influences are brought into a problem that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there will be a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the conclusion of the war.
The United Nations Diplomats state that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to alienate the last group of rebels created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has contributed to the avoidance of a large assault by Syrian forces, supported by Russians, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has “clear boundary terms” and expressed its hope that military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have ties to the Al-Qaeda network and which “must be eradicated”.
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations emissary, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee of government members and opposition to drafting a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the Committee's activities should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning on interference.
Why Will Win Trump's Second Term?
If we follow this logic, Trump will be back in 2020, except when the removal procedure or the scandals will end his president's mandate earlier, which most of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case, there would be no doubt, “the most dramatic final of a president's term of office of all time.”
Until now, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, the first-time audiences have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the prime time, Fox News television station was followed on average by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast recorded a record of hearing, with 3.5 million people who followed it in the evenings where important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we can't understand it," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC 'Reservative President' drama series, about a cabinet secretary who is president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with a vast field experience and authoring "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why did she ask.
“He said, “Because he makes me laugh,” Scovell told me.
In chaos, fun is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else is broadcast on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of Roe versus Wade if immigrant families can be fully integrated and about the state of the global economy.

However, you are not only an informed citizen when you reach the sixth hour of vision of the debate by an expert committee of the way Bob Woodward uses deep background (confidential) sources for his book, "Fear", about Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather jacket ("an opulent garment object", according to The Washington Post) and the shocking implications of the actress Stormy Daniels's "anatomical parts".
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"A lot of what makes you feel like watching a reality show and feeding you on topics every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment media group and the creator of the "Asi Amulet" show, about the constantly changing distribution and the daily changes caused by Trump (deployment of a degree with the American Football Professional League, the praises brought to Kim Jong-Un).

When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his home on the northern shore of the Kauai island, out there were 27 degrees and there was sun, and he was in there looking at MSNBC and recording on CNN.
It could not be released from the front of the television, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate's legal commission and the future Supreme Court was to decide.
“I remember making some shows out of common in the past, and people said, “This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right."

Overcoming external financial resources for the closest intermediate choices associated with the Chamber of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of the electoral districts, of which two mandate holders have been in an election race for the same function, it is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th electoral district enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburg district has brought in the race the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections of last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps significantly with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, being manipulated the boundaries of the districts in favour of the republicans.
The new 17th electoral district has launched a competition in funding campaigns between important party funding bodies, the Congress Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in special elections, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of the State of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, Democrats enjoy an easy advantage.
The United States took into account the penalisation of the State of El Salvador because of its agreement with China, but then gave up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with President of the Panamanian Republic, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization’s management team.
The State Department officials have decided to call the heads of the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of the "new decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the Department in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions were taken against the State of El Salvador, which received US aid of approximately $140 million in 2017, including for the control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country of Central America and the high rate of unemployment and crime in that country.
As internal meetings have made progress, officials from North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference, focused on security and economic prosperity, to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the targeting of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials clearly showed that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned that Vice-President Mike Pence address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance that the administration gives to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of keeping the anonymous.
Study of history
The next thing that might happen is the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is guiding his investigation and the investigation of the existence of a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia with regard to the attack on American elections.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due responsibility within the body, even when he is prepared to appear before his constituents and possibly a jury of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump’s “fall” is inevitable, which is also true for his European counterparts.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to give a coup against Hitler, only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
I failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face a few such critical moments right now.
What are we going to do if Trump's Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year she suggested secret registration of the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times newspaper's story is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigations concerning Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and lying testimony?
And above all, will we vote for the intermediate elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman of Czech origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied me, long ago, the ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday candles on the table with zvastics.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans player from the Rangers team is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna game
On Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian match, after the impressive match in Spain against the Villarreal team from the beginning of the month, will place it on a strong position to qualify for the Group G of the European League.
A knee accident did not allow the middle Graham Dorrans to play this season until equal to 2-2 with Villarreal, but it considers that the Rangers team can use this result in its advantage to achieve better performances.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player said.
“We started the game thinking that we will get a good result and we won a point.
I probably could've signed up at the end, but I think the equal was a fair result.
I think they were better at the first stop, and we've noticed better at the second one.
Thursday, it will be a very important night for Europe again.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game. However, with supporting supporters, we will certainly feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and club changes, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; training also goes well.
Let us hope that we will persevere, that we will leave the last season behind and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnia because of retirement savings
Despite the fact that polling participants knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the study carried out by the Nationwide company claimed to discuss the cost of long-term care with their husband.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about this.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t start this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your husband/sister and children: You can't prepare your family to provide the care you need if you don't make your wishes known in time.
Work with the counselor and with the family to discuss the place and how you will receive care, because these choices could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Involve your financial adviser: and the financial adviser may be of real help in paying such expenditure.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can ensure your own welfare – to the extent that you have the money.
Set up legal documents: come to the face of legal issues.
Get a powers on medical decisions, to designate a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Also take into account the exercise of power over your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not just about the financial side. Can you tell me who the doctors are dealing with about it,” Martin asked.
“What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Make a plan for all these things."
A man was shot several times with an air gun compressed in Ilfracombe

Victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 p.m., as “chance shots”.
The victim failed to see his attacker.
The wounds suffered did not put his life in danger, and the police appealed to witnesses to give statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and is expected to increase the number of deaths.
Due to the interruption of the communications networks, disaster management authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Dogalga Regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are a few key informations about Palu and Dogula, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the center of the island of Sulawesi, which lies at the end of a narrow golf course on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunami and earthquake.
Dogalia is a regency that stretches over a coast with a surface of over 300 km in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Region, an administrative region located below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming activities are the central point of the province's economy in the center of the island of Sulawesi, in particular the Dogalga coastal region.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in the Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Disaster Management Agency in Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Also, in 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of Dogalia, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have taken place in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people on the Indian coast, more than half being from Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake with magnitude of 6.8 degrees on the Richter scale struck the southernmost Indonesian island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.

2018: More powerful earthquakes took place on the tourist island Lombok, causing the death of more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists remained temporarily trapped under debris.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29 years old, in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and in opposition to the arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the police in Alaska State.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to sue the alleged crimes, she took her phone.
Palin is in police custody, in the Mat-Su unit, waiting for the trial, and is held on the basis of a security-free cage, worth $500, according to KTUU.
It was presented on Saturday in court, where it was declared “100% innocent” when the petition was requested, according to the network.
Palin is facing three charges of Class A crime, which means that he could be imprisoned for a period of up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin's accusations have been brought.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged assault.
The case is under trial at the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, engaging in a complaint of a domestic violence crime and holding a weapon while he was drunk about an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after being part of the Iraqi military forces.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred off the central Sulawesi province, which is north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Socialization networks circulate videos that present the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor wants capital punishment for the terrorist attack suspect in New York City
The New York Federal Prosecutor's Office wishes the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City after which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that was no longer applied in the state for a federal offense in 1953.
It seems that Saipov, aged 30, used a truck rented Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track on the West Side highway of the Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and bikers on its path in October.
In order to justify capital punishment, the prosecutor must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intendedly” and caused “intendedly” serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent on the request for capital punishment, filed in the New York South District.
Both counts may receive a capital sentence, according to the court's document.
Within a few weeks of the attack, a major federal jury accused Saipov of 22 charges including eight criminal charges in support of organised crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required a “substantial planning and premeditation,” the prosecutor said, describing how Saipov executed the act as “odious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, sufferings and losses for the following families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the South District of New York.
The stone, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers, but finally he was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted under the conspiracy charge of committing spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents in the court, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regret in the days and months after the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that it was good for him to do what he did, as the police told him.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt inspired to execute the attack after he looked at the ISIS group videos on his phone, according to the requisitioner.
Also, according to the police, he asked to store the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded innocent with regard to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the defenses in the office that represented Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence complaint, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the associated trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the capital penalty.
A member of Parliament who is a member of the Conservative Party maintains that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of negotiations on Brexit
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Euroceptians, following a statement by a member of Parliament Theresa May who suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have come out" so far if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge that May faces in regard to the extremely divided camps was emphasized by members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against the exit of the European Union in the city.
The Prime Minister is attempting from power as his compromise plan, so-called the Chequers plan, to carry out properly, confronting the attacks on those who support the European Union's departure, those who want to remain in it, and on the European Union's side.
The Allies stressed that it would continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Euroceptians and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and "chaos".
Bone said during the pro-Brexit "Leave Means Leave" event in Solihull that she wants "renunciation to the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given responsibility to the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were driven by him, I was no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of Wellingborough, added: “I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in the world war to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied the suggestions on the change of public opinion at the 2016 vote: "It is not true that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the voices of people.
"The public disagrees with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party disagrees with him and our activists who go out on the street and who support us, first of all, the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message targeting Theresa May, it added: "The ministers who keep their function are the ones who respect their promises."
As part of the rally, Nigel Farage stated that politicians should be put in a position to "feel the pressure" if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
“Try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that “we will not let them do this.”
In a message to enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civil army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support the European Union have marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally at the center of town.
A small group of activists raised banners that the Conservative Party wrote against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for digitizing customs procedures, for free and non-restricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring any benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider running the presidency after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the Massachusetts Democratic Senate spoke on Saturday about her future during a mayor's meeting in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, member of the House of Representatives from the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could beat Trump by 2020.
The afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with the right-to-voting citizens using the mayor's office since Trump took office as president.
A participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for “women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government, and this includes the fact that in his head there is a woman.”
A suspect was arrested in the case of death that caused the death of the player Sims from the LSU team
Baton Rouge Police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the event of death that caused the death of the ball player Wayde Sims from LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson's arrest at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying the man from the picture.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the spot, that he was in possession of a weapon, but that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken to police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the original lot in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoverys on the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team will have an essential role in the race.
Finding the first position in the ranking, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two shifts and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and leave Hamilton at the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the box later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inside free after he made a double move to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Verstappen began the race in the rear row of the carnation and was in place almost seven at the end of the first tour, even on the day he was 21 years old.
Then he was at the forefront for a large part of the race, looking at a quick ending and trying to overcome Kimi Raikkonen and take over the fourth place.
Finally, he stopped on the box at the number 44 tour, but he couldn't raise the step in the last eight tours, Raikkonen remaining on the fourth.
"It was a difficult day. Valteri did an exceptional job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman, letting me go forward.
And the team did an excellent job to gain victory in front of Ferrari and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A Terrible Body Language
President Donald Trump hijacked the senate Diana Feinstein on Saturday, in a rally on the subject of his insistents such as she did not facilitate the "shortening" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court for sexual assault.
Speaking in a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee, stating instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "alien, immoral and liars".
“The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and liars,” he said.
“When you see that they published and leaked information and then they say they didn’t.
They're not responsible.
Remember?
When did I ask her if she made the document easier?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..poftim?
Oh, no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, I didn't," he added, imitating the senators.
Feinstein was sent his letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was “scurred” in September, but Feinstein denied that “scurry” occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide the charges on Ford, and I'm not the one that made it easier for her to "currage"," Feinstein said to the committee, according to the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality and that's exactly what I did."
But her denial did not seem to have been well for the president, who commented during the Saturday rally: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use accusations to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Notice the wickedness, immorality, don't care who they hurt and who they need to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said, according to the Mediaite website.

Francois Bouchard matched the score for Dundee before two goals marked by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to ensure their victory.
It was the third defeat in the League of Elites this season for the players of Adam Keefe, who had recovered land defeating the Dundee team on 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, Giants winning the last three games.

In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan returned the host team in the game in the minute 13:10, before Matt Marquardt offered him the opportunity to sign up for an equal score in the minute 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants team before the first break, when he entered his second goal at the end of the first shot.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard again matched with an impressive goal in the minute 27:37.
Later, in the second round, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen get an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that game, thus ensuring the crew's ascent to place 5 in the ranking, at the middle of the last shot.
The Giants team, who has now lost four of the last five games, will be, on Friday, host for Milton Keynes in their next match.
An air traffic controller died after ensuring the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after ensuring safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a strong earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong appeals in the area and many people are stuck under the remains of the town of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grande refused to leave his post in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was loudly shaken.
It remained on site to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the track at that time, will take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was about to crash.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian air navigation service provider stated that it is possible that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport it from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter got to the tree.
"We are suffering from this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the national disaster management agency declaring access limited in the cities of Dogalga, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will increase, because many victims are still under ruin and we have not had access to many of these," said the Agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The valleys with a height of up to six metres have devastated the city of Palu, on Sundays a joint funeral will take place.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
A 35 - year - old mother named Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minimarkets are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said for CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia rushes to offer help to the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo arrived in the Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to perform all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?", CNN announced.
Indonesia was rocked at the beginning of this year's earthquake in Lombok, who fought more than 550 dead.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now stated that a person is missing, after previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that a male passenger is missing from the afternoon of Saturday.
He also mentioned that he was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land on Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The United States Air Force and the United States Navy said the plane missed the runway and arrived in a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe the plane has crossed the end of the track.
U.S. Nationality Passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the river, and to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the escorts panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States naval forces said that the sailors working nearby for the renewal of a lander jumped in help, using an inflatable boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sank 30 metres below water.
According to the data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the accidents of some airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them have included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents a history of nights where a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed its proceedings with regard to the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the records on his mobile phone to lead Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, as well as his victim's, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received localization data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which was in contradiction with his earlier claims, according to Clarion Ledger.
When the data came out that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and confessed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he “lies, because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistencies was that Telllis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records indicate that they have been known for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
According to the time, the defense will begin its final complaint on Sunday.
The judge stated that the jury is expected to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way that this type of music is seen, using positive message songs.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social issues, as it initially did.
They want to return to their origins and make hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A nanny in New York sues a couple for firing her after she received a "rasist" text message
A nanny in New York mistook a couple for firing for discriminatory reasons after she had, by mistake, received a text message from her mother, in which she complained that she was “a still colored person”.
The couple denied that they were racists, claiming that she sued him for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his dissatisfaction when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, is of colour when she first appeared in 2016.
“NUUUUUUUUUU! IN A CULATION PERSON,” Pasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Maurice twice.
After he realized the gaff, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, did not fulfill her duties properly and that she was expected to receive a nanny of Filipino nationality, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple to pay compensation for dismissal and requests the amount of $350 per day for six months, the period in which she was to live with them and do her business, despite the fact that this is done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that no such thing is done," she said on Friday for the Post newspaper, adding "I know it's about discrimination."
The couple denied the claims that they were racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice, because they feared they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent him a wrong message.
She's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, her husband, for the Post newspaper.
“But did you leave your children in the hands of someone you were wrong about, even if you were wrong?
Newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process, Plasco stated that his wife will be born in two months and that she is in a “very difficult situation”.
“Do you really want to take revenge on someone under such circumstances?
Don't do that," the bank investor added.
While the process is under way, public opinion has accused the couple of socializing networks, judging them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington's stories were afraid that readers would not be able to identify with a bear that speaks, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It's very funny now, after I saw Paddington had a huge success."
It further stated that his father, who was a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the anniversary at the time of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "duce-amure" after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride about the success he later enjoyed.
"He was quite a quiet man and he didn't like to brag," she said.
“Well, because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, though it’s not yours.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give him the credit of Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye by phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was transported quickly to Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
“It doesn’t sound often to tell me it’s very serious and you don’t think it’s going to survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me he'll die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, “Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines administered by doctors for her heart to continue to pump blood was beginning to decrease and come out of her body.
She died a little while ago and the organs began to stop working.
I've been forced to sit there and wait, aware of everything that's happening.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, grieving after the death of his daughter, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what she was going through.
"He didn't know anybody," she said.
“I kept my head down and tears kept flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy with Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two grieving women place different messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place several messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them being motivational and including phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, aged 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising chef with a soft smile.
“Everyone appreciates the smile.
They always said his smile changed your disposition."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had reached a very unfortunate moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he had taken his life.
Davis said, “I keep thinking about you going to have a domino effect.”
It created the messages “to pass on to people that they can call on someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend. ”
Go outside, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies's birthday friend, lost Mark, the life partner he was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or depressed,” she said.
“Just a few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and didn't even look in their eyes."
She said that her death was a tremendous trauma to them, but she must overcome it: “It caused great pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake, as a result of the beginning of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for – an investigation over a limited period of time and of limited scope – we could have little unity,” said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that the commission is afraid to “disintegrate,” on the bottom of a partisan lock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks left until the 6 November elections - if, as expected, Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they want to win at the highest court elections in the country will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through which he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finishes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make the difference in the case of equality and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives in North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean parliamentman said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean unification ministry, said last year they fled from the country about 1,127 people, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were controls at the stricter border between North Korea and China and the higher rates perceived by those who illegally transport people across the border.
The Phenian didn't make any public comments.
In the end, a large majority of Northerners are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the war in Korea in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers fugitives more illegal than refugees and often returns forced.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still, practically, in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for a few discussions that had been the subject of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States sanctions of causing lack of progress ever since.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security and, in such situations, we won’t be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "historical", declaring he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrat minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court as "historic" and said that his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made his comments on Saturday, during an interview, at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of the fact that if she was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared “sterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s legal commission, which took place Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that he'd sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screamed and lost his voice because of the emotions, while discussing his family and the years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling them “a grotesque and coordinated assassination of character”, organised by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said it is of the opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when she was asked whether she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court in which you are now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Columbia District Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Law accessible to care or the Roe versus Wade case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question if he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect to say, “You’re great,” Pelosi said.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diarrhic, it's months and years of accumulated rage and can't talk without crying out.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “I received a significant help from a woman in an executive office, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then continue.
I thought it was a great thing."
The tears are allowed for the exteriorization of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, where I began to cry because of an inexpressible rage, is that I was stabbed by the head of an older woman, a cold director who I always felt a little afraid of, and went to the stairs house.
"You must never see yourself crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be happy that they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democrat in Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extra-husband relationship on a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason to run even her to the presidency.
“It wasn’t a very good decision, ” she says laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "White as Snow and the Seven Pictics".
Because the campaign was in the end, she was behind the fundraising and swore she wouldn't run unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given her men $1,000, they only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she asked.
During the speech when he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so touched by emotions – as a result of the gratitude for the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice because of the emotions .
“You would have said I have a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls about the media’s reactions to her.
"You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex."
I remember thinking about what they'll write on my gravestone.
"He cried?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial to Beijing?
Salves that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China were audible and, although it seems to be a long way to close it, the disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for long-term Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning at the beginning of this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
The most important escalation took place this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), actually applying taxes for half of all goods in China arriving in the United States.
Beijing took revenge every time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10% for US products worth 60 billion dollars.
China has warned that it will respond to every hit by the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays books well, the United States' trade war pressure could positively support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than what has been anticipated so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security (Center for New American Security), a group of experts.
Syria is prepared for the return of refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moulem, said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists so that things get back to normal.
Existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures facing day-to-day life and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011 when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by insurgency will not be accepted.
European Team Wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of Paris, France.
The United States has now registered the sixth consecutive win in Europe and no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came first after the team led by the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn got 14,5 points, needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Miccelson, who exerted incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit in the water to the hair 3 from the 16th hole, giving up the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari has had an incredible performance in all the stops, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since there is the current format of the tournament since 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost at the 5th and 4th holes in front of the player on the top ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, Denmark.
The first player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost at the 2 and 1 in front of Ian Poulter in England, which is probably his last game in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with the most wins, recording an average of 25.5 points in his entire career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It's a team job and I'm glad I could be of help," said Garcia, excited after the European victory.
He's handing over the flag to his Constable, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at the 2nd and 1st holes in the individual game, on Sunday.
"I'm very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to follow the games when I was a kid," Rahm said, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being only exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinary throughout the entire tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the American team said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they really did.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've gone to a cricket fight.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to give them due respect.
They played better than us."
