What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
New CSSD elected members of the capital city will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand at the level of the municipal council with their former and new ODS colleagues.
Today.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argôte that was born in recent years in the city hall, when they were the partners of the current coalition who were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream has set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Well describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new electors did not understand well known terms.
At least they say it.
Who's Valdemort?
"I really don't know."
"I'm a young man in the Pragian politics has reacted to Lukas Kaucky, the elite in the culture of the "parent" vocabulary test.
And with regard to the political veteran, the Elu Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the sense of "goal trou".
"It's the only expression you're proposing that I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the bow.
From the vocabulary, of which the newspaper Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June this year before the pre-etectoral congress of the ODS, the writing chose 6 examples, mainly those related to the city hall of Prague.
Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", going to the pastry, "nerf of beef", "the treason of the capital" and "enroll".
Three of the electors agreed for the quiz, the fourth-Antonin Weinert, which has to lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then didn't pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek refused the test.
"I don't care about all of this and how the representatives of civil democracy are having fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with the way we will understand ourselves in our programs," he said.
As already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the above legend that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the ex-Maire Roman Well.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he came into the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the White Tunnel," said Kaucky and immediately added, "But I know about the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay a language course," he joked.
Not only the killer Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the one for the environment, knowing that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social-democrats know who really is Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks about going to the pastry.
"This is, I think, going into a business," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek companies.
On the same subject, Brezina recalls that he learns his knowledge from newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no lexicon of argué in social democracy.
"I took counsel with colleagues and it turns out that we really don't have anything like that."
"The names are said to be sometimes used abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socio-Democrat Party, which the members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Brezina said about the nicknames.
Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The Weinert elected is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Old Little, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him prior to the election by the scams during the party sponsoring, is nicknamed "the little joujo".
Surnames are also the only ones who admit to using social democrats inside the party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't like to hear much of Hulda, but the newspaper Akuel.cz has registered another nickname for this Pragoian president.
"Doctor in law of matraque" it seems that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title as a doctor in law of JUDr at the bratislava police academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of the "surgery", a brochure was published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, they cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "surgery" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this destiny."
"We do not judge young women in good health because they participate in work and give birth to children," said a sister in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who were rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He edited a booklet that should help limit the witch hunt.
The case has a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," told Die Standard about the disadvantage of written education.
The sorcery charge is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, near Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprinkled on her.
The BBC server sent this information.
Criminals say it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings burned to the woman's contact.
The oil fluctuated, it seemed, when the team wanted to "get out the bad spirit" of the woman.
Isolation of "surgery" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human-spirited eaters have always been a danger," he said.
As Burkina Faso attempts to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia did not later than last year even saw the President himself participating in the hunt.
"The President of the Gambia Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a large hunt for witches who, he believed, would have participated in his death and would have struggled by the black magic to kill the President as well."
"Slamans from Guinea near the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and personal custody of the President, men and women randomly selected in the villages of Gambia," said the organization "Amnesty International in a message.
On the farm, people in prison were to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that resulted in additional effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
About a thousand people were released on international pressure.
Bakal's tenant: The chickens warm up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out of the door of the client centre of RPG Byty of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who was in the process of serving a penalty.
Deregulation has led to increased rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the wire will have to settle from next year for a second category 2+1 apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works for solid fuel", shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed it anyway" explains it in anger and half resigned.
The citizens' association of BytyOKD.cz apartments that described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to it by a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by beating his eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After New Year, this is what awaits most of the apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has for this reason decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door is a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
One pressure and one paper with an output number of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already begins to shine on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short time, an old couple arrives to learn about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to resolve common problems as everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance and other events.
In the Ostrava region, people of more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio include mails with new lease contracts in their letter boxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for about a week, so it's still under trial," he answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and former Bakal miners apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of Parliament, who originated from the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region, reported that he had been sufficiently supportive before the elections and now completed the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They haven't even changed me a whore...on board in the toilets, relieved himself in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is primarily, according to employees, pensioners who come to be sure that they will receive a return on the new price of rent if they sign now as the RPG promised in a special offer.
It is a return of half of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent," says the employee at the store.
And yet RPG stays both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on rent, the decision will be taken by an independent court.
'These are not threats, but only to inform you about the unique and legitimate way to act legally' says RPG on its website.
"Here no one will go to court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man on the street in front of the client centre is right.
"I have 13,000 retiring crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks no one to sign and so people are waiting," she said.
The rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents do not always reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in 4 billion apartments, in four years of 2011 to 2014 this is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung on the ceiling in front of the cushioned chairs of the Havirovka Street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of GDP apartments'.
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns the m2 per month," the screen says.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the GSP portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a really very low sum 19.66 Czech crowns to m2," he adds.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money of rent increase (cf. graffe) is returned to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The mother's school is also part of offices including architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that he also houses a mini mother school with all the necessary - colour walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a small playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of Arch. design can go there.
The Arch. Design project-architectonic company, whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has imagined its mini-primary school of business since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially the age of children, and it was important for women architects and project leaders to be able to quickly return to work.
At the same time as low-time employment contracts, the school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
It is Arch.Design's employees who imagined this maternal school and with the support of management, they were able to obtain a European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-maternal school is funded through the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding facilities (up to 2.8 thousand Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years they provided qualified personnel and on-the-board.
After the use of funding (two years) the Arch. Design company has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini-mother school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the Economy rating company that helped to apply for staffing.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a nursing teacher care for children. Children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are more than three years old for most.
As it is a "mini school motherhood" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more replacements.
The work of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is individual care and education, the programme of the mini-primary school is comparable to that for preschool education.
The children do not only play it but a quality education is also provided there - from the beginning to the preparation of the schools, English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and not have the stress of delay to go looking for children in a school away from the parent's workplace.
Parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer is created.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a bonus of choice for recruiting new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudí.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric sarian, the staircase to a vertical column of dinosaur and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname Maison en os.
Organic shapes, wild colours, unusual use of stones, piece of tiles and mosaic, façade recalling scales and everywhere present curves, here is all that is epic for Art Nouveau d'Antoni Gaudí.
The front façade of the house runs its dream lines, colors and pleasant textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation, we see geometry, rhythm, and precise order.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
Rolling and twisting of shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and the blades.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at the number. 43, was born of the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of old construction and the construction of another new one, but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of unusual reconstruction and better market.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house with multiple dwellings was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that decorations are born for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
Other artists and creators have also worked for the facade.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo started through successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila's house and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises nicknamed the house hot just after its finish because of its organic shapes "the House in Bear".
On the other hand, in view of the specific mechanism for opening windows, it was called the "house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the construction contain hidden religious grounds.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in his central heating time, with aerial events and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation Gaudí did not fully comply with the construction directives and did not allow themselves to be blocked by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permit to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and demanded modifications.
He did not like, for example, the members of the municipal council that the building pillars were pushing on the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call from the city Josep Battlo asked (and got satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third one bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented at a jewelery.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you can access up to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also works on the modern concept of space liaison.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the hall doors and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new facades a non-traditional roof and two floors more.
The Gaudí game with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which the interior courtyard is decorated and with light wells.
The two-coloured game gives a maximum of light on all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark which instead absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and extended the field of visits to the common areas and the barn including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a summary: Women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bed, so the mattress and the toper provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status, and the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which we will place the mattress and the top is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where the latex mattresses are not continually sleepable, because they are "heating" slowly.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilating channels in their hearts and if they remain on a solid board, they retain moisture. Measuring can also be formed.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a tearing layer, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all hockeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a raving layer of lazy foam."
"Sylva Adamczikova is also recommended for those who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore ill assumes the "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in the refilled furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have, for example, suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't go back into the night like after a hard game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against the scales.
For selecting the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, i.e. about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of 180cm, therefore, need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or at all 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singles are recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association des Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators who have been dedicated for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaching in specialized schools.
For a two-seat bed each needs his own top and mattresses, so however, during the attempt to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only climb the top to different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattress should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which it is for the shape and aeration layer at least three centimeters.
"If you touch or sit on the mattress you must not feel the springs," says Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of soaking.
The summary bed, when the mattress and the summary are united like sesame sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; we must not wash it, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night you normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to remember a big (and closed) tamis.
For this, specialists refuse to make a 25-year life claim for a mattress or life guarantee.
But all in his hands.
And for this, an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, to hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to make coatings with sliding closures for the whole, that is, after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) or handling for large models (and for one person only) becomes when you remove them a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid plank in your bed instead of a top?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the floor (if there is no) of air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with springs in bags (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress shall not be part of such a bed.
For single-season lams with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are folded in the bottom of the kidneys and so it is possible to regulate its rigidity.
For mattresses with multiple positions it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
In addition to the rigidity adjustment of the blades, you can also install what is called a shoulder strap.
This is a special link of the blades that allows pressure or tilting the blade to make the shoulder of the sleeper "integrate" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", it's really important.
This is already envisaged by the manufacturers of mattresses that for the "male" began to use a rambling zone at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they once again offer them a softer surface at the hips level.
For the most difficult customer, there are wings or platelets with what is called a multi-force suspension.
Pressure spreads to more points and diinues the tension.
But of course, as soon as you use a bad earring (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and soaking, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the ear must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the eyebrow must level (with the shoulder cradle of the top or the area rattles in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something common with the first straw and grass base.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soya.
"The Bio qualification for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender perfumes.
There are differences between men and women.
While extracting it from boleau plants so that the coating of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "refroidit" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
The current favourites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a perturbed cell structure thus more respirating than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffness of the cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached first place.
Saving for mattress and top is not simple.
From time to time, there may be special actions by manufacturers or producers of two mattresses for the price of one.
Like the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam Memory sews on the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempor material at a "cosmic" rate.
This began as a material for NASA because astronauts were subjected to the start of huge load factors.
The Tempor scrambles in the heat and, on the contrary, hardens in the cold.
He therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes it with optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against the bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
More and more people are being asked by parents who want to watch their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to look for cars, can also be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases, such as the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The small Anicka case has stirred up a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracers in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of poor use of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of someone who is not aware, but I have not yet met such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, add Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in the event of an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to carry something of this kind on him, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something explicitly when they don't want to be under control.'
"The mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long wait," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very questionable.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything to ensure that the child has no electronic device to locate it."
"Actually, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," the psychologist said.
It also recognizes that such devices can help in an attack not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, who offers tracking services for both cars and people, he says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an assault.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is on a regular basis after a given period."
"In case the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
'The most expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately indicates the position of the person who has slipped and is in an extended position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, mobile phones called intelligents who are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after they have formed it with a special prologial.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to the ones that are worn in pendant of the size of a box of lighters or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed as a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating strings that it could turn the Czech Republic with, but it can only take two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the strings is up to two to four years.
The army purchased detonating cords from the anonymous STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for a huge amount of detonating strings to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnics, MF DNES contacted, it is apparent that even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel, should have an annual exercise in explosives.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the 60 km army of detonating strings.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the military reserves could survive for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, it is enough more than 2 m of detonating strings, as experts say, that means that the army with its new purchase has also ensured - with the consumption of the special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their fist weapons and that shooting sessions were limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body linen we don't talk about.
"And I don't take my mind if they buy in us such a lot of detonating strings."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we strive to be content merchants," says STV Group Jan Decky's business director.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating strings will be seized by the army of these "munitions" for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky from STV Group reported only four years of life of the detonant cords and the police and army pyrotechnics for only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it can even go up to four years," said one of them who does not want his name to be published in light of the military's criticism.
The length of time spent, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The Department's other argument is a reduction due to the amount of 445 km of detonant strings.
"They cost us 60 per cent less than last year's supply of 245 km", says the Pejsek spokesman, who interprets the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnics that neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always command only the amount of ammunition required to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for reasons of safety of pyrotechnics and in order to obtain more flexible types of more modern and more reliable detonating strings.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, headed on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years is the Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: to neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old detonating strings that it buys today "in the cheap".
So far, I am taking advantage of contacts that I have gained through the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the best individual entrepreneur competition for last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to succeed is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec he was missing a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region gave me the desire to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvests the benefit in the building that he converts to a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his work as an entrepreneur allowed him to open 4 guesthouses in Libérec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until very recently the four star Pytloun hotel design.
This year he arrived with another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates for the free of Pytloun hotels showed up", number 1 of the entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the contest of the contractor of the year has served well, added Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known to Libérec and his surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this assistance to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he uses his contacts and knowledge so far that he could not have obtained any other way.
"With those I met through the competition I started to maintain business relations on a regular basis.
According to him, the reputation related to success has also had an impact on employees.
And it has about 70.
"I observe in them above all the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has generally been recognized."
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of good work for all of us together.
"Only my name has been pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of the victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to find the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Vodaphone Firm last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a business firm of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that the reward has not only encouraged my employees and has increased our confidence in ourselves to fight competition," said the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet society there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he was working at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's surroundings for the manufacture of plastic bath tubers.
Not long after they started specializing in vegetable oil presses.
He became the largest manufacturer of automatic press in Central Europe after eighteen years.
The company was even known in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to really know the Farmet brand but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that got the greatest success in its home country," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not go to Farmet only in the euphory of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the 2008 and 2009 economic results.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped from this situation."
"Business figures fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even firefighter," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that, from time to time, unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained recipient results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We built a training and research centre with the staffings, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky said.
Everything leaves us to think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of affidavits goes back and with them the number of employees as well.
"A new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which removes unnecessary regulations.
The year's absurdity survey is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could have been deleted.
The unglorious winner of this year's absurdity survey was the obligation to bring to the offices of documents that staff can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper excerpt from the trade register while the grievor could obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for insurance payment controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesman of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Point out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must complete in the Czech Republic and remove those which are absurd is the meaning of this year's absurdity contest.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters showed up, at least 4000 this year gave their vote.
And it's not surprising, there are the most diverse legal obligations in our country that only put a stop to the company, and, more and more and more.
"We may be in the number of documents to be completed for tax returns in the first places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a popular goal for all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the world bank, the Czech Republic is 74th place for business conditions, i.e. 8 more places than last year.
The year's absurdity competition was first established in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report each year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April at the end of September, last time before the closing of the competition.
To report on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and lets the public vote during October on www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity which has received the largest number of votes is declared a winner.
Until last year's survey, it was a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
The "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees, is the requirement that highway and fast-track maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, repeat two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always starts in early November on Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of a meeting that regularly participates in political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
'Economic prosperity can't work when the state puts thongs in the legs of entrepreneurs and for that reason my goal is to delete, every year, at least three tens of paragraphs that today only complicate the business," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd credits is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what did not appeal to people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before the office for the individual company to the place where the company was located, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007 to report to the Office of Labour a service trip for a 30-day foreign employee was deleted with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the competition.
The 2009 Absurdity was the order for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by the Ministry of Health's order last year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year of Hospodarske Noviny's competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Firm Head of the Year 2010.
The target of this competition is support for the fair and reasonable business.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and carry out socially responsible activities," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the Vodaphone firm, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 Vodaphone firm's competition, companies that do not have success with a single long-term goal for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the object of their business is different, one may consider their support and forecasting activity as the denominator of their efforts.
This applies to persons with disabilities and to personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the entire Czech Republic, there is no example of the Pragian and Netera software company that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of the firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company that has been the main contributor to the staffing fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
In order to deal with employees with health problems, it is also possible to mention the old Podbrad paper manufacturing plant that employs more than 70 per cent of them and has, for this reason, obtained the title of the firm Head for the Central Bohemian Region and which has placed third in the region in the competition of the Vodaphone Firm.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has won for the introduction of flexible working hours and even reduced to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, a reduction in wages.
The jury also gave him the title because it gives priority to Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyenne activity in the near environment and cares about the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible for our business activity and our administration to have the least impact on the environment," says Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of society.
the company responsible for IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their home work and uses the catering services of a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At the very least, for its activities, there is also a Lavage and Cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, increased qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the construction society of bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the Corporate category Responsible, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Firm competition, who had responded to the accompanying questionnaires of the registration document and returned it to the organizer before 15 August.
The answers to the questionnaire were not completed or incomplete from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in high school had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm Responsible but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition of the Vodaphone Year.
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the firm of the year," says Karel Goldman of the organization agency Bison&Rose.
In the Land Fund in Plzen, the police arrested during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been arrested in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local entrepreneur and were trading on the property of Lubos. G.
The latter had endeavoured to handle just a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the proposed land is obtained by a specific candidate.
The one was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For now I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for a crime of initiation in the context of a call for tenders and a public competition," said Pravo, the leader of Plzen's Park Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations as the investigation is under way.
After 24 hours, the police released this 46-year-old contractor.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, we can only speculate about so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund said that the police had actually arrested Plzen at a separate workplace, and that was during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no case did an employee, she specified.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call for Land Transfer Rights under the Land Act" and is put in place when several legal candidates appear.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their reciting rights that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of buyers is put in place and the Terrain Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," said the Spokesperson of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, of course, the information concerning the persons who had entered the appeal and as he himself is also a recipient because having purchased a large number of refund entitlements, he had offered candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably in danger of withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his inquiry.
Lubos G. had contacts largely above the FdT (Land Fund) standards.
It was in the case of the former chief of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the decision to establish a construction had already been published.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, in place and place where access to the industrial area of Borske Pole had to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the mayorate for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it could jeopardize construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of one hundred crowns per month for housing.
As of January, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to draw from their purse up to a hundred crowns a month more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should accommodate households in the apartment of the 100 crowns annually more than at present.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the significant development to encourage renewable energy production, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas is increasing moderately, but of course, at a time when people need the most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count an additional hundred crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the people of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent is being prepared for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If rents do not change the pragmats they will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be one of the lowest in comparison to the whole country.
In northern Bohemian, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty company that owns Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
Regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk at rum and Fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
They are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet 15 years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of the hospitals' children's departments.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be healthy."
'The trend is really strong alcohols," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department at Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemian.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of papa in the cabinet, it's sometimes wisky but it's the fenet and vodka that prevails."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus do not feel it," says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokesman for the Motol hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or Fernet."
"It is today alcohol in fashion especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought home," said Jurinova.
According to the head of the Pelikan department, seeing drunk children aged thirteen to fourteen years of admission to the hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol, where he spent ten years just in pediatrics where the ambulances brought schoolers from the wide areas completely ivres.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times.
"She started her career at twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood with a mix of ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was in the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinteresting of parents or their tolerance out of the ordinary in view of the fact that their rejections give themselves to the drink that is the main cause of the development of the alcoholism of children.
According to the experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
"Besides the so-called alcoholic is a chronic dependence on alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that derive from it but that we do not find in children."
"In those who use repeated alcohol, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," said Chief of Department Pelikan.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, approximately forty ivres children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
They are only integrated into statistics with a serious intoxication requiring hospitalization.
Ivy children who are after emergency care returned to their homes by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, he exists according to Pelikan three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of the witches, the Holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"They either drink in spite of bad results or they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course I lived on the day of the witches a single admission of 7 drunk children," Pélikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in disengagement under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffered the day after the "wood mouth".
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are for this better lotis as they spend an excellent evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurt them."
"They are only surprised at where they are," adds Pelikan knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients with the note to be paid for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care beds can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting these children how much their drink cost and they could spend the whole summer working seasonally to pay back one evening," Pélikan added.
However, he believed that health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover care-related burdens from parents, did not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport planes, took off on Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer sits.
This is the first time that such devices become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the course of exercises or demonstration thefts.
These are the two-way versions of the L-159T1 that were up to now in service in the Czech army and were in a state of flight.
The remaining three devices are single-place versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence's press department, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is currently unknown.
The L-159 single-place aircraft for the exchange have been taken on long-awaited aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 biplaces were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He argued that the army would not remain a bi-placed, since the department signed an agreement with Aéro Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four L-159 single spaces that were not used in two two spaces.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, he has committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of certain Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the one taking into account the L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will be used for the training of pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the person who takes into account how to accomplish this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army was not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched an invitation to tender and has contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export from L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft in Aéro Vodochody and only used 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will likely have legal implications.
However, the European Commission filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice as the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European call for tenders and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely Airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men with a longer index than the ring are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of hormone male testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple risk test for prostate cancer, especially for men before 60 years of age," the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University, proclaimed.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo the prostate cancer test, including by combining the genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the lower right hand index than the annular.
For them and for the 19 percent of those with the same length fingers, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
However, in the case of those who had the longer index than the annular the risk fell to 33 percent, for men before 60 years of age, the risk decreased to 87 percent.
The length report of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular the different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is just testosterone that helps the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is in the snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czechia as most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time of compact snow, the sinks have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93rd kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno towards Prague is the same fate.
The Central Auto club dispatcher (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st kilometre, a truck was injured, and at the 93th heavy weights were struck, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also found themselves in the gap.
The problems are also on Highway D1 at 185 km to Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers are expected to leave right after Brno at the 190th km or go to Brno and then enter the 182nd km to Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several kilometers formed in this place.
Also on Highway D11, there's an accident and, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters of thickness, the thermometers indicate -7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines, for example, are created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Tramways take a delay, for example, on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, Prague's state of crisis must meet again.
Railways and the airport also face problems.
Czech railways have already had to eliminate because of snow 7 quick links.
Lines such as Prague in Kralupy or Prague in Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 p.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but redoubled by vigilance.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impractical, on the Brno road it begins to be around snowflakes and on the Blansko road the lines are required to pass some communications routes in the above places.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
Up to now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
In order to clean them, it may be necessary to send snowwater and fresheners.
We can't estimate when they're rolling.
On the route of Hodonin prudence is harsh in the white Carpathians region.
On the roads that are, in view of the protection of nature, maintained only by the sprinkling of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow averted CTK.
In Czechia, it fell between two and 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in Northern Bohemian, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snowing was gradually disappearing in Czechia.
Americans have a new "intelligent weapon"
The U.S. Army sent to Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and will "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super accurate cannon
Its projectiles are driven by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm-calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, works in fact as small grenades.
Ammunitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
So you can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall, or a gap.
Nor is it protected from above and when it falls upon a deadly rain of steel bursts, it can also put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it primarily in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, gets a specific target point, according to which he corrects his target site and supports the relaxation.
"Say you've targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the relaxation, the weapon loads and shoots at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters, Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu group relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees are moving to Astro Park to their current workplace at the Place Mareinbader office building in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese band Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the giant specialized in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader Square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should bring together 100 other jobs still spread to the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive. Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankurt-Niederrad is for us a prime location with remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that connection to the airport is just of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region yesterday brought the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith related to the place of establishment".
Fujitsu suits the city and its implementation is an important momentum for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulty of the computer manufacturer faced with the owner of the property of Place Marienbader.
Finally, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding that an exceptional place remains unattended for a long time.
"I hope the owner and dancer of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the property of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the neighbouring "small vertical" company, as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, was part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance of the city was created between the station and the City Hotel. It raises many criticisms, not only because of the impressive design of the surfaces that once used to be part of the parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment rating and advice company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Group of Frankfurt Specialists Immobilien-Cancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu along with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund. One year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group, located in Tokyo, sees itself as the world's third largest supplier of IT products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to companies and also provides essential service.
His branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have taken for rent in the Astro Park building.
This old 20-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, is home to, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet service provider has removed from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressure from publications of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently stayed in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is attacked with increasing force.
The group of cyber activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted until now in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called the other countries and boycotting companies Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom" indicated on Wednesday (local time) cyber-activists at the origin of revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber enterprise, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the issuance of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
CNN's TV channel, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's employees.
The president of the Senate Committee on the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I wish Amazon would have taken this action earlier in view of the previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the honourable senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, and in doing so, it puts our national security at risk and endangers life all over the world," according to an independent senator's statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people sought by Interpol.
According to information provided by the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions brought against him by Sweden.
The spokesperson for Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats have been reported against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for Julian Assange's murder."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about her safety, Hrafnsson said.
That is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
He was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that those responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Chief of Government advisor Stephen Harper stated on television that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy erupted between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for the US President, Barack Obama, has described as "dignified and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in spying activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of an individual who owns a website," said Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government now completely passes to the test bench the protection of its databases.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for the fight against leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "the necessary structural reforms" made essential after disclosure of the diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the desire to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects the information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to deal with the security of dissidents and activists so that they were ever threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the spokesman for the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
University of Glace
At the "Gelato" University of Bologna, ice confectioners are being prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does the whole ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German, the somewhat outdated ice confectioner, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cannot avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian company Carpigiani.
The sorbetières manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 so that ice creams coming out of its machines are everywhere in response to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extended over several days. Also, practical sessions are held in the private glacier.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their burning desire for smooth ice.
This time, there were 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of artistic education from California is proud of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a quality European product in the industrial ice country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business manager and, after a few years, she wants to draw some peculiarities from this trying profession for nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children loved Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is decisive not only the good taste, but also the silky flexibility and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, generally, of the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer that heats all 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cooled to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: in order to produce a pasteurized base white cream, based on all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is quickly examined by questions: Is it possible to make ice by using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free instruction to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr Luciano warned against the fact that he was misled by the spirit of time.
He who only speaks of "manufactured from natural ingredients" ice, may have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, such as guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will scratch nothing but ice granules.
Some modifications to the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano sets the difference between the ingredients acquired in the fruit ray or confisries of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to refile you dozens of aromatized ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
In sorbet recipes with fresh sugar and fresh fruit.
Both in the ice creams manufactured from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when added to cocoa powder, the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four types of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and noisette with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The hazelnut ice does not necessarily include the taste of the nut, when it is composed largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly marks the taste of an ice," says Luciano.
Icemaking is a calculation exercise: if we use the peach powder with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar should be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (the vines use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
The production of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as it used to be.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it unkempt and brought to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, small panels are not excluded.
Brazil's Gustavo shaves off the fruit of the head at his feet and thus crushes his fellow students when the control of the colossal bowl blender escapes him.
Master Luciano believes that such an "incident might occur in each course: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experimented with the culture of genetically modified plants has drowned the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now formulated by the group of experts Testbiotech who is considered to be an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Munich M. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in working out the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements developed correspond in detail to the position taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the trade mark which would, in substance, be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking member of the Efsa recently joined the Swiss food agri-food group Syngenta without a condition or a transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the control authority of the European Union and the industrial lobby, which has awakened both the suspicions of the German Federal Environment Agency and of European MPs.
However, Ephesus does not admit any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Ephsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This body considers itself to be a neutral forum for experts who, among other things, belong to science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding test in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know, for example, what the effects of genetically modified corn are on the field," said Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plants, which does not allow reliable results.
"If we don't look for risks, how can we find them?" asked Mr. Then about your accuser.
That's also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region and in the United States, and now in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are only a few other researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "industry controls security research."
The stone track
Uli Gsell has taken care of it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was evidence.
He was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators came and began to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Several thousand people have shown against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into a underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the cessation of construction work.
Dipped in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender and coarse paved badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He's been looking for a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest, cheap, simple and terrestrial rock."
He claimed that in cutting it to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he's going to do with this fragment.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
the traces of the Stones of Stuttgart lead to a former deposit of French army munitions in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is selling old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were defeated or disappeared in the landfill," he said in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He explained that he was the subject of insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But he negotiated for full days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently carried one of the approximately 80 kilogram stone umbrellas, of which the value is between 6,50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memorial at all times while also hoping to be able to make it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of them are still stuck in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscaped gardeners, Particuliers.
They came from all over the place and took everything they could into the safe and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of grass strips.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"in the summer this political component."
He enters his car all over the land, he spins his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did law studies that he had abandoned, and later he began studying biology before he became interested in computer science and finally became a career.
And a stone lover.
The stock is 40000 tons.
He grew treasure all over Germany.
He claims he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's coming back.
Sand stones carved with art are laid on the snow.
They were also part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
It takes the path that climbs through the forest.
It shows a bag of finger: Red sandstone, previously, part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Joli traverten."
The parallelepiped was once part of the gallery of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of the stones and stories, Cannstatt's travertine from the police prefecture, red granite from the St. Blasien Cathedral, the tuf from Heilbronn Hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that the stones were carved by hand and moved using simple sticks and scissors drawn by cattle, he became quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put in place."
He hasn't become rich, even less expensive.
But today this career employs 14 people. In addition, stone-cutters, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's gratifying," says the waste recycling company.
He's going to Cologne.
There too, there are stones to save.
Battle for talent to conquer high potentials
The counter knows a great deal.
16 students search to buy small salmon breads, tomato sauce and white-mangers.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Volkswagen Automobile Manufacturer invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
In the context of a kind of contest of ideas, they need to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to identify better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruiting the most skilled graduates as far as possible in amphitheatres before they arrive on the job market and are not brokered by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about their students' performances, they try to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group loves talents.
A young lady of the staff service shares the pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs to young talent; she shows them the ways to access the group's entrance.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project committed with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industry and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who enter online as a collaborator."
According to Mr Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive with which we try to attract the students.
"In other words, the focus was rather on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much worse.
In sector goods, companies can no longer recruit their employees by doing a sorting on a kyrill of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and, above all, cut the highly qualified workforce.
They are mainly Graduates from engineering courses that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unattended in October.
And according to the forecast of the IV, the vacuum on the engineering posts will be further expanded.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting expertise and counseling.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of rally-paper where competitors need to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so that they can travel in this way to the United States.
Participants can visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who is to participate in it shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream cream of the many candidates will fly for the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used to search for high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little of a thing"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have been in contact with all those who have taken part last year in similar action."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct ambiance carried out on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises perform in a very classical way by participating in the professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We're trying to reach graduates by participating in professional salons."
"For example, at the Solar Technology Fair," said Ms. Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturing photovoltaic panels.
This company in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 posts are being held at the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacant positions."
"It costs and takes a lot of time," do you know?
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with different higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional internships or to write his final study project at our home."
Low-cost advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"A large group often can't do that," said Mrs. Stübe, Chief of Staff.
A long time ago, money no longer played a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the High Place to Work Institute, Solarworld has 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual table of honour for German employers.
To this end, he asked the employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and their context while looking at the employee framework conditions.
The Chief of Staff, Mrs Stübe, hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image with job seekers.
"I believe that candidates are focused on external assessments of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies that wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, that means first of all taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own strength.
"the collaborators satisfied form the best messengers."
When they deal well with their employees and identify with the company, they only advertise their employer to their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, Southeastern United States, in the coming years.
The Washington Government has imposed a ban on an equivalent ban and thus finally annulled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains banned for the time being.
The secretary to Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that is the origin of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this life-saving accident to eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries on oil supply.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastatement of the black tide in golf is not, until now, definitively resolved.
The British Petroleum Group, which is facing multi-billion claims for compensation, is at the centre of the charges.
An investigation commission established by Obama must present its current conclusions in December.
In October, the secretary to Interior Ken Salazar lifted the freeze from the forage decreed after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter safety instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing thorough reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that they would remove the lucrative tax niches from gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than has been so far.
"The aim of the government is to put a stop to rapid growth in the gas and oil sector" as a result of a current survey carried out in the sector by the BDO audit firm prior to the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to new order at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is oiled brown; it exhibits a smell similar to that in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of gallons of crude oil destroyed the country Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live in flight, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't get exhausted," the environmental activist throws the journalists to calm them: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to photograph a young man who has fallen into the muddy water to his chest, as well as the bold sledge around him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the stream of water in the colour of the rainbow.
It is hard to see that the basement is full of brown crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom reported that she was collecting shrimps by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have been completely dry.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil fell from an oil pipeline that exploded in the vast tide.
Fishermen live in the small neighbouring town of Bodo now have to come back for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The country Ogoni located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the ravages leaps into the eyes as the mangrove marshes pass through watercourses.
Instead of clear water, the motor boat finds a crading brown water. Anyone who dives its hand removes it completely covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the soil as well as gliding sticks. The isolated palm trees leave sadly hanging their palms.
We are looking for bird nude in vain, as we usually meet in wetlands: As long as the off-board engine stops, a fantastic silence unfolds over this once-like paradise that looks like a service station by the smell it releases.
"What is happening here is war against the environment," said Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battle field that has been in place for tens of years: over 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was later executed. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous to its employees.
Today still, the return to Ogoni is forbidden to this society: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to over 5000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the Ogoni oil fields are unexploded because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred metres walk into the water of steel truffles as bizarre sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are rubbed by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature will break from time to time into pieces, as a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion liters have been poured into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which has flowed into the sea during the accident of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution?The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and syphoning of the pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider the explosions of the drilling heads and the oil pipelines perforated as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner criticized the Shell group for applying security standards to Nigeria that are essentially less stringent than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of conduct is "a lot higher than allures".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of camouflage and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with camouflage up to the neck.
A spark fire under one of the many tonnes that is sometimes linked to pipes, sometimes spread without reason on the site, must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
We've been heating crude oil in the ton for several hours, Michael, the team leader.
In the first instance, the gasoline penetrates into a container by passing pipes, then at the end of the kerosene drop drive and finally getting diesel.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators daily produce four 300-liter Diesel drums: "It accounts for 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta people are taking advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price less than that ridiculously low of 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: Because they bought their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the network of oil pipelines in perce throughout the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small portion of the provisionally stored raw material is unlawfully purified: Organized crime networks that also include members of high-ranking politicians and military personnel, load the lion's share in tankers and dominate the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on the question of whether to attribute the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the mode of secular production is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the fishermen's life were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no illegal theft and refineries."
But in the meantime, the relations of the Ogoni, especially with Shell, have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of withdrawing the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will be better off."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a great time that you're deguering" announces the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers may appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at the most they will offer them wine pots.
Even the soldiers mostly from the north of the country want to enjoy like all Nigerians of raw material.
"In any case, this piece of shit has dropped our country very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
When examining an aircraft that carried out an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "a catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas were visibly more likely: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of certain A380 devices presented a serious security problem, and it warns against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could result in serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks at the oil pipeline connection level, it is indicated in a position published this Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to "a catastrophic failure of reactors".
The reactors made of Rolls-Royce and 20 aircraft in the A380 series are concerned.
The Airbus of the Quantas company, which had to land as a matter of urgency on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now filed judicial proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against society.
The Director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damages in respect of the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the ignition of oil that causes damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that other safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with question reactors.
Safety recommendations are the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesperson for ASTB, Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all the parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the Quantas airline had immobilized its entire fleet of A380 for a week on the ground.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
The Lufthansa company replaced the reactor of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The two-storey plane is the world's largest liner.
Snowfall across the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, the snow fell on almost all the country.
The chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
In the winter, Germany is scrambled: By glacial temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many places.
North and east, snow cover is 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is heavily restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to reach the end of the snow that had ceased to accumulate.
In addition, violent bursts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) is expected to take place above the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowmas on highways and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the weather alert Meteomedia announced the level of purple alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
By places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxon-Anhalt land, police authorities have announced serious road disturbances.
On Highway A2, snow and wind caused a disruption of traffic and caused stoppers.
In Thuringe, snowfalls affected motorways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious railway traffic disturbances occurred in Saxony, Saxony, Thuringe and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: the snow on the railways, the trees falling on the railroads, the catinars or the needles destroyed.
In Saxony, the interregional transport of Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt his trip.
The firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers of the train in blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds have swept the roads.
The snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at Germany's major airports.
According to a standard spokesman and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers who are stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, even though only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a ton on a sliding chair in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and dusty, but it will torbillonn in the case of light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be struck by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her twin tours.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's seat: The twin towers in the Business Quarter have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
In the past, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper writes, citing a spokesman.
This spokesperson did not state the reasons for the intended sale.
He said, "We'll check if it's more interesting to take care of the buildings or to sell them, and to put them back in place later."
Thus, the largest financial institution in Germany has already surrendered its headquarters, shortly thereafter.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of EUR 272 million from its own funds holders, and then they were rehabilitated.
The changes to energy optimization have included, according to some indications, approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, the experts in this business sector estimate the value of the tours, renamed in the meantime "Green Curtains", to around 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not known at present whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for buried minors who were reported dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to go back to the bodies because the security situation of the sinister well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinister well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no relief team could go down to the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that the minors were no longer able to survive.
So far the bodies could not be moved back.
Today, parents and friends have organized a memorial celebration of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 enveloped minors, we installed 29 tables on which we could see the names, helmets and lamps.
The personal photos and effects, including the clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags have been put in the air in front of all the public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative festival that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that minors will return to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said that he cannot refuse to accept the death of his son until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Police prefect Gary Knowles told journalists that when explosive gas masses are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Sprinter movie an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
To what audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think well by turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye taken prisoner; he frees himself from his bourbon and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents after each other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When he is in bad mood, he pulls out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the burgundy said no words on its real name. Even other characters let escape, at the most, from one or two sentences a few shrieks of terrible agony.
Otherwise, they say nothing and feast in Scotland's incredibly beautiful mountain landscape, which is the setting of the Vikings universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travels.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a shame that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy related to the drug dealer Farouche and full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and testing cinema.
Most art filmmakers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and into the intestines.
Lovers of action films die of boredom, when the burgundy embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to shut down.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" found no film distributor in Germany and that there is only one DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of poverty that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a touching film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is ambition, a fief dream transformed into a film.
The spectator can't escape it.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a lugrous soundtrack, but especially with an inexhaustible hatred that tears out of the heart of characters.
Only a blond boy, who faithfully stands by the burgundy, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything else, the burgundy hero whose furniture is never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally from allies by becoming a warrior, may be sent by the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, nothing for those who are, in any way, rotting.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims to agitate, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious terrace work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications concerning a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take any position on this subject, even less subject to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the euphrate; the largest city near is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is contained in IAEA documents, as it is the matter of the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelpiped, concealed in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing on U.S. intelligence services, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, El-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would enable the manufacture of atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each reactor component prior to the destruction of the plant that represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is hardly more information than at the time, and even in time, the mystery has become thicker.
Former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at El-Kibar, but had little evidence showing that country developed "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only talk about a "presumed reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation to be "opusable".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as IAEA.
Asked how he made sure he dealt with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic reply in the summer, claiming that IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly hastily removed the debris from the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical land planning.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in El-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, IAEA has received from a Member State the satellite images of commercial providers showing the moment that followed the attack directly. It seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for IAEA to set their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not constructed a reactor.
Damascus argues that uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But IAEA has rejected this argument after analysis of particles by calling it unattainable.
Since then, ladies have refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refuse access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister-in-Office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
This is how the investigation into this case has been carried out in length since June 2008 without a result and that it "is increasingly becoming a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a senior Western diplomat in service at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately this is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other installations that must have "functional" relationships with the alleged reactor.
Up to now, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities it is here, what their function is or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known in the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as the neighbouring cities.
Washington's Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for International Science and Security) identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians doubt that the inspection group is actually spies that would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by the US secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone umbrella to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one facility could "use fuel production".
There would be "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
However, there are serious plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come and where plutonium required for the manufacture of the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known if the engravings, which could hide high-value traces, were stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of trucks loaded with land have disappeared, no one will have information on the storage site of the engravings.
For IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine examined in 1998, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria has undertaken landfill work at the three suspected and displaced sites of huge containers when IAEA begins to demand access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but this did not help to rule out suspicions.
It was said in the diplomatic media that IAEA spent several months in developing a plan on inspections to be carried out there, which would allow Syria to keep any military secrets, and only time spent shows how much interest the inspectors have in this matter.
In the meantime, Damascus has also belittled this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the reactor's destruction, the emergency would not be reported for this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who has been referring to special inspections for a few months, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to carry out its controls.
The Director of IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open for the future", but he still hesitates.
This means an enormous risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and a large number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation become apparent.
on the other hand, as this diplomat suggests: "That would be useful, if at the end they find nothing"
Love in Wartime
It's bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in summer as a director.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but that's enough to cause the malaise.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serb ass during the war in Yugoslavia.
The federations of Bosnian women immediately protested. In response, some shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still taking place in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hassecic of the organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is a goodwill ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she has already proposed to these women to have a meeting with them in Hungary, but these women have declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says a lot about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that the Hasecic organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for the removal of the good-will ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of Jolie scenario did she write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted after a few hesitations a shooting authorization to Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not then come despite this authorization.
The young author herself ensures that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that she has made a great effort to learn about the Yugoslav conflict, and she argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and to give all stakeholders an opportunity to express herself.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew themselves well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
What still makes a big difference with the version "a victim of rape is in love with his ass."
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, as Jolie expresses herself, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario in the Net, as well as many others before.
Shoot us!
Tonight, everything goes well again with the Irish.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overpowers visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans cry for joy at the bottom of a loud music, they tread their feet.

Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the tragic question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"But I feel a strange feeling," he says.
"The home country is so far away and I have no employment."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she found her desired job as an evental project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their chance abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now holds a computer consultant position in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicated that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 migrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are made, it will be a current of emigration comparable to the one Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed great ease, grief now takes all the place.
However, the economic crisis is particularly affecting well-trained Irish youth, who have known only moments of happiness so far.
Loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes well the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes to the drift."
"There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the possibilities, is leaving and our country so a whole generation."
"The last to leave extinguish the light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, points to a darker future because the government only throws dust in the eyes and offers no future for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades cramp from one practical internship not paid to another.
She states that it is her greatest concern to emigrate within four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to positively address this theme.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" show which offers full support on the theme "Work abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not an obstacle, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing else to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just came out of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his native country, as he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to pay back the credit he has contracted to build his home in the home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't live practically anymore."
He bursts out of a restless laugh through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of big brands are stationed on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 38,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
"These were times of madness, no doubt the money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything go down because of credit?
O'Donovan reflects a moment, tightens hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to entertain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The engineer of the building does not like the complaints he has heard in recent times.
"No one must suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," he said.
"Working for a moment abroad is not what can get worse, maybe that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"It was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and find out how life is going on elsewhere.
In his handkerchief, he already has a few years of work in London. That's why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that concerns him well in recent days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's worried she can't turn into a farewell night.
"Only not a lot of emotions," he says by drinking a long glass of beer.
"Adieu, it seems quite worrying."
"Let's call it a good-bye evening, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does the private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it follows the changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey in September and early October.
The first is the fairly sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its major institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy improved after a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, thus reducing the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way their country's democracy worked in practice, with the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Graph 3).
Some 34 per cent said they trusted in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a significant increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17 per cent and 24 per cent).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook the support for democracy.
If this has been successful during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have experienced only a brief recession and have benefited from a large recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin American people living in poverty had only slightly increased in 2009 and declined again this year to 32 per cent.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performances and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
About 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is decreasing compared to 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest provider in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down by 11% last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by the respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country in distress and plunge into fear.
Voting boxes and new ballot boxes, ballot papers scattered in the tastes, sacked polling offices and intimidations were presented
The polling stations would open late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, would go to the vicinity to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually quit.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community prudently stated that they did not "think that these irregularities, as serious as they were, necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are accountable to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second expected round is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, an old first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no perceptible support for voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tour.
With an outbreak of cholera that rages, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake who still live in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In the event, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of the feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, received a wave of sympathy from the public, which has improved its approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; it has been its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term during an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, apparently in mourning, according to which she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income on will.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation overwhelmed the disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart crisis on October 27th.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist Movement in power have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian hit one of his peers and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, leaving the President even more room for manoeuvre to spend on will.
The economy is largely overheated: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and wage claims of trade unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which had forged official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now change these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded growth rate following a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government entered into an agreement with the obligors who had refused a prior forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards a favor with creditors governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it is worth $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted on the fact that this could not involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which is like a prelude to the consolidation of INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer on her side.
If she does, she needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerism is highly recommended.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in Mars, the wave of sympathy for her will have flowed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to reject her husband’s many policies without any noise.
A Half-Hour for China
Taiwanese voters are heading towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of her big brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million electors were present on November 27, 70 per cent of eligible persons, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma became a substitute for feelings over the continent, having developed innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the greatest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma did the test, but just.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayorates, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which focused on Taiwan's full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr Ma would have been in difficulty.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote had dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including tapping country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls who danced in minimal clothing.
An attempt at mandatory mysterious murder was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from sharpening the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, claimed a confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing Government will continue to provide trade facilities, in accordance with its strategy to rescind Taiwan, back to the ground.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start with the beginning.
Better wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP was reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, he was ill: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison following charges of corruption.
He was a challenger for explicit independence from 2000 to 2008.
But a new generation of moderates has been under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is doing everything they can to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP candidate in the Chair, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
They are doing their best to show that they can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a focal point between DPP and China, provided that their interviews could be conducted without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's precipitated approach to China.
Mr Chen seems to be exaggerated by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic one, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have difficulty in choosing between its potential candidates.
KMT must introspect itself.
Mr. Ma's evaluations were weak; despite a vertigious economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.
A spokesperson from the KMT says that his cabinet and his local antennas will be restored.
The successful results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for reconciliation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards Nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a selected surprise in the category "Best New Artist"
To do so at the request of a president, and people are required to become aware of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer picked up by President Obama at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a large appointment in the category "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album "Esperanza", the appointment remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist does not have to exit more than three albums before recording; this "sets the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skilled hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one pointed line in Spalding compared to the brilliant success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
In addition, Grammy Awards voters have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "tool album" category, a twist on a refreshing frisson of a recording that was one of the prime favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by the veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positotly" by the keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition in particular.
Trombone Shorty, who favors the raucous voice of New Orleans and frequent guest to HBO's "Treme", was honored in the category of contemporary jazz; which is also strongly leaning towards a certain fusion with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-deserved awards in the great category; in competition with the rich camera-jazz of Billy Children Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as group leader.
Grammy Awards Nomination: Michael Daughterty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic appointments for the 53rd Grammy Awards each year include a mix of landscaped musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the appointments, we quote "God Ex Machina" by Michael Daughty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony #4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
The classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of the Concergebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - l'art des Castati" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of the opera, the nominees are "Lulu" of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choeur of Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition count Pärt for Symphony #4, Daughterty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had its first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a recorded execution by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was appointed for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he soon wrote the work of 15 minutes especially for the performer at the Avi Avital Mandoline, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor, Pierre Boulez, received an appointment in the category of orchestra benefits, for having led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who have been appointed, we refer to the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organizer Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalists-solists nominees; here are Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for his registration "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque Project is approved by the Planning Committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics took the initiative by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the Commissioners held on Wednesday evening that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice takes it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people pronouncing for or against the centre, at speech time approximately equally distributed, according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate continued on the journal's website.
"There is no more America," wrote one speaker.
"It's another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also protested in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, where the attacks of 11 September 2001 took place in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmush denounced the violence in Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 co-existed families in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a space greater and better than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943 square feet mosque in the Mediterranean style architecture would consist of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4,32 hectares site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral lycée.
Opponents may still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why she's very special, even though she's far from being a truly "foreign" way of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of State of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have found that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing the phosphorus with the arsenic.
"We are wondering what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond the Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other global environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we think is absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Global and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felicia Wolfe-Simon of NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"The arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is quite different so it doesn't work exactly like the phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with the arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of arsenic life can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenic is most frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that the arsenic might be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of Earth's existence, she said; thus, researchers have assumed that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not only the way life on Earth was formed at first," Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institute.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two exposure dogs on four flights outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of Los Angeles County announced him Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akatas and two pembroke gallois corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they spent the night outside a Bellflower motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore told the spokesman of the department of the sheriff of Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that the dogs are doing well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say precisely where the dogs had been found, what neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be attached to provide a comment Thursday.
They were brought together on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a pet shelter in Downey County.
The sheriff's deputies found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female, were healthy and safe, announced to the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were gone until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National "AKC/Eukauuba" championship in Long Beach, where they were planning to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other events planned in the days prior to the exhibition "AKC/Eukauba," Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a boxer dog, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaghetti - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, in thicker fur, in the van where it would be fresher.
They've opened the windows a bit so the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the flight from the van at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said they'd give a reward to anyone who could drive them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward has been awarded Thursday.
The lion is ready to roar again, the restructuring of MGM no longer awaits the final green fire of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start back to zero.
A federal court of New York bankruptcies officially rented the "pre-packaged" plan on Thursday by creditors that approximately $5 billion of the debt would be cleared; opening the way to the entertainment business, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With the decision of Thursday, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no further legal obstacles remain before MGM to fly under the supervision of founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be a slight study.
The staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a credit facility of $500 million, planned to finance MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio restructuring process began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was engaged to advise management on how to place its finances, as it did not have the means to pay interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company on sale.
However, auction sales attracted few bidders among which none of them were willing to pay the 2 billion more of which the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done while the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially quit bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollars premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already earned $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have collected $375,000 per month for their company's management services, will receive a "primary of success" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum intend to relaunch the production of MGM, which only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must make a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which Peter Jackson has to make.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget balanced
Although this year's biggest toy candidate is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jumpstrings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget balanced.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholeale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technology toy is likely to have more strength; while at the same price or a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button stack toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable stack toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise specified.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are toys in wig size of an Indian pig who sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine song to dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel locking.
Children who have missed the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80's, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a back bag filled with questionnaire playing cards designed to turn a ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve classifier.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3-8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for 3-12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No versions are compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes-type system to offer games and e-books and is equipped with a SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 $, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of just five blocks larger than a box of light, each having its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impimptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a sort of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys stores, the two largest are Webkins and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 years) that includes a marked piece of a hidden code.
When you purchase the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly bigger than the hair after your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the last micro-robots to stack button.
The false beastiole moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a drop in the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to the maintenance of order in China
Tang Shenbin was depicting a place in the city as an urban trainer in training by severely inspecting his nerve loads, voiced commands with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chegguan - impotent leaders of public order in China, fearful and despised for their arbitrary repression and pensing them for violence - to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"You're right!"
"Be lazy!"
Show them, he says, "what do the pretty girls look like?"
Four girls who had barely spent their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical jackets and pants of olive color, were looking at your guard.
Four pairs of black to heel shoes, in line with the rule.
Four hats perfectly cleaned perched to the top of hair attached by a scratched knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong exchanged the grey-green uniforms against a more engaging so-called blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced them with the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had circled an uncontrollable snack trolley by launching black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the carrier packed his cases and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to perform a major image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas of 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, galbe and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulties to draw attention to this underground urban brigade in China
And for that reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media are drawing news from a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in the province of Hubei beat an observer to death after using his mobile phone to film them while spreading a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing, unearthed and online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastry collector was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game impregnated with violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained as street vendors.
"Chenguan has marked the government," said China Daily last year, a national publication, after an all-out controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real complete cleaning."
The skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or whether they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates between 18 and 22 years of age to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They must have a size greater than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
The officers stated that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It is their image that is important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they agree; this is the size, weight, facial traits, etc."
Then comes the storm and the "internal qualities."
The women of Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement regarding the order of the facial features.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or with disabilities should not apply.
"We can't let a person who box or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has apple toys with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be gender-based, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a messy air.
Xu Yang, her colleague at the 21st year of age, said, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to their limited mandate, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into streets where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen walkers who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as little bread or tofu bags as possible before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We have already told you many times!" said Ms. Xu, while a vendor ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-carlet to noodles.
Officers describe their functions as monotonous rather than hard.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that women's agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the spread of false rumors that the Chevwan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and police officers from Uganda were injured, 14 government vehicles were hit or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks of placid houses in Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike was making a scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, in the left face, broke a elbowed road towards their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male team coordinator, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or over - play a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we physically beat ourselves," said Mr. Li. She knows a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, the audience begins."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice lifted the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to an assistant in an old campaign and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the woman's husband, announced Wednesday the Senator's lawyers.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada who was considered a potential Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential office until the scandal around his case did the big national titles last year and did not affect his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" by the decision, the result of a one-year survey.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to keep any charge against him in this case."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this issue.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, who said there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative lobbying work to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the matter of the Senator with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during a Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited from lobbying with his former employer or Senate as a whole for a year.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seemed in contradiction with the so-called lobbying door ban.
According to evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be a prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to rape and substantial violation of the law of the turning door," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer from Washington who specializes in defending clients from an investigation by the government.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the department seemed to be disproved from political prosecutions after a number of high-level reversals by its section of public integrity, including the decision last year to abandon prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Director General of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the law don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer of Mr. Ensign, told him in an interview that on Monday he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice and followed him up the following day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed in a statement on Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutor's office.
"I am not comfortable with entering into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to leave an investigation following a complaint independent from the ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96,000 by Mr.Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the Senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's head of office, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "carried out" the Ministry of the Interior on a dispute issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he asked the transport secretary to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after committing Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr.Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his fourth Republican position in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to break a third term in the Senate.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, stated that the honourable senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were being tapped away in the ranks of the courtroom.
They sent out horrible testimony reports every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape case trial and children tied to their bed in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the widespread trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed elements to the court that outline appeals, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is causing, is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "cirque atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury was badly influenced by the public's passions.
The request could cause the appeals judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms is detrimental to the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, has inconclusively rejected the claims in the judgment rendered last week, claiming that the media were "sundryly controlled" and there was no evidence that the jury would have been motivated by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the question.
For decades, appeals have recognized that the media coverage of well-known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a ruling dated 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court annulled the conviction of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere in the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "Le fugitif".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of the hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford's Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from courtrooms could allow more fair trial.
Twitter's case is one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, likely to be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre pictures of criminal scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some jurors reported being horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers argue that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been critical to the prosecutors, and that he wrongly pressured a verdict by taking the unusual decision to bring the jury into a debate on a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates in the position of governor and in the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media did not cease to activate the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily bottleneck of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "was nothing like what had been seen here before, in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the new snapshots were more incendiary than the news releases delivered more slowly was a luddite view that would impoverish the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeals were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 that had overturned Dr Sheppard's conviction because of media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote, represented that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civilization approach the cleavage?
After a campaign marked by invectiveness and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a pre-cooperative sign of genuine bipartite cooperation before or at an illusory time before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
On Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not produce any insight into the major issues to be addressed during the session of the "boitous duck".
But of course, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The Commission's public meeting on Wednesday on the President's deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap, but that still divides members.
It is barely enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of testing and testing each other to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments by the participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too profound to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed in the past two years.
Whether it is taxation, spending, health care or rights, both parties remain within miles of distance.
Yet, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
Elections give rise to partisan passions and then collapse.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "boitous duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment allowances, it would be only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers without employment.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism was set on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "boitous duck", with the ratification of the "New START" Pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "Lame Duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once the things that must be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is going on between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the Chamber and to the electors present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to keep up with their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are now already clear in the initial responses to the recommendations of the deficit committee that include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, reposing the retirement age and reducing the expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in themselves, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plans as an official recommendation, and they have had a hard time reaching this number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected; this suggests that there are few reasons or compromises on tax issues, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first year will come next in the form of partisan confrontations, as the Republicans contest Obama's budget, taxes and health care; and then followed by a period of greater bi-partite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely demonstrated that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
The person who will be tried in loss will have to change his mind and find compromises.
However, this would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there were then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, both party activists see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more important election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a ground of understanding on matters that still divide them.
Divulged American Documents Describe Moscow as a Harbor of Corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and makes the Kremlin pass some of the winepots and the protective money it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate enterprises but also organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical power" - takes its part while money walks up the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on his website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been cleared.
It was written while Jouri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but since then there have been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the charges of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he stated what follows on a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting he was corrupted: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to a overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupted; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy account; and it is unusual to think that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to assert that the government was more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the embassy's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (the term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means " roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
"At last, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are found at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas where the city does not provide some services."
The report indicates that the FSB is raising money for larger companies and that the police are targeting small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was better to obtain the protection of the MVD and the FSB ( rather than organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself can be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their affairs closed on one pretext or another.
Medvedev mentioned several times the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy's note conveys reports of men carrying bags, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," he said in a recent interview with Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" in Moscow.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the costs of corruption would amount to more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy note, which was only realized yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly rekindle discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin made the assumption that WikiLeaks' documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger in front of the U.S. diplomats who had divulged by calling him Batman and rapprochementing Medvedev from Robin.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that it would be realized with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
The former fighters of the Khmer Rouge must face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with bad quality decrepit concrete walls, the director of the Anlong Veng high school mentioned the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer red to the northwest of Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, long-standing loyalty was finally challenged to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly headed with the United Nations, issued its first sentence concerning a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former chief of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In the face of this development, anxiety has increased with former Khmer Red fighters in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their will to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are feelings and fears among the former Khmer Red but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and defeated the Government of Pol Pot-U.S. in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements became in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas of their base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer red fighters began to defecate the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had taken the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 pending trial.
Without their beneficiaries, most of the former Khmer Red fighters have soaked in the black poverty common to the rural regions of Cambodia; and many are the ones that remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some Khmer red elite officers held their local leadership positions in return for depositing the weapons, they were unqualified farmers at the low grade and file.
"These people received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibed with the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a business environment is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, aged 55, who joined the Khmer Red as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we must meet our own needs."
The current Khmer Court has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court is expected to initiate the judgement of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former red Khmer minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and the principal perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he was pursuing those four cases.
It takes more to calm down the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations were directed to Im Chaem, 64 years old, former district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilots, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun was throwing long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodge is in peace and stability," she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who failed the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians contest this.
"Cambodge must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But dealing with the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he said.
"We have to put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as an supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the ties of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They are suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, says Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer red retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by the weeds and sprinkled with plastic bags, leads up to a black silk rectangle, covered with a rolled sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a tire pile after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, a mobile phone vendor on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she planned to walk to the last place of rest of Pol Pot where she would leave a bouquet of mature bananas in the hope of bringing chance.
Belarus accepts to give up its military-quality uranium stock
On Wednesday, the government of Belarus announced that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué published after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that certain classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-quality uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way to a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to a staff member who referred to the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation nuclear security summit, organized on the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit.
"This proves me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for World Security, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton called the "very significant, important step" agreement by Belarus.
Obama committed himself to securing all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in Prague in April 2009.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukachenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have maintained highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military quality uranium and low enriched uranium," said Loukachenko.
"It's our product ... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus drew close to the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing its interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to those responsible.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization has been implemented with a view to building confidence"; thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a director of the Department of Energy Specializing in the Reduction of the World Threat, said.
According to the estimates of the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-quality uranium this year, as well as hundreds of heavily enriched uranium kilograms.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But the Wednesday statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential for improving bilateral relations; and indispensable for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
Government has not objected to CIA flights
The government has not objected to the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading to Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, adding that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign planes that were crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe that accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Zapatero Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"From Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid "unspoiled," says Aguirre in a cable.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as she was in the hands of judges, the Government had limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to seek the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any criminal elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
The United States, however, expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly among Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the United States Ambassador and the Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though the Spanish judges are madly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a burning rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses concern about the action of the PP in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American guidance, our experience suggests that PP will certainly benefit from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has deliberately tolerated or ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even though such revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The parricide that passed to the confessions was complaining in the network of the "supply" to be mother
The girl was talking about the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: "Terreur à la galicienne"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used when she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natives of Noia, the village of the Coruña of which she originated.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, it is necessary to know his sentimental life, that ABC built with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tuñez, industrial.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, it was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
He was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to stay in the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyllic fractured, they separated.
In March 2008, she was in Minorque alone, and she wrote: "Alberto is very strange and watched for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed to him a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day long and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she had just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complained, "If it pleases him not, let him leave the boy with my mother, and I will take it from him when I return," she alleges.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'm only going to stay there until 19 because I have to go to a job to not lose it."
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him from my life with another person if this person is not my mother", a questionable intention, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there is another post.
When she hit him, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly murdered on the 10th of the month, was dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he's not on the other."
"On one side he's with me and he likes this place a little, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) at a few summer hours and like that I save some money from the baby-sitter."
On 17, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know which videos to the e-mail, you see, when he wants to, he finds me, shit."
On 30th, another: "The child is well, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "I'm moving forward with money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the liberator of the prison."
"Galician Land (Epigrapher)".
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He didn't want to think that everything had happened so she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the Minorque judicial detention centre.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the facts had happened, "and she didn't intend to hurt the minor either."
Prior to her confession, she drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited her body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor sought a psychiatric test.
Members of the People's Party would earn 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training obtains in these comedies normally double that it receives in Catalans.
For example, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in general in 2008, while the 2006 autonomys had 316,222.
On Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the election loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts in this training have calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CIU would also win four (now 10) and PSC would lose no more than 9 MPs (there are 25 MPs).
These calculations would show that the Catalan place is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member - he has three Members now - while ICV would keep a Member or earn one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal comedies, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relays to the head of the Barcelona General Council, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and people agree with the fact that CSP could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get the majority either the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fancy that this training loses its representation in the City Hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, including the mayor, Ángel Ros, maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they found themselves several times.
Populars have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven prisoners in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers of the General Police Information Commissioner of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell, which, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of Bombay's attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that "the Kampai operation" has "debilitated" the Al Qaida falsification device at international level and therefore its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that included the Al Qaida criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could pass the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The disbanded cell is the only one that the jihadist network in Europe had been operating, so in the investigations, other European police units participated, apart from Thai services, and that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days of similar blows to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained in Thailand, another took place with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who had run the cell in Bangkok in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports that met the conditions of the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents should be on behalf of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without visas.
Researchers point out that until now no details have been found that connects prisoners in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, we must remember that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia a transfer agency sent a few miles of dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the integrated "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police had a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Arthur Mas's conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and who decided to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address in half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples has arrived at the meeting with Arthur Mas with the security that gives the fact that he has obtained 18 Members at the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate from CiU requires at least one of the formations that the opposition will take a stand in the vote of the investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the time being, the talks that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereignist and independentist discourses should be eliminated", and economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader wants even to submit to the referendum.
The two leaders have shared their bets to weaken the political machinery of a very over-exaggerated self-government and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the Mas investment negotiation will take care of the PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICRC) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot centre do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The managers of the Girariat La Caritat d'Olot (Gérona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmaé, the nurse who killed at least 11 elderly people he was responsible for during the time he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with counsel from the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to charge against the person responsible" for the dead, but "law and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not detecting in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to The Caritat now takes the form of a major compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day he never stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally exploit the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of patients, formality was done by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can at no time have been the cause of what happened."
Counsel for La Caritat added that "in this case there is only a clue on the part of any other person other than the accused."
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by injecting an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the staff of the centre to physicians.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not say that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or instead burned them inside by giving them lessive as he has already confessed he did with the three women he killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor does the number of documented murders eliminate the possibility that the number will be greater and justify their attitude by the different versions of Vila's visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change of how to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB Threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to the threat of yesterday's Trichet which warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The differentials of the devices have closed and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, neither should we underestimate the ability of the ECB to cheat, and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but is motivated by short and very speculative closures of positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retreat tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" will be extended and will maintain the sale of unlimited access to quarterly auctions at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase programme and that we will even signal the intensification of it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be blind to withdraw liquidity measures, may God help us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered purchasing bonds and that they had broken the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Last year the one-year trade auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% from 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have lowered 30 basic points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
Figures from the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval from its new budget and it still does not have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of deficit, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment are in the ears of investors such as the four seasons in Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has undergone 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will be benefited by the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be resolved with a strong demand and helps to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Spain's claim for a Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, Treasury has more than 40,000 million cash available, triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut access to the sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "other than being, to appear."
Courage, we can get out of it!
President of Eulen will contest Vega Sicilia's council requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, as he considers it "noul de droit", El Enebro's judicial council on the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take on the management bodies of the company owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
From his Board of Directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators in the Shareholders' Assembly on January 18 this year, whose contest is recorded in the Register of Commerce and Corporations.
El Enebro's judicial council for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 in Madrid, reopened the tuna box within the Alvarez family.
The use of the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as "a desperate resort of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly violating the Law and by abusing the law, validating and correcting the assembly radically void on 18 January", according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the argument that, once the assembly takes place, it will be contested considering that it is "nothing in full right".
The same protagonists, who remain silent, have already tried without success that the magistrate convenes a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group seeks to use it in 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the matter of substance that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request for a dispute for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the rising trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as a champion's pilot, German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propelles his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
In reality, this is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching objectives from high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create installation chains for manufacturers all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, in charge of Siemens' industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young highly qualified professionals are working, equipped with powerful computer equipment to analyse and project all kinds of changes to the bills.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull's boules except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the sole limitation of this madness of technological development, there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has deployed the high-tech plant to create and produce its bowls in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that's going on there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty has 580 people, including two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 Red Bull, probably, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put in the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety is null.
The plant's technology director, Steve Nevey, says five years ago, we could say that R+D's progress in the case of racing cars was 50% of the wins and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of the success, while the pilots bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer, as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened in Barcelona his first exclusive store in collaboration with his associate Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 businesses between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plan to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's Vice-President Helena Herrero gave as an example the renovated store located on the Gran Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which it has been working for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to implement 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, that of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HM personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of exclusive store furniture (with products that can be affected in an interactive manner), which in Europe will have the same picture.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trading network claims to "improve service to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneering pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bet on 'flight' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardianiola, thinks that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in the margins of interest, which will try to offset partially with increases in fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million particular customers in three years, his task to do.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and is able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will be a three-year process.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to make use of FROB public subsidies, is to gain a market share through the capture of one million new customers - 700,000 if those who can get out of the bank are deduced, its great task to do so, because so far this bank has ruined SMEs and companies more than the individual customer.
This year he picked up 250,000 customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another base of the 2011-2013 plan is bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, of austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks are now reluctant to set targets and make them public because the financial crisis has disturbed all plans of the world banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year his Master Plan Optima, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for an additional fiscal year.
Customers who let the savings banks escape will be their main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardianola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks the exit of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liability war - which penalises margins - is reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and cash pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving at the credit price to compensate for the drop in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," he said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincinoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It's not in vain that he ensures that in Spain "we will seek greater dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he assured.
He claims that the capital needs "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fund-raising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it has reduced the importance that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that one cannot issue, but rather what happened in June, one can obtain short-term funding through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between caisses
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the merger of Spanish savings banks started, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Épargnes (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been realized, it can't be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Cívica Bank group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most have been fully realized; it is possible that instead of going to 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is "at the greatest speed possible and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the timeframes that have been set in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The passage of 45 cases with an average of 28,500 million assets volume to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are quite few happy opinions on the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remind us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed to people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of "very important" concentration and "go as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had taken advantage of the stress tests that the ECB had carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has established the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets resulted in a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or removal of 426 euros of unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of airports in Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the critics of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to her responsibility for highlighting the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is shocking to the maintenance of the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, the three possible outbreaks of the crisis have begun to be speculated in Germany.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, Mark's recovery, even though it now seems like science fiction, with a very favourable opinion stream, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission encouraged deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (tax rigour plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel had hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on, it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the publication were against Greece's rescue.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to make possible the recovery of a country and at the same time obliged private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, because it rushed the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although slightly sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should be attending the Union reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she does not think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree, from that date the old operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in a cessation of payments and in this case the private sector will also bear part of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The release is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asking is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater tranquillity.
And that we are aware of the opportunity that has been given to us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of last Saturday with the big companies and the announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, we have opened the way to the the thesis that we must put order at home.
But the red line Germany has drawn is here, and they don't seem to move it.
And one of the possibilities we are considering cannot be excluded from leaving a monetary zone too crowded in less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The Russians similar to Alonso and Ramos versus Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
The tedious expulsion in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the League of Champions has caused a lot of ink on the anti-sport character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team had already won clearly), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
So, and as Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will perform the regulatory sanction during the next game of the Auxerre Dam and will be able to pass without cards at the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Discipline Committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches, and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow cardboard in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of theethos, unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
A part of the debate in the case reported is due to the fact that this has been the protagonist of a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his hymn shows nobility and honor and who, on previous occasions, has condemned a fine to its players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode more to his dilated history of his his his histrionic and provocative technician.
In any event, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is expressly not prohibited by the regulation contradicting the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is a fraud of law with these actions; because they are, in fact, respectful actions with the sport regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of injury they cause to the sport spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, one aspect that has not been jeopardized with these actions, i.e. there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that we allude to with the right game is to avoid the team of infringing players in an unfair way of the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the actions of the players in Real Madrid is that it is not comfortable with what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in secret to try to avoid punishment, but their action has tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and willingly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the kind of benefit that offenders get from the deliberate errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that there is no disadvantage to the rival and there is no advantage in the same match either, because of course the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated all at once and apart from that, with this action players perform a penalty match and move on to the second round of cardboard, in which suspension due to cardboard accumulation occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So, to scale up, it's not so clear that this is an advantage.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sport spirit, which is still part of the strategic decision-making that promotes the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of the fraud of the law), but instead chose the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without enjoying or escaping the penalty.
Although the border between genius and the fraud of the law is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy seems to me to be due to two factors: because there were two self-expulsiones and because of how to transmit the guideline to provoke them.
The evil caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to pick up Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December comes back also the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but which have resulted in an offensive your price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, matching the business men and associations of the interviewed sector.
To make accounting difficult, this year's calendar (such as the night of Saint Sylvestre falls Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for pic days (on 17th and 17th and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restoration of Barcelona, Gaiteàtà Farrás.
The employer's representative now does not intend to predict what parties will be like this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to go out but pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The case will be "for those who give quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so the tranche around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey at various institutions in the centre, the collapse of applications for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic demand boom for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar has assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate parties in advance.
At their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as the Catalan wine produced by the champagne - 'cava' method.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
From the patronate Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment in Barcelona), his vice president, Enric Gomà, confides in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "animated", even though customers "dnegotiate at most".
This is true, the hope for festivals has not diminished, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme causes great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy of Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistan nuclear programme causes in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
Thus, the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials including short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and a reason for maintaining custody.
"Pakistan has an opportunity to hire staff with strong religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev, from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is increasingly limited cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A statement from the Embassy in May, which calls for "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, supports the following: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to understand "very clearly" to the person responsible that "the Army of Pakistan must end with the silent support of terrorist groups".
Hunting the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will number a senior anti-terrorist officer to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alert to follow the movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and track Assange's movements".
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Moreover, it is not new, otherwise it is dated November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents in the United States, but with the charges of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator lawyer Mark Stephens assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On 20 the International Police Corps in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday after receiving permission from the authorities of Sweden.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have received the indication of identifying or locating Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Even if Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red call to indicate a free way for arrest -- that the national police body must realize - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be located.
The movement outraged Assange lawyers, who published yesterday a letter denouncing the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, was willing to respond by video-conferencing to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," he denounces the mission.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he was not standing.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to the U.S. graduates that they appeal to the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculate and absurd."
"I'm not sure why a guy's opinion with a web page should interest us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a senior anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The trial of President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who, as of January, will preside over the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber, asked the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further, Tom Flanagan, a Canadian President's advisor, Stephen Harper, has to return to his statements after saying that Assange will "be murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use a plane without crew or something similar."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"He who finds himself in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and whatever is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," he said to Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with eyelashes to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet offers a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the entire internal rebellion within ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party's president is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and that it cannot give him any headaches he had with other extinguished currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eyelashes that allow him to remain until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by lifting your hand.
If the Carodists want to issue a certain penalty vote to the President, they can do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half one more vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgarian" would also be good.
People close to Carod require the president a little more than to make his position available for the militia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the executive a roadmap until May.
For this, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the convention for the fall of 2011, which leaders consider to be a secure fact.
The leader of the ERC acknowledged that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to make the organization once and for all capable of washing its household linen.
In this line, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the Ideologist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovation thought the fact that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of which he pointed out.
The first, to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, that is, to include new figures from the Adept Sector of Carod.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the holding of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, who has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 convulsive convulsion directed the review of the assembly model at a specific convention for the reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors at work, the time could be good for taking it back and closing it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, less than four in the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in the Mexico Valley.
During the previous month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the one of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of firearm and the blow of the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of a vehicle abandoned on the street Mixtecs in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan municipality.
Early on Thursday morning, on the fourth, the landowners in common found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots of fire when he left his house to initiate the work of collecting garbage.
On 7 November, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a fire-fighting impact at the head each in the colony San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the front, a man's body was found on a lonely path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body, we found a percussion bullet of firearms of caliber 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Tepotzotlán residents warned about the discovery of a dead body in Peña Colorada, the hands behind and the eyes banded.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot in the neck.
Half of the month the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, and two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony we found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On 17, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the village Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning they located the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck we found the lifeless body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Aquautla.
On the woman's skin we detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with his image.
By the end of the month, the body of a man was found on a car in the municipality of Zinacantpec with at least three shots of bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with the red head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who don't align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with the hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the San Agustín colony's Centre of Justice.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of the country in COP16 assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the coal footprint and had detailed that he maintained his offer to reduce between 40 and 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.
China maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assured Su Wei, representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the Sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and to convert its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its goals, but would continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and pilot programme support.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated way with governments and local authorities to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction goals.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received United Nations (UN) investments, government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of filament lamps by savings lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he has detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a Scientific Advisor to the Government of this country with regard to climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than we thought.
For example, it has stated that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, she has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to do another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The National Leader of PAN has detailed that the former Pakistani leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former bakery leader had the right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that, in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, if any, by making a complaint to the National Council's Commission of Order, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been on the negotiating table an alliance for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed conviction that National Action would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4th and 5th December where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that has succeeded and achieved its goal," he said.
The baker mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we will enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council would probably choose the best leader and the National Action required for the next three years, so he would give the next "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party's president's office to any of the five."
He expected that the Party's relaunch at the elections that took place on 4 July will be reflected in the next debate, even though "this is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the time being it is to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that come from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation across the country, so that we have become "many hopes for them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When one asked about PRI's criticism against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the prisoners to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gorturi.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; they begin to defend them; that they come out of 'armour'," he said.
He said that the federal executive can make expressions like those he did in his address in the National Auditory, because in the country there is no balion, and less censorship.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter for students without papers
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitte American President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said Twitter Obama.
His short message maintains an open cyber link with a wider document that calls on the public to contact senators immediately as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the Bush tax reductions and the government's funding were extended.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs spokesperson said he was confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved by the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a certain time in this sense and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The Leader of the Democratic Majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "vote to close the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize students without papers could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, even though it would be most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American River Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, remained in that country in the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the competition of a large number of Republicans, at times when partisan organizations of the project are active in lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed his mandate for Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they wouldn't support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the greatest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants spread the story
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the plague? what do you expect of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and this time used the title of his question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to the Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the plaie"...we put ourselves in embarrassment," the Argentine writer began slowly to the public, most of the young people, who had met at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what is the "plaie", she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiousologist she is convinced: "The patience is not my strength, it may be my plague."
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that plaice is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the plague is what is actually opened, the symbol is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "On the plague I only knew that it is the one that is actually open and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very close to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguayen Sergio Ramírez also presented a fascinating narration he named after Éloge at the invention, where the finger on the plaie is not named but at a given time is discovered.
With magical realism, he spoke of a famous insurgency that touched the clouds, returned people who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a story that turns to speak to America, the great news that had had from the beginning its own chronics and cited to Bernal Díaz del Castillo that criticized the excesses of the stories of the winning captains.
"Cervants who invented us all (the writers) mocked false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that was even lacking in the pudour."
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "crazy and liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know what part of the story belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its apogue.
This is actually called the 'Cervantes tradition'.
"It's because of his heritage that we're counting on."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with his round table He owes it to the plaia.
Cuba-Portuguese has placed itself on the great scourge of social violence that its country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - produces the fights of trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs contain a tacit commitment which is not of course premeditated," she said, after mentioning that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "this must be on the wound of the writer engaged".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed as well as with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "the last of every affirmation is a small no and behind each denial there is a little yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put a finger on the plague and to disturb people who feel very comfortable by thinking about caricature, in white and black, established ideas and without nuance and also to disturb the powers that prefer a white and black world," he said, inviting people to regain the sense of writing.
Roman to the hunting of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find among them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals, he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series, even if he hasn't so far put in the thousand and that's why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentin ended up comforting himself with the underchampion medal, he stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive endings.
The Sanste strategy came to its first final as a coach in the 2002 Tournoi d'Openture when it held the reins of Morelia with which it lost with a overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure it also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was specifically against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournoi Bicentenaire 2010, again against the Diablos, Rubén again suffered a reversal, because his team had a match equal to 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he obtained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump on the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same luck, he tries to take off evil so he can celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," he commented when asked him what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot about the last final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to draw us were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we cannot celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not concern him, because he trusts in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish within the regular period, but sometimes we just get ready, the previous tournament has been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety of holding the title between our hands, hands he has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we will no longer arrive in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a subchampion technician and to taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
People must go to Visa Applicants Service centres prior to their interview with the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedure for the processing of visas at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to appear at Visa Applicants' Service Centres (ASCs) before their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will provide some benefits for the applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, there will be no need to make a payment for an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including temporary workers visas) and $390 for visas of traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visas will not have to appear at an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CSA, applicants who wish a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants to the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service rate of $26.
For further information on the new procedure to apply for the visa, visit http://mexico.usembassy.gov/bolets/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration of the Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, science studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured her that she would present an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which has sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that we thought was too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses the arsenic as a way of living and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will participate in the geobiology of Pamela Conrad, which studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of Titan’s scientists (the largest satellite in Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Block Pattern Opposing
With reforms to the Organic Congress Act, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th was just settled when the Congress appeared to be an opposing bloc led by PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four asked one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, de PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, de PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they repeated, we started the 'bipartism' because now there are two people, the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Director chaired by the Panelist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms institutionally, we constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the pattern from political will and if they did not, they would be served again by both parties and thus will end the opposing coalition.
"Up until now (the opposite coalition), this is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It is not possible to allow, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"This is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartisanism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they now speak to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress has now transformed into a 'butin' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, they now divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the Member, to give his place to the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave with cupular agreements outside of 5 which will probably be Members, now to the five that we see, separated from different fractions, we have decided to join in seeking a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have done, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Maîrie de Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the electric equipment company.
Another check of about 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, the last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "requirement of supplier accounts".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno said the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Auditor to sell at a higher price.
What was not reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just paid him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reaped" in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and November 16th.
Even if the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasury Board has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25, Northwest, had published a review of the cheques that the Mairie issued to its suppliers, revealing that in the mid-March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos over 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourism sites must be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada round in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a corner of the Sánchez Taboada round, the tourism sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Association of Traders of Zone Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly asked that the image of the destination be cared for and new activities should replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and sidewalks affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid close trades.
"Politics only know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune that we lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without adequate planning."
Host José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Mayor.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not just correct it," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live in it and the City must change its strategy to maintain the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it only depends on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given them the attention they need and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious for all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under the secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán tourist sites is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that need to get in line with the municipality and be a priority for having the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Herely Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that should first be ordered, cleaned and put on line to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP Demands Results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that Members bear the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations faced.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a law of decent and free work between the parties and the Government Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was set up by seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the Party of the New Alliance, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence and one of PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that new government Congress members are a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that Members bear the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations faced.
"We hope that Members of Parliament will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties, because the custom is that they make covenants to secure their own interests and turn into a carnival mask of governors and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certify their commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do dignified work and mostly engage with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces by looking for economic growth in the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they grow economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance of the Government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and is incongruous as important economic activity and generating currency and investment and which directly rivals with agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources must be classified into detonating tourism projects that help to ensure the security of the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation has not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a king mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi Kings will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, for their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will carry their toys and clothes as much as they want.
The family lives in a humble home in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live on a day-to-day basis because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plèbes' to sell on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo long aspires to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothes of size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him, 'We will see, my son', because he was very expensive', they remember with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11-year-old, shoes the size 12; Isaiah, 10-year-old, shoes the size 10, while Miguel, 8-year-old, shoes the size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make reality the children's dream of the family Coronado Valenzuela you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, giving a toy or money at the reception of Northwest.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie, Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of Haschich, silver and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Sûreté.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
The arrested persons were to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could deal with charges of cannabis production, possession for traffic, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were carried out following a long-term survey, which lasted about a year.
"It was the information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," said Mr.Ruel.
Some 70 police officers of the Regional Investigation Module of the Quebec Security Strait, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Regie participated in this police operation.
Immigrant migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' Bill, which, according to the government, should address the problem of illegal migrants, is obviously going to be fought while the three opposition parties said Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet," said Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to a year's detention of anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he took it to the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, rejected criticism from the hands that its party was not strong enough about clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it takes refugees and imprisons children for at least one year," Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians tell MPs massively that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a clown."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," responded Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections upon its rejection.
A Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to request a vote for each member who opposes to explain himself in front of his constituents.
The new unit does not act unanimously
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this matter as of January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
Nor was it necessary for the Pakistani public security criticism, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement of "the rabbit out of a hat" and "brickled solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it, just say it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest objected to not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have an investigation commission is to resign Jean Charest," says Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
He therefore suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believed that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent escort is not the only project in the Charest government cards.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently discussing certain amendments to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which hit the motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code was inadequate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently adopted the Act on Gangsterism.
High-supervised rivers
Several watercourses remain under high surveillance due to heavy precipitation that has been dropped in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimetres of additional rain were expected by Thursday evening, according to the regions.
Sectors north of the river and in the Outauauais Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the already accumulated snow source in some sectors, several streams of water are feared.
Warnings of flood alert were issued on Wednesday night by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in St.Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and the Chêne, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the overflow of certain lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away because of the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measures.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes led to the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on an alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annnik Bouchard, a security adviser.
Quebec's Crus Prediction Centre has been issued on Wednesday with warnings of strong crus for several rivers, including Maskinongé, Assomption, Oureau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partly Blamed Dupont
Quebec's radio entertainer Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial reversal before the Canadian Radio-television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its crude language in waves.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and crude language that did not fit the broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CNRC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Quebec Joint Front of Social Assistance.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Animators must provide solid information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, facilitator Stéphane Dupont felt that suicide was a gesture of lethargy.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont the noon" have addressed a delicate matter in an equitable and appropriate manner."
So no blame has been taken in his place.
The last dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then turned to a media face-to-face that had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI facilitator stated that he had made no gift to help the Haitians because we could not be sure that the people in need would really receive money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension over there."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the entertainer.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of coarse language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station that will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montrealis of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely particular route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and boxing Thai climbs to the tatami and rings of the world looking for new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve with professionals."
"In my case, I seek fights a little everywhere, since for those who do not like the game on the ground present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and as a commission for the UPS company has just issued bad news to its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur World Championship (WKA) from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the category of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing, he explained."
"Now I'm getting ready to go to China for the San-hou World Cup."
"The fighters who ended up among the first four in the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the fifth tournament, while I arrived in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've progressed to every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punching and foot blows, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
Duels are originally held on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned boxer from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will surely respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most noted and most prestigious in China, explained the friendly Gaillard."
"It's a bit the equivalent of the Limpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a super experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four fighters by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the half-finals face at the end of their class."
"Then the winners of each category are faced with to crown a single champion, the king of the kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor companies that obtained the most important, that of project management, for a sum of $295 million without call for tenders.
This consortium, called Energy Management, was formed in 2004 in a manner consistent with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Management Consortium found the lucrative contract without any public tenders.
For the Quebec Party, the use of consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is the new way to do collusion and overthrow competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing this in a secret way, now do it openly," said Pakistani MP Sylvain Simard in press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he could hardly see how the public's interest could be used in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, denying strongly that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my journey," she insisted, claiming that the PQ had been "bad" and had "lack of rigour".
She said, "that would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a limited time alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The site is in progress and is scheduled to step up until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the Consorts' formula in the engineering consulting sector was the subject of an investigation into the government.
A quick overview of the Quebec Business Register allows more than 200 consortiums, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same moral person, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a special way since the 1970s".
The boss of the Eastmain Project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made it easier to emphasize that the project management contract was granted freely.
"If you go for offers and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the competence of people," said Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has expanded 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting his participation in Energy management.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known in the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these "Fincent" companies, before clarifying that they were its leaders.
Responsible Consumer Barometer - The "green" label inspires no confidence
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair trade marks and eco-friendly certifications to guide his choices.
Tis, even though he bathes in a media universe where messages for more responsible consumption are stirring, he deplores a lack of credible information, lack that he even qualifies as a brake to his commitment, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, the first reading of which was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, however, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the company's environmental commitment as well as the company's green advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's responsible Consumer Observatory.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands displaying themselves as co-responsible, indicates the Barometer.
In the same vein, the politicians' speech on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Responsible consumer information, however, seems to be crucial in stimulating this current consumption pattern of almost one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the void and the doubtful nature of the information would calm the fiery people of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also say that they are also suspicious of the alleged performances of green products or services that they seek to put into their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and above all to brand one or more products to meet their convictions.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from shoppers in their neighborhoods and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and Responsible - the responsible consumer index has reached 64 out of 100 for this year - the Homo consumer of Quebec likes to appear as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport or recommended co-carpooling to defend their green interests.
The walk and bike were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just taken its first click.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but with only one loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which hoped for a gift of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, giving it its full cinematic vocation, did not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to involve itself in the file, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan of which the amount would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources of state offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have been reviewed at a downward rate.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who piloted the eXcentris file.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the counter-proposition of the cabinet arrived at SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31st to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the State's gift should really be ignored.
Let us recall that the Association of the owners of cinemas and cinema parks of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several environmental stakeholders called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, held the author's cinema in his complex premises for ten years after funding his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films was screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had his loyalty to his clientele.
The Société Angus and the Parallèle, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilot, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Paralléle, continues to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February next by projecting the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember Le Devoir and we don't know what he and his group think of the downside proposals they are making.
Sailing on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables divulged by WikiLeaks raise the veil of what the United States considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but at the same time betray the feeling of superiority of the Americans to Canada.
As a result, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, based on the public square yesterday, offer more crunchy details than substantial content to get under the teeth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, or in the federal electoral campaign, reports how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins has a few explanations for this.
"A nearly inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to speak about everyday internal issues rather than to have this election held on the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign) ", he wrote.
The United States, therefore, concludes, "the Elephant proverbial of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands, at least, this "disturbing silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"The ability of a candidate, a party, and even more than a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the government's survival in the early February confidence vote on the federal budget, by which Canada will display its first deficit in more than a decade due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," said Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, prevents Washington's increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast at CBC refer to the United States.
Ambassador is concerned about the emissions Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or to the removals for muscular interrogations of the CIA.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to host some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the responsible for this massive flight should be "killed".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday to Cancún a plan for the renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases (GES) which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact ampoules or, better, by bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED"), most of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emitted on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the global car park's emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, large issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that are expected to move global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will still need to be subtracted from this balance of 5 gt to stabilize by 2020 the rise of the climate at 2 centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact ampoules, energy spending is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new light bulbs in DEL, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rhéostats as well as emit very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have posted reservations in the area of fluocompact ampoules as they contain mercury and they need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except if the manufacturers put in place a record.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather the coal thermal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity spent in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and 8 million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction costs 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire awaits the announcement of election results in nervousness
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the interim results without further delay, stressed a spokesperson for the United Nations leader."
"He calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the deadline of Wednesday midnight to pass without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday poll.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the president of the CIS had stated on television that the commission "continues to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied in the world on Wednesday so that the CIS finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudious" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian President, said that the bullying maneuvers of the electors practiced by the FNs in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are considered by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's opponents feel that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northman who denies any connection with the former rebels, found the delay in announcing the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and complains to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from spreading the results, it would be illegal.
On Sunday's second round, the presidential was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, which received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3 per cent in metropolis (9.7 per cent in the overseas departments), showing the corrected data of the provisional seasonal variations (CVS) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the population active in metropolis and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over one year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 points.
More generally, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether they were available in the two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
For their part, seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points in three months as well as over one year), to 482,000 people aged 50 years or older, and to 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of unemployment remained stable in the third quarter, 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 points over three months, +0.1 points over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee has no longer published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini being examined and detained
Alexandre Guerini, 53, head of waste-processing companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and defeated at the Luynes detention house, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini was examined for the abuse of social goods, diversion of funds and public goods, recel, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, his lawyer indicated.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and tends to explain himself about all the questions the magistrate is going to ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's something else to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told the AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, the brother of the PS strong man in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, had, through his lawyers, to make the judge pass before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his close relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday evening and collapsed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but run the discharges he had to manage.
As to the allocation of markets or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he has never had any knowledge of them, Mr Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director-general of the services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was examined on Wednesday for diversion of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the file.
"My client has been able to provide explanations to the facts that are being blamed for him."
"The investigating magistrate took it into account by not depriving him of his freedom," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday night at Wednesday, with placement under judicial supervision for two of them, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General for the Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is continued for "trafic of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being examined for "substantiation and diversion of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity of diversion of public funds".
Finally, the company of Alexander Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "recel of abuse of social property".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guerini figure Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently collapsed in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement of the Corse.
Investigators suspect their companies that they have served to whiten out money from big banditry.
The investigation is conducted in the framework of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public procurement, particularly in the waste sector.
As a source of the investigation, the investigation focuses on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne and some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spinning", held the opinion in haleine in France, warned diplomacy, and increased the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée has explained its strategy to the Americans, so far as to give them advice for the treatment of their own "optage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders have sought to convince Washington that the release of young French had not been for the return of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place in a raw light the way in which the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The Elysée Councillor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with American diplomat Kathleen Alllegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals forced into Iran.
"Believes of noise," they say, "go on marching" in the media the words "rights of fundamental man", "innocency", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do so all the more than the Iranians ask you not to."
Because, past the attempts of discussions by discreet channels, "silence will not regulate anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilatatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was "a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, on the day she took refuge at the French Embassy) "will need to pay the Iranians a large amount of money" (€230,000 bail).
And it reveals that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains locked in Iran.
Information is being disseminated: Iran Majid Kakavand, whose US demands extradition for illegal traffic of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on a judge's decision.
The American Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of nuclear material, Majid Khakavand's expansion is bad news.
Did France accept a trade?
The release of Iran against the release of French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Alllegrone on September 4, François Richier made sure that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, not only "was completely surprised by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision", he observed.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Councillor of the Elysée consists of a telephone number, closes and then informs the U.S. diplomat that Iran "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss's detention in Iran, the Elysée does not carry out its efforts, through media releases and "fleets", to suggest that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role as "meditor".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that manipulation bears fruit as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the "blitz" media of French officials".
On what basis is so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials recognize in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then looks at the reasons why the Elysée had to pay in this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria", he analysed.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immeasurable".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows it's a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least sow confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the release of our country".
No online games for young Koreans spent midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Cendrillon" law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under 16 years of age, have reported representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and the right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the responsible ministerial officer in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the enforcement of the law, he has specified.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit their daily access time to these games for young people whose parents are applying for them, the manager added.
It will also make available to people who request free software to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online games competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, opposite 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designates the organizing countries
In the wake of suspected corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee, on Thursday, appoints the organizing countries of the World Cups 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where the fights of influence and lobbying are likely to take the step on the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the queen Fifa competition will take place in Europe, traditional foundation of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of the Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political issues of a World.
The backstage treatments are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, the English, Hispanic-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the beginning of the revelations that resulted in the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Tetrii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of her country, the cradle of football that only once hosted the World Cup in 1966.
The BBC gave it a layer on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that paints three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to dishearten Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 obtained the organization of the JO-2012 for London.
Will this intense activity be enough to reorient England's blouse to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could dwindle their ambitions.
Any retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increases Russia's rating, becoming a weight outsider despite the gaps in its file (city, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced a "loyal competition in the preparation of the vote", in an allusion barely veiled to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Mr. Putin launched.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appeared as the logical favors.
First world economic power, seat of Fifa's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long lead on Japan and South Korea, which separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the World-2026 to China, heavily desired by Fifa, which would in fact make Asian chances abrupt for 2022.
With Qatar, which came out of the big game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion to new territories, but these two countries are more likely than certain ones.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights acquired (due to the time shift) by European countries, the nerve of the war for Fifa.
Second mandate: Evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him hesitate.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not had the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One warrant to the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence is not good cleaning with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then we have to act as if the doubt still exists.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without belief, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a severe air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "who leaves in the fall of 2011".
Let him mention to the UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening in the Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has thus sown a bit of febrillity.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five years to two.
He made a note, not an ad.
This is not the first time that he mentioned the president, on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"Or worse, or at best, you still have for seven and a half years with me," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebel in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His earlier remarks make him no more candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
If they give comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the PS candidacy race, on the one hand.
But this isn't the high school entrance to Segolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to open up.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is clear that many of the PS are demanding a more early battle order than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer François Filon's candidacy to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP above," immediately and prudently reacted to the Prime Minister's surroundings.
"If he believes the defeat possible, he will not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin says.
"He will always believe he can win," corrected Alain Juppé, rescinded to the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its purchases of State securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities of exit of crisis or at least to announce the closure of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that must be completed at the end of the year.
Europe's sovereign debt crisis is forcing the Frankfurt Emissions Institute to not allow itself to be as peremptory in order to worsen a situation which is still more tense today on European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond procurement programme.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...)."
The next day, in Brussels, at the hearing of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more dissert as to his intentions, merely saying that the State securities purchase programme on the secondary market "was going to continue" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main exchange rate at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
As a matter of fact, the purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week to nearly EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indiscretion, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the euro system have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the anticipation of a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists do not expect significant changes either.
If lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on a generous basis and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she's significantly changing her program."
"If it weren't to take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", anticipated by Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations to animate an atonous market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is necessary for him to substitute for the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the packaging of the returns paid by the most fragile states," said an important mandatory manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are increasing, States will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, or to stabilize it.
The safeguard of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government goes round
After a worrying beginning of the week for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed yesterday, with the decline of compulsory rates to 10 years.
A return to the precarious calm.
Upon leaving a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the presidents of the region said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "undecidable" and wait for a "unpredictable" weekend, which he later denied.
Tuesday, in any case, the gap with German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of coverage contracts against bankruptcy risk (CDS) had flown to 263 points, leading to a certain collapse in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the difference with German rates was above 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was declared "strongly concerned" by "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of the tax revenues that go with, making the State the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The last forecast in Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate is about 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% of government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the rumor of a new budget group that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," says the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is supported by international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," assures Arigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short- and long-term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are less than those requested in other countries," said Pier Carlo Paduan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which early elections could be held in late March.
It would then open up a period which would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still hammered it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that it has been demonstrated on Sundays and at nights, are obviously solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although any relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European State bonds has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we still can't talk about a start of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's notation agency announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target of speculation today.
"As of May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on banking systems in particular," said Economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and of the dangers it calls for, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more generally, with their G20 peers go well.
This is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin of the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support countries in the euro area in the market pillar (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a round in Singapore on Tuesday in Asia to inform the extreme-oriented investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for such visits.
The first EDF securities issues are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative entrusted the Reuters agency with the support of a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries which are on the front line, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to the closer-impact austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those in Greece and Ireland.
Both of them are willing to avoid asking for international aid before putting in place their own budgetary corrections and to decide on structural reforms that are necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors look at the options available to accelerate the process of standardisation of sovereign bond markets.
By way of passage to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had first advanced the idea that if the 750 billion euro mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to turn its hands to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading actor in the European sovereign debt market, believe that a build of about EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct cash injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with up to now EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions were worse.
Neige et verglas: 24 departments in orange alert
Neigious episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Britain, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alert because of the risk of snow and ice.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Neigious episodes are significant enough to create traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, states Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned from heavy weights of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannon and Saint-Brieuc-Ludeac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes that recommend taking his vehicle only if necessary and the circulation of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was prohibited for Thursday in Picardia.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy weights.
The prefecture "invits all motorists to greater caution on the roads and adapt their conduct accordingly."
The Civil Aviation Branch (CAD) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights to the Parisian Roissy airport and 10% to Orly due to upcoming snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been going on, the billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro is to be built by the Society of the Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is the sum that will then enable the GSP to borrow part of the financing of its dual loop on the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Financial Corrigendum Act 2010, which was discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of the money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is numbered: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is an adjustment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase its product and to allocate this increase to the Society of the Grand Paris".
How much would that report?
Mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're far from four billion.
"It is stated that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Society of the Grand Paris as a result of the project", can be read in the statement of reasons.
At the GSP, we can't find this shocking system.
"From the time we create revenue (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion later, we explain."
"This will be included in the budget and drawn as well as measured."
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are still missing subscribers, is likely to provoke a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers Avengers and Expeditions
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal which appears only in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's sinisterly caricature profile had long been for sket material cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of news already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the earlier works.
And not only because the author of hidden texts does not like to do unpublished research (he doesn't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who want occultism believe only in what they already know, and who confirms what they have already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Same for secret files.
The informer is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the chief of secret services (if it could be, I know, editor at Libération), which retains as true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same information as the newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of State can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into centres of espionage.
Any viewer of research films knows this very well, and it's only through hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and it serves to put American diplomacy under a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the state department.
So the scandal does not put the victims as much crisis as the "bourreaux".
But let us come to the deep nature of what has happened.
So, in Orwell's time, we could design everything as a Big Brother that controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been fully proven since, having been able to control each movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when one demonstrates, as now happens, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
The power to control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - may know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret of secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power.
WikiLeaks did nothing wrong with Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this very powerful injury?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to put on the line any reserved information - that would be published on a side-by-side poster.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is worth waiting to be able to maintain confidential reports by phone.
Nothing easier than discovering whether and when a head of state moved by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relations be maintained in the future?
I know that for the time being my forecast is based on science-fiction and is therefore Romanesque, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who discreetly move in diligence to uncontrollable itineraries, as they carry only messages learned by heart or, at the very least, by hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in single copies in key-closed drawers: deep down, the Watergate spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology now progresses in crabs, i.e. back to back.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on threads (telephones).
The videocassettes (analogues) had allowed cinema researchers to explore a step-by-step film, going forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digital) allow only to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, and the travels it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not extraordinary that communication policy and techniques go back to the horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France doubles its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider compliance with the promise of fast-tracked funding (such as fast start or early funding) made by developed countries.
And the big French bidouillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU came out of the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, major side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do likewise with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010 EUR 2.2 billion has been released, which puts it on the right track to meet its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of the Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France had blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has considered as a reference in 2009: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditures in previous years or at the overall level of Public Development Assistance.
Indeed, France's total support for developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), she claims to respect her commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their mode of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ lent is equivalent to 1€ given.
Of course, this is hardly justified: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission mitigation that are based on more efficient technologies), it is wrong to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given ... At the same time, it should not be counted under its commitments than the cost of the loan to the lender country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has to make such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass-pass tour!
In short, in its fast start funding, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of action in time and on the other on the reality of financial effort.
With only €36.1 million in mind, she has come to believe that she spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who led the arbitration) could have a negative double impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it was enough to lend ?) and in negotiations as developing countries are not entirely burdensome...
The chapter on early funding is only a small, relatively short-term issue, compared with all climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
In any event, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its mode of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): there will be no escape from the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would naturally increase the level of international confidence needed to advance in the discussions.
Child-ingested pesticide alert
A 10-year-old boy ingests on a different day 81 chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday of the Association Generations Futures (former Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which predicts that its results "are not of significant statistical value in terms of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought food generally consumed in four meals between July and September and a one-day meal by a child of ten years in the Oise and Paris supermarkets.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as friandises, have been examined by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as potential or probable carcinogenic and five substances classified as carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we see in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is worrying," the association noted.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as some carcinogenic as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided for by the study, presents traces of six chemicals, of which a fungicide is still prohibited in France.
The same for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the EU.
In addition, steak, tin in box, and even the bread baguette and chewing gum were truffled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "the urgent face of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "an increase in civilization's diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereals.
