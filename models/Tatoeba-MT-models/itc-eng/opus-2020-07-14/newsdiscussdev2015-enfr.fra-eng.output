I think it looks like a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But it doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that says it's common in rugby is big anything...
Yes at last we don't interrupt the Muslims' prayers and we don't break the person's nose during the drinking games (in the end, except if it's part of the game), but we actually painted black for some disguised evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first-year students seemed rather typical to me.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt in my eyes that they go far beyond misogynistic jokes and jokes under the influence of alcohol often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows in particular that they are trying to make the most of it.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your prejudices and stereotypes interfere with the facts?
I imagine that the rugby LSE team is populated by former students from these schools for whom the rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, former private boys.
From very different backgrounds of those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
Are misogynistic jokes acceptable?
It looks like my university rugby club, I've never seen racist behavior, but naked races across campus, theft, property damage and misogynistic were all part of the game.
Not at all.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it in my last comment.
You can see it otherwise: say that your own body is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm going to win in serenity.
So then this interstellar cloud (or, not traditional:)
@lux You have not read the article well: a small half of your pasta water has more than 4.6 billion years...
Yes, well we can at least consider that the pasta fleet has on average quite easily over 2.3 billion years, which is not already so bad that this
A sacred foot of nose to the catastrophists and reheaters of any hair that predict us the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always exists.
There is irrefutable evidence that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What is proof that the warming stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological issues.
It is not a question for " catastropheists" as you say to worry about the dissipation of the oceans but rather about the reduction of human-consuming water reserves (you know the fresh water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And more generally, it is not climate warming that is the most threatening for our species, but especially the reduction of low or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly gourmet lifestyles.
As for the study you are quoting and making the generous effort to quote the source, there is little doubt of the truthfulness of the conclusion.
Regarding freshwater problems, I assure you that the French are far from being affected xD Then we must stop considering ecology as a perfect dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly (100% estimate for 2050 at the current pace).
Ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irrational ecology, not thank you.
"Then we must stop considering ecology as a perfect dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly" Yes, it's not like it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that by the action of the oxygen will capture the heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the process of greenhouse in an exponential way.
Has anyone seen any direct actions so far?
Or the slightest sign that 10,000 boys would come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could that be?
Probably not me!
In Abbott's little brain, perhaps sending RAAF to the Middle East is its version of direct action.
We're moving back, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot in the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% more CO2 than any climate model allowed gives priority to replanting.
It is logical not, since CO2 is the food of plants that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve flora worldwide.
It looks like this scientific fact has never been laid down.
Did you see the green army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument of plant food is only a fallacy distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of the biologically generated materials is perhaps carbon, but that doesn't mean that it's the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is fallious and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now invested where it will receive the most publicity to bring the Liberals back to the marginal electorate.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the prize of ignorance, brave champion.
SilverHead, when there's too much CO2 in the air, plants realize less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people must eat them in much greater quantities to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
That the Member of Parliament is clear.
To date, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from departing from the rules of the XVII.
However, to punish him and not Thévenoud, it is incomprehensible for not bad of the world, even if the AN regulation is not a tax treaty.
Let this lady do a whole deal of it is not to her honor, it appears above all as hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined everyone who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academia" had failed: "Let's say Mrs. the guardianship or the guardianship of the Sceaux" (which had never been occupied by a woman until then).
Pure machismo!
"Political arena " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The sand basin, the backyard of the Republic, the marigot of the gouts of the opera, the table of illusions, etc.
But the arena involves gladiators, people who take real risks, good grace, bad grace.
Qd the phallocrate officer is based on the label and parliamentary regulation by swirling the + basic civilization under the false umbrella in the right ways, the penalty applies to him "quality" for his partisan header and his mesus of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making provocation to talk about him.
So far he was unknown, now he can be proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class.
The academy on the back and we see that the MPs are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to focus on solving its internal problems and stop causing shells and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when it's done to her what she doesn't say.
This member behaves like a college student in the midst of adolescence crisis, who does provocation and whose friends go, in delegation, to see the Principal to cancel glue hours.
and defending it on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women do not even account for 15% of the signatories of this UMP forum.
Judge, I call on two expert witnesses only a few thousand years apart.
That's why I like to spend some time with the animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and appealing.
Dogs, dolphins, oteries, horses, all do stupid things for the simple pleasure that they get them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we are pushing the majority of our 80 years to work, move, and shop.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two our lives, but we spend the majority in the boredom.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion that anthropomorphism is.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try it again.
It's always an illusion.
In fact, "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates if the game is a race, an object to go looking for, etc.
It is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I adhere to the idea that we hear a lot of bullshit about animals that are "playing" while they are just communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "useful" (may be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber believes that "there is a principle of play at the base of any physical reality."
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her" Maybe yes, hope makes life...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, be healthy, and be able to respond to an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and would have the same tendency to be rather enthusiastic about those who seem crazy at first sight.
But when you see what many have taken from their school education, especially among the most likely audience to engage in attacks on women, my enthusiasm does not find the slightest beginning of anchorage.
"the most likely audience to engage in assaults on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we got it.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel pink, even if it doesn't necessarily match your thoughts.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iphone6.
Evry's crazy youth, too!
If the reactions no longer reacted, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I've never learned anything from this at school and I've never raped anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Should I love myself lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do we start reading life when we can't read?
And do young socialists go to suburban schools teaching gender equality?
It would be more effective than doing moralizing assemblies on Twitter, but you should get out of the beautiful neighborhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They are null everywhere but to teach moral lessons, it remains the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I still want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke here about using his bread.
This week's article's not going to be soft.
It's not time to joke around bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You made a double-sense word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a retirement home.
How does it get the more we pay, the less there's in the plate?
Because the quality of the experience does not necessarily measure itself to the weight or number of calories, as the quality of a film or a piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to make you buy more plates.
Of course, this is not the case.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you're still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more expensive you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child portion arranged with art in your plate.
At least they've been trying to put on nappes.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me that I should go to a restaurant in London...
Perhaps you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good dishes?
The Manifest for All is only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's right: some sort of homophobes gathering.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "child manufacturing".
A child must not be raised in a battery farm or manufactured by a technological apparatus.
Battery breeding?
Where do you get this from?
And if you challenge any technical intervention in the "manufacturation", it is necessary to demand the prohibition of WFP for heterosexual couples, it would be worth consistency.
I am surprised that the manifest "for all" still does not have this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
it is true that it is not the only cathos that manifest: other religions, also Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
That said, it is nevertheless useful to remember that these different churches were opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup rose violently against the willingness of the gvt to admit the girls to school in the name of "the family's defense".
We're still in the same pattern.
And, more recently, the same currents have screamed at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is the credit that can be given to the positions of these people.
You don't need to be a catho to get in the way of the marketing of belly and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom ceases to be the one of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have the same right to love each other.
But there is no question of tolerating that the child is a movable object.
And this is also valid for GPA search heteros.
I just can't just love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid grumbling stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
Moreover, I am sure that any other attacker, apart from Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many Peter Crouch goals would have been marked if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I can't disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals it has set, I won't talk about the other things it brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't bring or bring anything), but maybe this would be another reason why he won was much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 October 07, 2014 12:48 Recommends 119 This is the way to criticize Rooney at the moment so you can also be forgiven for doing so.
That said it is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and made 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
In fact, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridicule it.
I am obliged to ask myself if you really look at the football or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would have so many goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where Rooney's ability criticism comes from as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be selected regularly in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's footballer (even not an attacker) qualities to Peter Crouch's?
Are you doing that without a joke?
There's really people at the mass.
Please also note for your government that Rooney hasn't always been England's leading goal machine during his England team career.
Instead, he played the retired front, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players like Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written this in jokes.
In a country where the weapon port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people have a weapon, I find it totally schizophrene and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
Well, those in this school are just not at all in agreement with the U.S. arms port authorization!
The use of the pencil is still suicidal.
Stop the bullshit: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids do they play with fake guns at this age in our home?
Is that actually powerful murderers?
Even though the arms port is in the American constitution and it has a strong influence on the culture of the country, I do not believe that rich children are significantly different from ours.
A bit of good sense and reason kept svp.
It's a disarming process!
You've been locked up!
The information on this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl really has, or does not have at all, bite premiums.
Can we start from the principle that a serial killer can't already have a weird behavior at the age of 5?
If people need psy follow-up, it's more the mabuls of this school than the students!
Parents get their kid out of there: she's in danger!
I totally agree.
Those who manage this school are obviously completely ill.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the USA but is a part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
What is it about youth?
These glamorous blue ribs that men wear have nothing of an entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson bring at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a roller collared sweater.
I can't comment too much since I've never looked at this, but everything seemed so boring and soulless.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Opposite, maybe?
But what's so depressing?
You brought me in.
I would have thought a slight knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou does these days.
Perhaps by saying "ostrace", he meant "alienate".
It would be logical.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar was wearing a gray suit, we could go on to see that their intention was to ostracize her.
But here, no.
It looks like it's been corrected – weird. Maybe the whole sentence has been invented!
It's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he could say?
Probably nothing, but someone absolutely wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was "ostrace", which meant absolutely nothing to say.
The unemployment rate in the United States has still dropped in output, about 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Gas prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, continues to strengthen.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become "sustainable"?
In order to live there at the moment, I will say that the United States is gradually approaching the explosion as inequalities become crazy there.
The political system is literally rotten by the state of funding for election campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration are vast and unimaginable in Europe But Americans keep incredible optimism in the future of their country and their own!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago, the English financial community said France was lost.
Now it's the American who's at the end of his roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
One more of these articles that simply forget the essentials.
The level of consumption in the US economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and billboards could not yet give the change...
On the basis of the depletion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of the citizens, will "break up" or rather will bite.
I can't blame this Farration.
Will Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy to import compassionate voters from abroad is making him lose even more support at home?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continues with Russia.
Labour's shameful performance, Ed Milliband is in the moose, it plays at 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's massive immigration policy was designed "to feed the right-wing nose in diversity"
The Labour wins the partial election, the Tories lose the by-election in safe siege against ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same Multiculturalism that leads to this demonstration return, the pendulum has extended far since the end of the war, and I imagine that it will now go away in the other direction.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Labour Safe Seat, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for Labour it is a victory in the Pyrrhus.
Find the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used argumentatively against the word "defeated", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a win, but she's thin.
The Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a secure seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent no matter what wins in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not here.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ices of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia come from hard.
On the other hand, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc should not be considered as well?
In general, we need to see the Earth more "paste" or malleable than we can imagine.
Is that so?
A few small perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie speaks of a "simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the earth's crust, the pressure on the coat relaxes, which would give a) give a whip to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ????
In any case, either the "knocking" or the facilitation of access to the area will be localized (more or less).
Difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and inversely As for climate warming, it seems prudent to me to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, Patricedusud, does this volcano have an effect on our environment?
Does it have an effect on our climate warming, future or past?
Isn't it smart to stop warming up?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when he's last night, we see less well.
Good morning, the end of the last glacier period was also accompanied by a stronger seismic activity, including in the "active" mountain chains where on the highly glazed continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia.
Cordial CB
Too often it is not known that the earth's crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it rise or descend from some 30 to 60 cm, deferring, following its passage to the Zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This means that the sliding of the tectonic plates, as well as the tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving bag, especially as polar cassettes are lightened by the ice source, thus causing a change in the earth's balance to the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am enjoying this "human," saying the Supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commander, being ridiculed by his stupid action on the environment that created him and which he has so separated that he has become harmful, and to himself and to this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this nature that overcomes him in the organization of his own viscerals, by an invention that consists in finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, one another, mocking of collaboration, money.
The earth's crust is not based on magma, but on the earth's mantle, which is solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Ascent of Man from Bronowski.
Lively the next part.
Beautiful Wild1 story
Rather, it reminds me of a totally brilliant 2002 series called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers it now.
Too bad you've never gone beyond the first impression.
Your loss...
"The ice creams, our distant ancestors" You should look again at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you Brian
I am almost certain that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been realized several times, they always go to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I don't support this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to pretend to make an eyeworm in front of a brain in a mouthpiece.
And his story...
It must be hard for you, forced to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, you say.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be self, in itself, therefore non-conformity.
Of course, Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and its intellectual questioning expresses this advent.
But at that time it is just the premises that appear, today, individualism structure the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We're good at the individualism of "masse" !!
Without making an independable horizon, there is no relative to the Cartesian approach to examine what is to be believed, what is believed to be self.
More than rebellion, doubt is fecund.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter - reform!
By placing the problem at the level of its paranoid nombril, he blocked all progress and any reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reducing and reactionary vision that sustains: Behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right about this point and is anti-conformist, it is to fight against this decervelation.
Marcel Gauchet is being blamed for being a defender of order.
Excellent idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, ask some...
Black and red, the others.
Beautiful and robots, include the most followers of those who see themselves in their mirrors.
Thanks in any case to his controversial contestants to put under the light of the news Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persistent humanist, and so pedagogically enlightening.
David Cameron supports the increase in inheritance tax
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net value once he's no longer in power.
Business advice, speeches, consultation fees, a series of best sellers written by a black on "serious policy" – it will be £100 once it has passed the gun on the left.
Of course, he does not want inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as in the last election?
And the richest are those who will certainly pay the least inheritance tax through super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where heritage kills innovation.
It'll be £100 once he's passed the gun to the left.
Anything.
He's probably going to promise to increase the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say is worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Do you also think that Brown thought only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't choose him the last time, we had a coalition in place.
You could only allow him to be accused of lying if he was actually elected to power.
Just like the rest of us, Dave won't die "normally".
Climate change and impending collapse will end, both him and the others of his acabit.
His “richness ” will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded £1,000,000,000.
We must all be imposed to pay the essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I do not say that the discipline didactic is unnecessary, of course, I only say that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "insufficients".
Unreasonable statement for math teacher she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training for teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class knows no other approach than quantitative.
There are two possible answers, the 1st would be to select teachers based on their ability to impart knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she doesn't know how to act or react to work well => she's reduced to establishing a deficit relationship that makes everyone suffer in pure loss => it takes 1 training to teach skills.
A craft that learns, of course.
But pedagogy is first of all an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not making car parts.
The pedagogy doesn't get into an equation even when we're math teacher!
"Sciences of education" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently missing is a real vocation in bcp of those who kiss the teacher
If the gifts exist, the pedagogy (I prefer didactic discipline) allows those who are less able to avoid making mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective question.
The real unknown today are the students of which 1/3 tell us: learning is no good for anything I already know what I think.
A Slate article quite well describes the chaotic situation of this reentry.
Let's regret the old Normal Schools of Institutes..
It ends at 3 o'clock in the morning from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If it's true, it's good for her to use time anyway.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't suit me!
It's been years since his show started in the middle of the night.
We have this thing that's called iplaying and that allows us to listen to emissions on demand when we want it!
The Internet, it's pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio programs either.
I have a usb-type adapter behind my SKY box and which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seemed too complicated to me.
Yeah, I think I've been wrong in the hours, I had to hear Richard Lester at about three hours.
Although it's men on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least it would make people happy.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its emission is anything sensational disguised in debate, and it would be much better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of the regular animators, from Chris Evans in the morning at Simon May's show on the evening at the return of the job, is not a woman
It's going to be five.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows very well, but doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detached of these times.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a true journalist, but lunch keeps all the glacial air of a daily Mail radio.
I imagine he's calm, waiting for the current team to get married or get fired.
I was born in Soismos in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for FN.
For 40 years we have had the same two parties that alter the power and make the keys of the country to the other in less good condition than they have taken.
The campaigns are very poor, significantly poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
We need to make miles to find a movie, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn cars, don't get angry, don't turn around, they don't care about politicians...
But please don't mention a department where you haven't lived.
Yes, Doclocal, these are undermen, sociology is good to look at them.
They have a very high rate of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The FN thrives on human stupidity, culture and ignorance as much as it says it still has huge growth potential, it really needs to be bad for not doing better...
Today, the FN thrives mainly on poverty, the fear of daily life, the fear of the other and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
What a horrendous humanity.
Fortunately, there is a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and learned to save honor.
They've been looking for him.
Take the electors for c...
Here's what happens.
Who are they?
"forgetted" actually there is less and less resource =>low staffing.
This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen to you can't just "add and mix", women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by that is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being challenged, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles.
This makes it possible to recognize that women can work in the economic sphere and that is great - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will have a double problem, that is to say, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfil their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced my sister.
Economics and profits do not recognize gender roles.
Money speaks, and if a sex isn't high, next!
The profits make fun of the life you lead.
What are you doing, what is the advantage, and what do you have to offer?
The profits mock the heroism and the education of children.
If it were a crime, companies would listen.
Employer friends will never employ women between the ages of 20 and 45.
Well said, my sister.
It is very problematic that nobody talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social labour (most of which is done by women) must be equivalent to more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive sufficient support and is undervalued (not to mention that men do not do enough), but it allows us to run our societies and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find true "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to come back to the point of Msskayadee, how can we take account of the disproportionate responsibilities of women when conducting gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he'll help a lot of people who need to "carge a house."
The tiger is not Russian only Western propaganda.
The Chinese are solely responsible for the current situation and would do better to sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger on the right to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are simply in exercise near the border, long-standing exercises prior to the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no antiaircraft missile in its possession.
Free the Tigrisan!
You made my day!
Oh, yes, you do.
He came to me right away, the same kind of idea.
This is a pretext for arming some separatists to attach China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, it's China in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, beautiful flamingo and in danger of extinction ultimately turn into an article of betment directed against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is therefore not a leaf on the Siberian tiger, but a leaf on the suites of a Poutine com operation.
When you expose yourself to the media, you also expose yourself to irony or criticism.
The perpetual return of victimization of Soviet-Poutinian sympathizers.
Hollande had also taken her pear full with her camel without shouting in the anti-French plot.
There our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg Saint Protector of the Great Russia personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understood everything, he broke...
Holland's doing shit, that's one thing.
At first sight, it seemed to be an awfully condescending idea.
But, on the basis of the article, it seems to be both an answer to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find something to say.
And if only 53% of this sample were brushing the teeth before, and 73% later, it's a little empty sense to complain about paternalism.
After all, there's no disadvantage in brushing your teeth!
Indeed - in substance, complaints appear to be related to the fact that they are targeted towards the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that's true, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants that were provided by the Department of Labour and Revenue of the Ministry of Social Development for Young Persons.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a disadvantage in brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and stiff, it can sting the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember an show on the Guinness book of records where someone had tried to brush his teeth for the longest time and the Guinese judges at the time had strongly advised him to do so because of the adverse effects of frequent and prolonged tooth brushing.
At first glance, very funny.
It looks like an experimental design might be rotten.
The simple act of volunteering for this study will have changed the habits of participants who knew that toothbrush would be studied.
That's why most behavioural studies include things like double blind, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person who receives social benefits, there are two things that differ from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not give back information about when they brush themselves or do not brush their teeth (successful results from people who give their results based on perceived expectations).
Are there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in genome, but in gene expression, and that these inherited traits could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterine graft impact this phenomenon?
The nesting itself resembles a sort of graft.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we do not want to be born of a perfect clone of ourselves, is this a priori a problem?
It seems to me that it is going beyond the limit of the reasonable.
The desire for motherhood and paternity should not move ever further, without asking the question of ethics, risk taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, it is not without limits and yes it is sad and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they want to have.
This has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the tran
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go to risk and manage your little testicles to yourself alone, all alone in your little pants to yourself.
to "confer" their magic bag so that they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him in my safe if he could still give him love?
The current harsh circumstances make the PR FRYDMAN careful about his communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
Let us put it as an anti argument: see here these men's reactions curiously....
Marjane, any organ gifts don't have any anodin.
I've been a plasma donor for years, not entirely anodin.
I was registered as a spinal cord donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understood for both the receiver and the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow to judge in one sense or another or take part in this gift, but I will listen to women to speak about it.
@Margane: In fact, this has nothing anodin, and it strengthens the act of love that it implies.
Giving a kidney to a family member who needs it doesn't have anything anodin either, and that's done!
Please, no Messi v Ronaldo combinations.
It's down.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially since there's no really competition anymore...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
Sports has become a Yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second but they don't have the standard of the League.
Rivaldo was not part of the title winning team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Sportsman before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all the Real Madrid goals records this season so he can then go back to Old Trafford this summer with a quiet conscience...
It's hard for me to believe it.
I think Ronaldo will end his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment society?
I was looking at him on a fucking connection, so I can't tell you much if it's not that Valencia did well defend and without counting the possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid the middle of the field would get too fast, but they played well.
The game of Parejo in the whole becomes better.
A terrible penalty that was claimed but justly saved by Diego.
A mischievous Mestalla environment and it shouldn't have been funny for Atletico's bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the origins of mummification", well illustrated, appeared in the magazine Archeology 524 last September.
It's a good thing to have arguments to confirm and date what we intuitively get.
No wonder that before it got complicated, it was simple.
All science progresses by small steps.
And the "organ" of the woman who was thus preserved was?
Passionate!
Good morning and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me to read a few days ago that a mummie of black children had been discovered in the current Libya and that this discovery had opened new horizons, especially geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mummie was prior to the first African mummies known).
Do you have any information about this?
Thanks in advance.
She's a little uncomfortable with reading.
These may not be contaminations of modern times.
The desert at the time was not going any further than now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis moving to the place where there is only sand right now?
We knew the song.
And it is enough for a European scholar to assert it, even without evidence, that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it is not, and always, "of his ill-known foretastes."
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal free market quacks that preach against mobility of persons and for the mobility of goods.
I think that there are other people with Ebola and who the Spanish government is lying to us, not to give themselves a bad image and to protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But it could be that they remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same with regard to tourism, but the right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good for nothing and corrupt, like Madrid is not a very touristic place, I doubt it's their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that enable millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say, yes, it is important.
If they were to return the missionaries, I cannot see why they could not send them to an air military base and take care of them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy's mission was to dismantle the Spanish health service by privatizing nationalized hospitals, especially in Madrid, which is its base of power, until the courts intervene.
It's nothing but a right-wing in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's fucked up in the next election.
To be just towards Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he's far from his right and would well find his place towards the religious crazy right in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had previously descended to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European party from right to right in Spain.
These are cases apart, believe me.
The Spanish government is talking about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not succeed.
Excellent article but above all fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE employers - SMEs seem to read Le Monde to take time to condemn the words of the Pr.
Let's move on to the anti-intellectualism of the ambient era.
A professor of law at the College of France does not appear to be able to know the labour market unless he is a Nobel Prize in Economics and proposes to liberalise it completely
It was so much better before, that's true when Dr. Villermé noticed the work of 8-year-olds 10-days, when the Canuts were made out of sight because of a collective agreement signed.
Oh, good old time.
Your reaction is just as fascinating because of your ignorance of the TPE trade!
His profession is not to know the right in all his masters, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts on my youth salary bulletin, more than 100 information today!
Here is an example, one might mention a lot more, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, imposed without measure of consequences, and which choke the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbon client.
In order to draw the neck to the archi-resat argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code compared to the helve, a serious university would have plunged into the Swiss texts and would have compared the amount of official texts, and then the comment (the absence of the French Labour Code could mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By comments in a Code, whether it's work or not, it's aimed at jurisprudence in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for implementing the laws when a employee is fired, for example....
Who's complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, jurisprudence, conventions, contracts) are in the area of Work and Trade of Insufferable Barriers?

How long does that last?
Pullmann "Art has practically become immunized against criticism Mrs.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It is certainly time for new revolutionary nonsense to turn the criticisms around...
For every article on Ai Weiwei that I've read recently, you are among the first three comments that complain of its popularity.
Move on to something else!
Go see elsewhere, the choice is not lacking in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists that are not spokesmen of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced many good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think that the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraud, here's what you miss.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but you had to expose him (not making a bad word game at all).
It's the guy who blows up the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There is art, and then vandalism is seeking to attract attention.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy to occupy an elective mandate for extremists from all sides (including Zionists) must be removed
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have resulted in several judicial convictions, shame both Israel and Neuilly's mayorate.
He doesn't represent either.
Philippe Karsenty fights the truth alone, marginally.
WHO RESEMBLY IS ASSEMBLY
What does Neuilly City Hall expect to do against Philipe Karsenty, who is accused of a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls for an attack on this urbanist?
Crime apology?
I can't find Neuilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges??
This guy needs care, like Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the anti-Jewish/anti-Israel conspiracy theory and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most furious detractors.
As many people believe in any political decision to see the hand of the "sionists" (the meaning of which tends to disappear, because of its abuse), these two, in the same way as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe in all criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism "which is not without recalling the darkest hours of our history because it is still fecunded the belly of the beast my good lady would come back to Russia in the 19th century!".
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's reporting are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the plot on September 11 are of great stupidity.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the conspiracy theory of September 11, we are talking about cognitive dissonance about how to approach the subject.
Totally blinded by a totally tedious truth, having spent too much time, spent too much money to support it, it is unbearable to the adaptation of this theory to stand out (as in the case of extreme religious).
It follows a logical and inescapable flight ahead, the end justifies all means, even the lie, which is a common but comprehensible one does not seem to disturb the mission of the person concerned.
You advise to be careful and not to put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you do for September 11.
There is still a flurry of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudiens/consorts do not seem to be in a hurry to answer.
There are indeed very tedious theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need even more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its hour of judgment where the real harm it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is rising," but what requires (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
Sorry if you consider it an attack - will you drink a drink and relax?
It's better to risk that than to put my mental health at risk by refraining from me.
The government ends the fun when it costs him money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two average drinks per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote appears to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies that it is a more or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Council for Health and Medical Research should be in consultation (around one or two drinks, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now we're going to charge them thoroughly, like the smokers!
They already do it - soon it will be the grass!
My father wasn't drinking and smoking, and cancer took him to 64 years.
So I'm going to keep drinking my two bottles of red on Friday and Saturday evenings (and the other nights when my wife is not here).
Why is it that the Cancer Council encourages children to go to places where alcohol is used It is an old time that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What isn't related to a risk of today's cancer????
Sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not in good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
I refuse to run when we could run and reciprocate.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing-yes yes.
Both of them destroyed the F1 on a security basis.
Let's hope it gets better than Schumi or worse than Wendlinger was his accident in 1994.
Absolutely agreeing with you, but paying attention to point 1: this is not the F1, but the instances of the circuit that refused to advance the departure in order not to miss TV slots.
Totally accurate, +1
I just want to want a quick and quick recovery in Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, incidents that almost occurred between repair cranes and f1 were free warnings.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had been saying so for years.
How the hell did the race organization and the AIF allow these maneuvers without the safety because?
I can't accept that we invoke the risks of the job or the lack of luck when we haven't prevented the predictable.
But this accident was.
It must also be said, however, that there was a yellow flag, which not only means "a ban on overrun in the area" but aims primarily to signal a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunate that the family was supposed to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just raise their feet.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more sticky the next turn and the pilot, believing to arrive with sufficient margin, may even be "reduced" at a "reduced" speed compared to a normal rhythm.
Well, we're going to get into this void, until we've seen the images, we can't make an opinion.
I don't see much of what it changes.
Are there any wounded?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the info this morning before that happens, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe there are still jobs where we have to be on duty 24 hours a day.
I don't think people are hurt because Canada is almost empty.
There may be wounded animals like bears, washing mice, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population densities in North America and Toronto has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan countryside, trains do not derail like by enchantment and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains parade very, very often in one day.
In addition, as waterways often follow watercourses in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass through densely populated areas, because people always want to live near the water.
Also, all rail traffic crosses the center of a city as it was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is enormous potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a story about it last night, really shocking.
Did you obviously not read the article about the derailment and explosion of a train in a city of Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city long before the railroad.
That said, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
It may be that employees of the National Canadian Railway Society are expected to attend the next Hazardous Products Conference in Calgary in Canada on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees are long trained in the transport of dangerous products.
This article as many comments impasse the primary religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there can be no other truths.
The whole problem is there and the exegesis of theologians only reinforces this fact, otherwise what good is it to talk about the sex of angels?
"God said, it's good - it's bad" "it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).

Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in a certain way by trying to merge a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the strong Euro ( rather a milestone at the moment ) or that of the free market ( which is clearly supported by the state when it is needed to refinance ) ,etc .
Great ideas from religious backgrounds.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is at the tug and expresses itself in the schism.
Religion was born as the ideological support of the state, and the gods put to the service of ambitions even though it also carried forms of contestation.
Theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of time knew no doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a bad interpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts which are filled with explicit appeal to the hatred of the mediocre.
Rather, it is moderate religious (and fortunately they are the most numerous) who "read badly" the texts and hold only that which relates to humanism and values common to all humanity, atheists and various believers.
For me, fanaticism is the stupid and wicked application of passages of sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, certain verses of the Qur'an calling for the killing of "unbelievers", "unbelievers", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if one does not read a few verses above or below specifying that such executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a situation of self-defence.
on Yves Petit :" concerning the "foulard", it is a religious prescription that today makes almost unanimous in the "savans".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to get out of this is that it caused a general conviction.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same injury as the one shown in the clip?
Band of Neanderthalians surpayed and hypersexualized.

An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take your eyes off TV for a moment, you'd see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and stone made by its indigenous peoples and which are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema has produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me be of another opinion.

Almost all of the 331 dead since the ceasefire are civilians of the Donbass who have been bombed by the army, due to uncontrollable elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritically suggested responsibilities in the article without daring to explicitly designate separatists is on the line of the World that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the pro-European neo-Nazi Gentiles facing bravely the wicked Russians

I'm very good at this page on firefox and mac.
If I understand your story well, the wicked are his Ukrainians and the nice Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a bit communist by chance
Extract from the (very long) document you're quoting about MH17: "this ticket has absolutely no purpose to say that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent."
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
Propaganda?

From the Ukrainian army (he unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to him)?
Uncontrolled elements (possible to say anything)?
ALLEEEEEEEEEEYEYE!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez in Hungary!
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a Hungarian woman, on the other hand.
That said, I can't stand the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the power in place who has not stopped denigrating Romanian football until the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Cooperative" that decided before the beginning of the season what team would win the championship, what teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and who would whiten the money at his own will, mainly by selling players who were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was dealing with the above-mentioned officers and tried to avoid paying taxes (about one million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was ill advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have earned him a sentence without a penalty), and was taken as a result of three and a half years in prison.
The trial also came from the prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, star manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali also carries a penalty for trying to shake (and then conceal the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final game of the championship, so that he can win the title and win the jackpot of the Champions League.
The team he tried to blow were our neighbors from Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were relegated.
I'll always enjoy this time.
In the dissimulation of this attempt of corruption was involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed a false document as a witness that implied that the money the police had seized in Cluj was in connection with a sale of land.
So this poor uneducated guy, idiot, cheater and liar doesn't represent me, and he's never gonna do it.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalists today.
You might think that after the last time they broke chairs from the stadium and shop windows, and when they branded racist banners in their streets, they couldn't have tickets this time, but no.

Super article.
If Sarkozy had done that, we would have heard the left screaming like a big sick man.
But since it's the nice Hollande, friend of the unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but it's all low.
That is why the economic environment sometimes prefers a party claiming to the left to settle in power.
They are the bankers who have funded Obama's victory, and they have not been the fault of their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers do not seek work" LOL (no comment)
Should the job force generalize the control of unemployed early 2015?
I hope that in the whip, the tax pole, will also generalize the absolute control of the gougers commonly called plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrates, tax evasion, stealing patterns, and other Malandrins.
Can you make a sentence without the words banksters or plutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
That's true when we have class: we treat the population of lattice and toothless
In each new period of unemployment there are dozens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who most often do not even charge a receipt accused, he was automated.
It is also the total lack of follow-up or support from the Pole Emploi.
To conclude, I will add that this government's "socialist" patronyme appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read here an article of duck chained?
It is learned that a unemployed person may remain without news from his agency for several months, but that he must continue to seek employment by his own means.
It is learned that the controls have allowed people who for more than half no longer had unemployment benefits to be removed.
So we're wondering how people can be controlled that we've never seen.
It is wondered what sanctions represent radiation for someone who does not have access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if it can be admitted that this reform will allow for further clearance, one wonders why it will help recruits.
"It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to seek jobs by his own means."Effectively, it is shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Isn't it as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in football either?
Should we chase them out of the EU?
The EU was only economic-only and should remain.
The goal is not to be a "thinking police".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It has no economic meaning.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality???
The Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the arbitrarys of the corrupt mafia that is UEFA.
The best solution would be that all East leaves this lucrative organization rot and created its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This crusade anti-racism is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Currency and trade, rather.
European ideals for equality ?
So what the hell is Europe letting the United Kingdom in?
The Uefa should applaud them for enjoying Blatter's comedy and his men.
It's been happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Taken from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he expect to see himself twisting small symmetrical phrases, just history of keeping the controversy?
In any case, it is a fact that in every small event towards peace, there has been, there is and there will be people working to cast oil on fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli, and that this alone explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoding would be to say that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, it would be necessary to act against the overarmed Israeli state occupying under siege of the oppressive colonial destroyer.
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was not at all in the Shoah, it would have been more reasonable to empty the Bavarian of its German inhabitants (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been fair, the Germans had nothing to claim, and Europe would have kept millions of educated, enterprising and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr. Let's take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
Morocco is the colonialist, it's obvious!
But it is necessary, as for Israel, to question the history, its allies and its support to interview the truth.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaul was colonized by the Romans but at present there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is good discrimination based on origins.
Moreover, the Israeli state is defined as that of a "Jewish people" whose no non-Jewish people can be part of.
The Israeli state discriminates against non-Jewish people, from which the contentious.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, we must break with Zionism that opposes Jews and non-Jews.
In Maghreb, some peoples were even baptized in the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that must cease to be ignored.
First, the Zionist European project (colonizing the ownership of Palestine) involved dispossessing Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needs to be broken with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has missed biting from the start.
Their terne result will give them what their fingers bite.
He should begin his rehabilitation by small loopholes.
I hope he hasn't lost the appetite of the game.
So much solace is tolerated, including racial injures and physically hard spots in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what Purists say.
Yeah, I hate all those molars.
Football is a contact sport where the courts exist and, therefore, the players get hurt.
Getting his teeth back into the flesh of an opponent to have the advantage certainly did not have his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for having performed a similar gesture.
This is the third time that Suarez does this.
If you bite someone at work.
What would the consequences be to you?
I knew someone was gonna die.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm just slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this two-ball sarcasm.
I bet he was looking forward to playing with his teeth again.
All these word games on Suarez are losing their bite.
I almost died of bone.
A prerequisite for a good school course is the respect by students of their teachers and the school institution.
This works if parents instill respect for their children.
Parents convey this respect more easily if they feel that they too are respected by their children's teachers and schools.
In good establishments, those who advance their students, parents are considered partners, not as ems.
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do the whole job (teaching, teaching, learning respect, limits, living together briefly) It is for parents to do at least 50% of the tap.
But it's probably easier to take it from school.
Moving on parents is not operational.
No one really took on them.
The action will therefore remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could be a lot of things.
Operational and resident solutions.
It would be necessary for actors (profs, hierarchy and ministry) to play their role there and not constantly to reach out.
We can disband a troop that goes to relaunch it, not the families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the first role of the school.
Transmit knowledge.
And if there is a parent's requirement, the school provides education for their children.
What is the minister who will dare to put in place what was called the Public Instruction.
Disappointing article: little information, partial and destructed reflections.
Are you really looking forward to an intelligent comment from this beauty of the suburbs of the East?
It's a beauty, it's clear, but I think it's instead of Willoughby, and so on the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Let him fall and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
purely true
That's it.
A little Aloysius.
His electorate is Sydney North.
A North Coast beauf indeed!!!
Well, if British BBC viewers want to compare the neo-conservative governments of our two countries, of course they would conclude that they are led by the Party of Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
It goes for a gnarling, from today.:(
Yeah, but his leader leaves him on a regular basis on his hunger.
If you wake up one morning and re-assess that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these lawful and illicit life benefits will forever be out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He tried half to present a budget and then quit.
At least he doesn't threaten to beat someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and call for aid to the state.
And as she knows how to do lobbying, there's no fear of the result.
And so much floor for employment in France she has nothing to do, which comes from vegetables always ready to break when their corporation has losses on the markets, in particular outside...
This is precisely because their lobbying didn't work because the command was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the deadline or arrangement for marpol, there is no doubt that the project would have been completed.
After that, to find out if it's good or not and how BF is going to comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice that "the world" is looking at it!
The Brittany Ferries company is owned by Breton vegetables.
Those who burn the tax and dry centers.
They want state aid.
That they didn't seem normal to me.
Well to the extent that he is armed a ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes it's normal to wait for a blow from the state.
Or then it is condemned to tolerate the British monopolizing the market.
It's a choice.
The eternal French problem that views its maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where people sometimes live different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-lived ambition.
One of the reasons why Brittany must regain its sovereignty.
This is and after they will create the Breton Pavilion with crews exclusively composed of pure strain brakes.
That's for sure, they're going to bring down the costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They always hated everything related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which was always closer to the 70s Genesis spirit than those of other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of "distinguishing everything related to the prog", as they just broadcast an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career that would be "closer to the Genesis spirit of the 70's", I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a lot of songs from Genesis on which he had various degrees of participation and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to collect a lot of half finished demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett is asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely great, and in the spirit of Genesis of the 70's.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, be honest, she fears.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been realized if they hadn't had their commercial pop success in the 1980s?
I've still not seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have a story just as interesting but lacks the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good remarks.
I'd still say that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it's ADORAIT progressive music over time.
A person with a personal interest screams "prejudice": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a stunning success.
There will always be a difference between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his distorted understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so from the fairest and wisest vision and reflection of a society.
I mean, they don't have any excuses.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understood your point of view the first time.
That is precisely the difference, Mr LeClos.
It is necessary to have the spirit of the common mortals in order to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has done since his false sense of things.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, revenge in the relatives of the innocent victim: a false understanding that will never prevail for those who decide wisely of the death of others since the healthy and just reasoning of their pedestal.
However, to try to balance the analysis, it could still be argued that the death penalty, often, has exercised wild violence, which he has been able to enjoy, against land-friendly people, who have made it free of charge.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain mitigated with the disappearance of the one who was the bourbon, sometimes the tormentor, of being loved and who haunts their nights.
Let us not despise their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this thought that I find very fair.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he has great intelligence.
The one in the heart.
That's probably what I've read more just for a long time.
However, we would think that we would read stories of another era, of old things, that the barbarity of the past would excuse, and then here are the dates that ring, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
The same is true for the other two "Excellent American Romancers" mentioned here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all overrun.
I thought you stopped the whites, man.
What are you talking about?
Roth is great, better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is inconceivably better than this stinking Bellow, who received the price.
Perhaps this year's Nobel judges have decided that if we have to have an American winner, we could still have a racist [light].
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "geny novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homonymous Joseph, on the other hand...
Which did you read?
How many books of DeLillo the anti-DeLillo have they read?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, crazier, smaller Romans and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'll ever finish Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough DeLillo books to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...???
It's of simple interest.
It was a trait of humor, "law," not a demand for definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems so EVIDENT here that the lady acted in the only interest, and absolutely not in that of the institution she represented, that we are wondering what the term "conflict" is going to do.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll be very expensive!
Yes, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not warned him of danger.
After that, we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and seek only tranquility.
The inundable areas that become constructible from day to day the next day when a large construction program is going to launch, it's classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at alluvial plains near rivers.
We were told that "now, there are no more flooding through the regulatory dams."
Now you have to enlarge the retention lakes upstream and cross the fingers.
But it will be because of state services, of course...
On-the-ground profit, on the whole promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is it clear here, the interest?
Take out the calculator and you'll dream of the life you might have been in place of Mrs Babin, 1st Deputy UMP de La Faute sur Mer and former President of the Urbanism Commission, the one who gives them permission to build!
The 2 mammals of the triumphant Sarkozysme are the old and the real estate.
I'm left-handed and not at all friendly with Sarko, but svp, not low-political or low-ass all-zimuth, we're not in there in a battle of bridge balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. cops are hard criminals.
The US is a shithole.
So, what kind of shithole are you living in?
The U.S. isn't a shithole.
Yes, the American cops are hardened by the roots they're dealing with every day.
Of course none of them ever do anything but the cops "come and screw them up because they're racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the U.S., it's unfortunate that there's an incident like that to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
I don't know what you're doing here.
Good cops must denounce corrupt racist cops.
Sell them!
Do the calculation.
This kind of open racism doesn't exist here.
Is this the first time you've been in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant when in fact it's you who clearly don't beg anything - many sources (US resources) have noticed the perpetual problem that racism is in the United States (it's not an oysive speculation).
It is highly likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent of the tension in this area at this time.
And therefore, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in different ways, from which Occupy's treatment there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and shocks me with the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think the research journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to question the officials, talk to them, raise confidence.
That Man goes to the Elysée has nothing really surprising.
Then, what counts is the collaboration, the verification, the analysis.
And that's where we understand the sarcophagus have a concern to do.
@Munstead, our current president was elected on a wave of anti-sarkozyms based on cases of any coin (a non-place and no conviction) that appear to have been concocted by magistrates (2 referrals in corrections), two Dutch-friendly journalists.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executives and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, your partisan spirit blinds you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and not teleguided !!! ...
If you think that only Sarkozy's supports are unworthy!
From the extract I was able to read, the article of VA only rubs the drag.
I even laughed so bad it was rude.
For the rest, the world's complaint is unlikely to end because journalists are not "attracted" to the secrets of sources, is it not?
In contrast to the fact that there does not appear to be a conjunction between VA and power when there appears to be a conjunction between the power and the journalists of the world for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation of the World on the merits and its dangerous relations.
We are well at a state scandal which in any other democracy would cause the government involved to fall.
That is why this Aboriginal editorial, which says a lot about complicity with the current government.
It's not a left or right question, it's more serious.
I'd have thought the bee would go well with the smoked herring!
It's just for figures and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I'm sure if I was a second generation immigrant whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about immigration but that's no reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration program was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people who came in and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all co-operative, even refusing to give soup crumbs simply because of the lady's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship although she told him that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she wasn't a comfortable PAS"
As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - whoever imposes limits and contests it must be admired even if it is a director of the pub:) So much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left, it would be communist.
What do you think the New Labour has done that is particularly left-wing?
The liberalization of a country, NHS this NHS is repeated, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms to well feed the nose on the right), the culture of social benefits, the age of all-est-permits, the politically correct that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is a left-wing and non-communist center, I said that to joke, what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Drop your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I asked you, are specific examples of Gauchist policy, or a left-wing program defended by the New Labour Government.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked for, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour did that was particularly right.
He gave you his advice, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah - it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants coming to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to French!
S"was beaten in 40 45 to fall into another distancing, the money.
We're going to make great savings by flipping these technocrats...
We should renegotiate the treaties.
So, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" has yet another meaning in Europe, should it not do so?
Interestingly, the Commission does not consider the unfair tax competition between countries concerned with companies.
This must be negligible quantity.
Europe is not the solution, it's the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully market.
In term, this means that whole belts of French territory will no longer be served by the rail.
The abandonment that has already been suffered in many territories will only strengthen.
To sacrifice everything, including the vacuum of a country, on behalf of the liberal doxa, did not seem to me to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will need to be addressed one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to make the SNCF accounts clear.
The French state has resigned for a long time.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but not the means of forcing the sncf to meet its commitments.
But using public money without waste is essential for these days when public resources are being forced.
And the enormous needs.
I don't see very well what might be TER competition!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he certainly be head of rent?
It seems to me that you have not really been able to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, still coming to the end of pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would make sense to start the separation process between your life and the complications that you inherited.
Looks like it's what they do, but it sounds hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new ones are surfaced, have you thought about a "failure" "plan" so that you can make a break between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a bad effect, but with a compatible real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
It looks vindicative and persistent.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and to provide support to help it get back to work and pay for food.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My counsel, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises regarding contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will handle disappointment if he does not keep his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see you do this for their good, despite your own resentment because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a parent/child relationship, they will know who to thank when they are older.
I am of the opinion that children end up understanding who is wrong, if they are allowed to see things for themselves.
Go again a little effort you are close to the Godwin point.
In 30 to 40 years, civilization has disappeared, economic interests in the short term are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the iron pot.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that does in the least so-called social, fiscal but also environmental has an immediate competitive advantage, and the others are obliged to follow.
All the policies are looking for is growth, La Croissance.
There should be international coordination, but by then ...
It is not the climatoscopes that produce C02.
It is everyone who heats up, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in housing that he had to build well, those who buy industrial products that he had to produce and transport.
It's not the climatoscopes that showed against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climate-sensitive and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climatesceptives emit more CO2 than the others.
Environmental defenders also travel for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be sufficient.
Political action is also required (other sources of energy, reducing car dependence, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensibilities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is in fact a famous promise of McArtur made on March 11, 1942 at its departure in the Philippines.

Bingo of the Guardian: How long before anyone blames immigration?
I blame the crap that took all the money.
Do we count Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm claiming my $5.

Don't use the word immigration, you'll scare the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their hygienic basins, to bury 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (don't forget your wool and your bowl, which allows you to warm up, to extinguish the heating and to eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be such a jerk.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will lead Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a joke or is it not deliberately done?
It's more comfortable...
That's how public money is wasted to allow a tiny minority of individuals to spend good time in the space doing gallipettes and snoring while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
The reality of television has thus not been invented, and the authorities certainly expect a baby to be designed up there to ignite the world and to reverse media coverage to the western royalties used to the motherhoods of tabloids.
They might have to come back to earth and see that they're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, you don't send men or women into space to do chickens or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for mankind in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily lives are derived from space research.
So yes, it's money that's spent handy.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily lives and results from space research.
It's just a frigid gourd.
the ball pen that works in the air point (for writing to the ceiling for example)
To pay for his treatises?
To participate in the manufacture of an entire useless product?
Or propose how to make more money to investors?
In short, working for work means nothing to say and represents emptiness itself.
Ah if the last play high tech.
Behind the tiny minority of individuals who go into space, there are tens of thousands of others who work to make that possible.
You know, people who drink what, of which more and more private companies, especially to bring the cargo to the station.
If you're thinking of buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think about buying plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy plastic gun in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to impress people to make them think it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
The plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, would it have hurt the author/editor to put a picture of the "sword" in question instead of generic pictures of "plastic swords"?
Or even be curious enough to wonder what the inscription meant (if any) that was on it?
Bad typical reporting, we're slowing down the fact that "it's only a plastic sword" and not the inspiring jihadi text that's written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of the Shiite Islam.
The family of Dirani, on the other hand, is Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups seeking to overthrow governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped scratching on the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be deadly.
Even the little blankets that we give in the quick remains can perch the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridicule that the author gives it.
It is not worth trying to make a "ha, ha, a sword in plastic", the facts as you have stated support in fact his argument.
On occasion, I saw these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they had never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it makes all the sense now...
I saw this guy who looked like he was from the Middle East in Kebab Stop and was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night!
I love the conclusion a lot.
All the wonderful new developments, often technological, give many people the idea that it is a right and a need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a standard cost (subscription, electric consumption) that they weigh in the budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies results in frustration.
For example, use the Energy Solidarity Pact, which allows you to isolate the combs of a house for a symbolic €1 when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are borne by the energy providers in fact!).
Simple effective but unknown even though more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting to this PES.
But never heard of it.
Who can call it, and how does it work?
For information 60 million consumers, water-saving showers test and recommend the placing of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 / year to 100 m3) to 50 m3 of water savings per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
It's not a demand crisis, it's a system crisis that can no longer produce enough surplus (which would then have redistributed in the form of real income increases) so that these surpluses pay the increase of the expenditures you call in the category "constricted spending".
In other words, energy insecurity is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy can no longer grow as quickly as it wants it.
Note that the economy's (neo-)classical theory is totally incapable of responding to such a question, because for it, there is no inherent limit to economic growth, and there is no element that can push, increasingly decade after decade, the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what enables any physical transformation.
Since production is essentially transforming energy, it is possible to achieve less economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more we need energy.
This means that any upward constraint on energy generation (i.e. "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn forcing production to rise (except to improve energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy insecurity and the fact that we arrive, or not, to increase the "production" of cheap energy.
And the very officially published data, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only get worse in the years and decades to come (the IAEA, in these recent reports, clearly indicates that the production peak of conventional oil, understood, was achieved in 2008 at low prices.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job, whatever performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring things back.
Take this from France!
Vote No. 18.
Are you a Guardian webmaster?
That's how it was noticed before: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Yeah, nice work, guys.
Although many English people like to mock Scots when they just lose, there's nothing to say, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they get to qualify, at least until they get eliminated in the first round.
It's even more ridiculous if we play against them;)
England is beginning to worry me.
Because now that the "golden shige generation" is withdrawn, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole, and David Seamen back in the XIs, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class", is David Beckham, a little frightened, maybe, but I think if he hacked a potato in overweight like me, he would crush me completely.
People forget their athletic constitution, by speaking of athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney... ?
I never make fun of Scots.
I tend to surprise myself by looking at their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class" is David Beckham
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It's about that Juppe would have had a hard time asking for 100,000 euros for a South Korean conference.
And not that he would get them if he asked them...
You mean, people come here for a good shot?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on his MPs' allowances...
I ask myself, above all, the question of what he can say at his lectures.
How to reduce the deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious speaker of a scientific discipline, regardless of his scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will not think of asking for the least amount.
Conferences with content are most of the free or almost free time.
And I can assure you that these young people actually work and that the results presented in their - free conferences - are real.
At the time of the limitations on the research budget, the reporting of these two figures is upbuilding.
Researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
I mean...
It's all light for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the Ethics of the UMP
I feel like he's being blamed for making money???
I'm far from being one of his fans, but he's being blamed for being ill (or fraudulently) managing his campaign OK.
But making conferences seems to me to be a completely legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let's remember that her travels are supported by taxpayers.
Epidemiology Rule 1: to be isolated.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than politically correct.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What density of population infection will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola gets worse in West Africa, I can see them banning all flights and boats to the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods that said...
What a shame the international media panic about Ebola is no longer being used to talk about less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting people in West Africa.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It is a news article so sad, so big a title so small.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first donors of care - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc., etc.
Such smarter comments could have been made on how, why and where we can all contribute to better understanding and interpreting cultural and sociological approaches, and gender differences that could help to combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's get into it, let's think and write, we're not just making noise.
There's a time for everything.
If you are unable to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, perhaps you should just think before you write?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same rank as beheading - a form of terrorism as barbaric, its survival rate only making it a different form of torture - to say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" overhearing.
In fact - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case it obviously gives no better perspective than that of a average activist on the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was "growing" as a global resource of journalism - advancing in the 21st century, abandoning his founding precepts.
Who, in the editorial team, let it appear?
For a territorial electorate or other money does not count.
I read constantly that the territorial public service is increasing its staff, and I have never seen any article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
This would be legitimate , indeed .
There will probably be lies and truths, to separate the good grain from the ivy.
The Court of Auditors is expensive to tell so many economic naïseries.
It's true they never had anything to manage the people on Cambon Street.
TCs are not in deficit, they have funding needs that can only concern the investments they make.
It has the power to use concepts that are too vague in the press as the World plays the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, debt mainly finances operating costs...
And as the over-embaldancy of officials (for making beautiful round-points for example) results in an increasing and incomprehensible burden (compulsory charge up to their deaths, as life + retirement work), these communities are large in investment.
The status of civil servants should therefore be abolished, prior to the decline in staffing.
And also responsible the mayors financially.
This is fabulous, intercommunals would have to be accompanied by a drop in community staff and it is the opposite that occurs, proof that adding one level is not effective without removing others.
How do you want to properly manage large territories like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse when these territories were created is over, perhaps it would be time to react.
They wouldn't prefer to be jailed, even worse, in the administrative canvas, they'd look like!
Let's try it even garroted, it's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the Vème state has led with its providential men.
It actually started with Pétain.
Then he went on to finish the series "at the end of breath" coming loudly about.
Why aren't they going to live in a 250 million-dollar apartment in Monaco over a movie to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the type "It's white fault".
"answers" not "answers"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry up to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to make.
We now agree that the Modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and for a particularly wet period about 150 thousand years ago, they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight miles) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence had stated a few months ago that no military hospital would stop.
So he lied.
He was probably the only one in the government who seemed to keep the road.
Now, we know we can't trust him anymore.
I quit!
2017:Transformation into a comfortable, special hotel of golden closets for future retirees of the Republic?
Moving from the dedicated floor to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the nantis and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money, and the military are going to treat the flu of the little one elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all horizons?
The London Wasps?
I was sorry about their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They left London last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the ground of a rugby club instead of the reverse.
In addition, travel outside for the Tigers and the Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the trouble of being bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I was gonna say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they had access to other premises, did not do us any good.
I love supporting Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a lot of supporters and that was up to recently at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage taken by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent problems with the CFCC, but that must be a good gifle.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest I don't know anyone who doesn't do it except a few Wasps fans at work.
Are there thousands of other people in the South East who will probably follow them from far away or will they now have to support another team?
Nice pro-domo article and good vulgarization.
Who cares?
But then why are ALL computer systems not based on these concepts???
+because a huge mass of pre-existing programs (cobol, java), +because all systems do not require them, +because there is no magic baguette ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs aren't really important, what counts is to be the first on the segment.
The work of G.

But they don't sell.
Real-time computing has become a key sector in many areas, and few people are aware of the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been to an Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There's already too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
Looks like they're reasoning with Fairys more profits, and not making healthy dishes and the best price-quality ratio.
They take us for pigeons.
Oh, yes, be careful that people don't have too many chips.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the true ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you have to add to the water of pasta is negligible, but it greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It's not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way the pasta cooks.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Each should try alternatives to business cuisine.
Are there any family restaurants and are they offering tasty dishes at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A banal job accident that went wrong.
A promising young man, learned to steal, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man has spoiled everything and brutally interrupted this vocation birth.
To be sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where are we going?
I totally agree!
How humorous!
The desire to cut them off is obvious and hardly excusable and humiliating at once...
Indeed, the desire to cut them off is hardly excusable.
That's what makes me a little sympathy for a 15-year-old.
During the trial the child's father complained that he never saw his son again, but without apologizing to the relatives of the guy he himself killed.
Who's really a victim in this story?
What do you see mixing everything!!!!?
The boy's father was convicted for what he did.
With regard to the bullshit of the lost bullets, the accused and guilty, he knew that the bullets were dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the accused!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible for!
Ten years, that's a little much in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot this young man to make noise?
Well, actually, that made noise!
If you have the opportunity, go on vacation in the Mosule Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small wine growers.
It's been twice when I do it, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
Moreover, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals that are held in each municipality, it is even better.
I'm sorry, the Moselle Valley, I hit too fast.
It's nice to see that German wine is recognized.
Rather important, German vineyards traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations do experiences with different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
There is not only the Moselle region to be recommended - the Franconia, the Palatinet rhenan (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are German-styled (or perhaps the reverse, in brief).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot, and with a much higher alcohol content than their 9 preferred grades.
But their traditional wines put in a bottle at the property are so complex, the softness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad spatlese with a lobster thermal next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine of Hugh Johnston is a great guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand that there will be new Guardian readers who discover the wine, but this is a summary of every newspaper article on German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article on German wines that are coming, the new Baden sects that are now going to accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drink when they were young (heu, I really don't think it's always true or evocative, except if I address myself to over 40 years - who, as I say, will have seen it all).
Closing the Val de Gracia would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the lamentable state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-grand uncle who did their studies there.
In democracy, public health management should be put to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: these calls of ministries held by the barbichette, and those decisions taken in private, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin's right.
It should be done as in Soleil Vert: euthanasia at 70 years of age.
Moreover, we could sell the meat that will feed our poor (sic) assets, since they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find work for our unemployed, real work, and you won't have any more deficit problems!
For the elderly, the time has come to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, in the process of disappearing, will not be able to keep this demographic transition alone...
So of geriatrics, of course, but to think otherwise of a hospital model of the 30 glorious.
Now, the maximum growth to 1.5% (this has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole model defined after the war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that was best known in public hospitals.
If this symbol falls, we're really fucked.
First we're fucked because the rest of the hospitals aren't high.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites are being treated elsewhere than at the public hospital.
The solution is more likely to increase public service supply in other hospitals than to maintain a two-speed medicine.
The Val is a landmark of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
Closing would be a mistake, a sign of more of the march towards the mediocrity of France.
Not to mention military status, which must be kept absolutely.
"The Hospital Day Award", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Ministry with local oversight of the Regional Hospitalling Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is just one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia for a better job than he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country to two non-citizens parents is almost always non-citizens.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian residents of citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious consequences.
Why??
It seems to me to make two measures.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to end all persecution and abuse and war that drive people from their country away and force them to seek help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then we need to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I don't have to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country returned to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron did not believe in this small supermarket when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and the ill-treatment that still took place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of Tamils with links to the LTTE, thinking that they would be at risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its asylum assessment guidelines in December 2012, and recommended that persons with links to LTTE be considered at risk upon their return.
The year [2013] saw an increase in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr. Nowwak, you've gone the coconut with such a periodicity.
In fact, this guy couldn't get you a chance to make it.
Did't I have a health insurance in the States?
So I wouldn't have been given giving any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical spends during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes tera.
Especially in Texas
Ah ah ah !!!
There was still little, we were told that the Ebola kills so quickly that an epidemic of great magnitude was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the question, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of the people brought back was zero.
The weirder we're feeling, the more scared I am.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be null.
Low or even three weak but not null.
Finally, this is a scientific fact, the more a virus is fatal quickly (generally) the less likely it is to spread because the death of the host indicates its own death.
The combination of 2 (high transmission and fast death) sometimes comes out of the Spanish flu.
After that is the 40th general to save humanity..
Is there not something oblivious to mediating certain brave and virtuous Westerners, but to the detriment of the thousands of other African ills we know neither the trade nor the bravery nor the virtues?
Of course, this highlights the work of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repetition of the announcements is of a terrifying bias.
Freedom of expression, so dear to the Conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms attacking the freedom of expression and the right to privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative penchants would have stripped them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heat tower for when the problem really becomes out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like that.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy of medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Medical Research Final Market Fund, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be a black cashier for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, he will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope that Australian voters will come to see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe.
He explained that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Term Market Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly, and a loss for the low-income.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, the "rongeur menteur" and its Telstra final market fund were excellent tutors.
If it's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell for the next election.
The most terrible thing about Nadine is still the "old personality", delicious....
I also noticed it, pretty corrosive as I noticed.
If only she could dissuade her from keeping a buzz on it constantly..
The worst fate for a career policy: not recognized on the street.
Hello She has not been recognized in her city of Toul as being high enough to administer it.
How good is the common "provincial" sense!
We live in a hateful time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course I'm against the port of the burqa, but that's not the question.
What this anecdote tells us is sarkosism in the pure state: poor minors with rank of ministers, confusion between the function of government and the function of execution (if Sarkosy could come with his tone on every road accident to show that he is well-guarded of public order), severity and carelessness brought to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "old personalities" who have become disappointed to carry a firearm and a badge, so that they would have every opportunity to exercise their self-proclaimed function as judges.
But who is Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main lesson in the case: even the police have turned Sarkozy's page, perhaps they don't even regret it.
He really has to stop before it gets awkward for him.
I sent this agent who was unaware of Nadine Morano's existence, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the blow
Don't agree, thanks to her we laugh well ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, she should be invented!
But it's easy, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
This time, N.
Morano clearly did indeed in contempt, in contempt of the police officer she had before her, and who would have probably multiplied the curves and the "Yes Madam, of course, Madam, at once, tell me in which direction I must run to capture this veiled woman without waiting."
"In one of the cases, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too important..."
The Americans are not bad at this, but I still think that Isis is going to overcome them or have already done it, in Iraq at least someone was counting the bodies right here no one does.
As far as industrial civilian deaths are concerned, nothing rivals the Western war machine.
I do not agree, the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between the two Iraq wars would have cost millions of Iraqis, especially children, the elderly and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war demonstrators I knew preferred sanctions for the removal of the "war machine".
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred the sanctions to the order and to the men on the ground?
Very good remark - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and inconsistencies in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - no doubt a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents have not wasted time to mark their main enemy when they saw him in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the UN Mission's GQ that they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with strength and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and hard this bombing either, I was surprised by people's shock to know that a United Nations mission has been targeted like this.
Good point, I really forgot that.
So add half a million people to the total number of deaths from Western nations (at least with recent disturbances in Ukraine, economic activity was directly directed to people they intended to hurt).
It does not help your argument only to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only vaguely reliable figures on sanctions-related deaths are those of children under five years of age and they are even very suspicious because Saddam Hussain refused to let objective inspectors see the facts.
It was obviously in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable believe that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are not better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanctions deaths in less than five years of age was approximately 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths is largely partial to this age group.
Of course, you need to fear it, but also the gift of gametes in general.
We must stop to act as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that the children needed, and that we could do it with strangers that neither the parent nor the child may ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French are genealogy.
It is an essential and despised thing to know its origins.
Instead of making it as if it were obvious and using fantaistic arguments, we should explain what serious problems can happen for an adopted child or designed with gifts of games.
If you learn that the parents who raised you did not provide the games you were released, you could, in my opinion, give them back because they would have committed no crime.
The latest advances in LDCs (e.g., uteros) are at least as questionable as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me: the frustration of the desire for children justifies these acrobatics and that has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Just like a point.
Obviously, we have to be afraid of the GPA, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad that you can't have a child when you want one.
It's a problem I've had with my wife.
But anyway, it is less serious than being born very disabled or becoming, contracting a serious illness, losing all of his children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life, it is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
This does not stop us from living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes well-consuming, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a whim where one could use the other according to his or her good will.
Sterility calls for reflection and acceptance.
