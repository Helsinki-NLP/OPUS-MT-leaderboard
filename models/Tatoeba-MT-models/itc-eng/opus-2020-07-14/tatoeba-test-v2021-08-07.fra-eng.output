White pion to f3, black pion to e6, white pion to g4, black lady to h4 - chess and matt! That's what we call it by joking in the chess circles the "mat du mad".
White: turn on a1, pion on b6, king on c8. Blacks: pions on a7 and b7, king on a8, mad on b8. Whites put the opponent on zugzwang by playing the tower in a6, after which the blacks only have two options: take the turn on a6 or move their crazy towards any other box of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and offer failure and matt. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black on a7, with the same result.
