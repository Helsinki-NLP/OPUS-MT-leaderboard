This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely widespread, but gives more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown brown at the top, with pale or carotenoid colouring at the bottom.
The discovery also allows for detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
As the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachide, but has other typical characteristics of feathers, beards and barbules, researchers have concluded that rachide is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.
The piping structure makes the impression that it was not used for the flight, but rather for the regulation of the temperature or for the courting. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the repertoire shows an adult plumage and not the chick plum.
According to the hypothesis of researchers, despite the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a plumage from an adult and not that of a chick.

The bill provides that on violent video games sold in California State is a label with "18" written and makes it punishable for sale to minors with a fine of $1,000 per violation.
This morning the public prosecutor, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement that both Huhne and Pryce will be accused.
Huhne has resigned and will be replaced by the government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to play the role of Minister for Enterprises left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Court of Judges is scheduled for 16 February.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old.
Edgar Veguilla reported injuries to the arm and the jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider must undergo a face reconstruction surgery.

Schneider witnessed through video conference from a USF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo took part in two single championship races.
The first in slalom, where at the first descent had a DNT recorded. Another 36 competitors in 116 in the same race did not complete the test.
The other race he participated in, the giant slalom, saw him ranked as tenth in the female group of the "seducted" category, with a combined travel time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first ranked, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants at Slalom Giant did not rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to retrieve the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.

He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Cambridge Hospital.
From that moment on, Adekoya is at the court of the sheriff of Edinburgh with the accusation of having killed his own son.
It is held awaiting referral to trial, but any testimony by an eye witness could be polluted, since its image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University, "journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects walk on a land of interest."
The Crown Office, which has the general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has specified to journalists that no new comments will be issued at least until the formal indictment.
According to the wording of the document, the issue will be the dispute over borders, that Palestine wants to be based on the boundaries existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement has been signed, Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental programme for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received training and comprehensive safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly took a oath in a new Voluntary Electoral Council (CEP) made up of nine members.
This is the fifth interim electoral council of Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed a package of measures to push the country into new elections, including resignations from the previous CEP.
The committee set up the response by Martelly to the widespread protests, which started in October, which challenge the regime.
The occasional violent protests have been triggered by the lack of elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which have caused a total of six fires and caused small wears to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) said they were aware of 27 incidents related to devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
In his reply, the ministry called "absolutely enforceable" the postponement of the report by Apple.
The earthquake at Marianne was warned at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).

And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of tsunami being carried out.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took hostage to the tourists of Hong Kong after he took their bus.
With his M16 Rolando Mendoza rifle he set fire to tourists.
Many of the hostages have been saved, at least six have died.
You are hostages, including children and elderly people, they were released immediately with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was hit dead.
Liggins went through the father's footsteps and took on his medical career.
After following the training in the obstetrics, in 1959 he began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black scales' with flight records.
His companions of wrestling also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dremer said, "The Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons, unique, just like her.
"Luna was weird like me... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... we hope she's in a better place," was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, the people opposed the transition from Australia to the republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the Acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated that Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the survey participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In contrast to the survey, 29% of respondents argued that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% felt that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal should have won in the 100 and 200 meters free style and in three staff at the Commonwealth Games, but he accused several disturbances that led to doubting his physical shape.
He could not take the drugs needed to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known until today.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that have led water and organic matter on earth, that is, the matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets are formed, and in particular how the Earth was formed, being challenged with comets a long time ago.
Man, 53 years old, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he has signed his signature on a law that makes marriage between people of the same sex legal.
According to him, speculations are nothing more than "claws and political hatreds."
A candidacy is assumed for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of obsolete ground radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide the drivers with more accurate information.
Additional transport is not being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while car parking is not available in place or interchange parking.
Fears related to the absence of means of transport have revealed the possibility of having the party competed at closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published on Thursday on the journal Science, on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador a new species of birds would be born.
According to researchers at the University of Princeton, the United States, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was considered that the time needed for this process was much greater; this was due to the coupling between an endemic fringe of Darwin, strong Geospiza, and the fringe of the immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can be rounded to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable to be trimmed and intertwined. It can be hammered or rolled in wool.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the pictures painted by hand in the books called "mine codes" just because of the possibility of being so subtle.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how much acid is or basic (alkaline) the chemical element.
The pH level of the chemical analysed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H letter of pH).
With hydrogen ions we mean protons that have been ripped off by electrons (as hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, stick them in a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers there will be a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and will form a sort of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with current water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, the houses of the mining cities of Crete and Santorini have been discovered remains of sewer nets.
The old cabinets also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. Roman civilizations were sometimes included in public bathrooms, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone a thousand miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost immediately.
The launch of the satellite in space was made with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry in space a satellite or a telescope you need a high radius of more than 100 feet.
The wheel has greatly changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important thing is to provide us with easier and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium size felines that feed on medium size preys, which vary from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small feline (including free domestic cats) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every cat has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social feline and live in numerous groups called branches.
The branches are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 separated from each other, and by a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely taught with each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The white of lions acts in a very similar way to the white of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other great feline), even with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not too well), swim, jump very long and exercise a force of traction five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the Panthera genus) of the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four feline are the only ones to roar.
The thunder of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it resembles more of a phrase of screaming and angry words.
The birds love to feed on small animals. If possible, they go hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the animals follow and find the animals to eat (prede) thanks to the smell, boiling on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as be able to move furtively. To hunt their prey, the celelotes blend with the surrounding environment and then plunge them over.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population to which they belong (for example, if they move beyond a mountain or river, or they move on a new island, making it difficult to return), they will probably find themselves in a different environment from what they were before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, in order to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than previously required.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
With the passing of time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it is increasingly less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they will no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb carbon dioxide ejected from them (through the breath).
The plants develop their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shades.
We build our houses from plants and produce clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants the animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of his age and therefore feared nothing, except the other mosasaurs.
From its long faucets came more than 70 sharpened teeth like razors, plus a further row located on the palate, so for whoever crossed his path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had the biforcuit language. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mossauri and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also provided for different strange or unusual flows, such as the boar, the peacock, the snails and a kind of rodent called the oak.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting on the chairs, rich men loved to feast together while lying on one side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of ancient Romans did not include different foods, which came to Europe from America or from Asia later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for every deity a main temple, which was considered the habitation of the god.
People were offering sacrifices to the gods and priests were trying to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurata, were built, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a shrine dedicated to God.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was open.
The women cooked in the yard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the northern sage it is said that Erik the Red gave her name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimos tribes were already living there.
Although all countries "scandinavian", the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the film "The mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is drawn a map of the treasure.
However, this is false. Although on the back of the document there is something written, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the written "Declaration of original independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down to the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the wide parchment document (measure 29.75 inches per 24.5 inches) has been rolled up to be restored.
Probably, then, the annotation was only set as a label.
D-Day landings and subsequent clashes had led the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940 the Allies invaded South France: this offensive action took the name "Operation Dragon".
The American forces and those of the Free French had freed the south of France in just two weeks and headed for Germany.
With civilization we mean a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn linked to "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in a certain way therefore defines the size of society.
Cities-state are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means conveying knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving important historical traces, not being so recognized as true and own civilization.
During the war of independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and the Congress was the only component, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of a national executive or judicial power, it was entrusted to the State authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of their own acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
In order to amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was needed, and they had so little consideration of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football national is, together with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and the FIFA World Cup was awarded in 2006.
Among the most popular sports there are: football, basketball, volleyball, basketball, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, hockey on track and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and they see Italians engaged to compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of Japan almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, it refers to Japan as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when the European sailors who were passing from there slowly recorded the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The East Indies Dutch Company in 1624 establishes a base in the south-west part of Taiwan, beginning with a transformation that involved the production systems of aboriginal cereals and taking Chinese bracelets to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared the province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the first so-called "Sino-Japanese War" (1894-1895), the Qing government signed in 1895 the Treaty of Shimonoseki, thus giving in to Taiwan's sovereignty in Japan; the island will remain under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, and in particular the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site was recovered, but restoration work is still under way.
The most common format in the world for picture photography, for example, is the 35 mm, the same of the film most used on the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the size 35 mm is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (deviding for twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the family of APS formats) are equal or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often derisive third party rule is a simple guide that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of lines that divide the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a binder between the European States for over a thousand years, despite the language and costume differences.
His omnipresent power has affected anyone, from the king to the ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary reserves of the church exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of the hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite the violation of international law usually accepted and codified by many international treaties over the past two centuries.
Great Britain reduced international waters to prevent the access of any ship to entire sections of the ocean, also endangering neutral vessels.
Since this tactic had provoked a limited response, Germany expected a reaction similar to its indiscriminate underwater war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and efferatities of the first world war, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla accepted a job offer from Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or any family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most well-known was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these times, fierce wars were fought by many nobles in the battle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all the candidates men, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since army classifications, instead of being class-based, are now based on calibre.
The French Revolution has also been a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their revolution.
Maometto was deeply interested in issues that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which survived the passing of time, offers itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave lies on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
It's not really easy to find, even if you knew about it. Once inside the cave, isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has come to our day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, hosts many pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheope), several smaller tombs, various temples and the great Sphinge.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "arranged up" resembles a V and the indication "arranged down" to a graffiti or a square without the lower side.
Towards the top means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start from the alamero (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc is a stronger and more determined sound.
You may decide to add your custom pencil indications, but keep in mind that the signs of the archeage you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women in the corner of the market, King Luigi XVI, in a terror trap, left Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Mary Antonietta, to their two young children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old and Luigi Carlo, 4 years old) and to Elisabetta, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep the windows of their carriage clear.
At some point someone among the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism supported to conquer the Philippines were paid by Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover much of the expenses and interest in bonds held in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains resulting from the exploitation of the Philippine people in their time constituted profits at the basis of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The time when events took place is commonly called the Upper Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the XI, the XII and the XIII century (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Middle Ages and followed by the Medieval Bass, which ends by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense that the fate of man is driven by a logical solusant, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network only for a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are developed to reduce the costs related to the ownership of a car.
Car massing also leads to a greater percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new relief techniques for the care of injured persons.
Romanticism was characterized by a strong component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time there have been uses, customs and culture linked to this geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective results of the laws imposed in an arbitrary manner.
Similarly in Paris, known today as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
His fame as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued around 1100 AD.
During the 12th century his prestige was diminished, especially because the Crusades returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of capital of fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was touched in the period between the X and the XI century and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing has the strong influence of eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of the lines of communication means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the crusades, was the introduction of the buttons to tie the clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced solely in order to produce enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of a biological type, which uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at obtaining the maximum from crops.
Historically much of the farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures combine individuals with the same views, which do not feel representative of society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of its members.
The characteristics that define as distinctive a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes modes, manners and argots.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialisation is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who because of neglect, as a result of misfortune, or because of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialisation with adults.
These children are called "ferrets" or wild. Some of them have been secreted by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children could have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully raised by non-human animals, it shows behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference to man.
Project-based learning should make learning even easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a little further.
Caffolding is not a way of learning, the more help for those who undertake a new learning experience, as can be the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Caffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffiding", but it is also the small assistant in the form of Microsoft Office graffiti.
Virtual cauffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, solicit and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing alone.
Children are given credit for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee food, care and training, but happens to them.
We believe that the trust represents a safe area for these children.
Our trust system should provide safe homes, loving trust parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trust is supposed to meet all needs not met in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use theory and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995) are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet.
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relations".
The use of video recording has made it possible to arrive at significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements of the duration of a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying about interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The Speech of the President," Oliver Sacks described as people unable to understand the language spoken because of brain damage, however, they are able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even maintains that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century the research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, that is hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is removed from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability forward and backward between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive device similar to that of human beings it is difficult to satisfy their needs of amino acids with the vegetable resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, in the end, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and vegetables, but for the primates like us are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In the light of all this, it should not surprise us that our ancestors themselves have resolved their "protein problem" in a certain sense as the savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional awakening process that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice using a relatively silent awakening to bring you to a state of consciousness, without fully waking up.
If you decide to reset your watch in your sleep, you can put it from the other side of the room, so you'll be forced to get out of bed to shut it down.
Other options focused on biorhythm include the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force them to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his or her body and spirit.
Minor is the tension, the more positive the vital force exists. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and shelter.
Everyone can achieve lighting. This goal is hampered only by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the love path of the Mayan rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is founded in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in an omnicompresive love path.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (lighting energy) by using yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantra and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the focal point of Tibetan meditation. Through the portrayal of various deities, energy channels are cleaned up, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment develops.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to the collaboration between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the conflicts of system, procedural and cultural, caused the break-up between the two countries.
After two years since the end of the war, the allies of the time had become enemies; so began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years, and it would really be fought by mercenaries, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence had already been demolished; the only option was to beat in retreat and reorganize along the head of the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans were now obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the pact of non-Soviet-Polish aggression and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods through the oceans.
The task of the marines has always been to ensure that the country preserves its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the ability of the enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods through the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German military navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it had in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be raised by the cultures and tribes of ancient times in order to have freely available milk, wool, meat and skin.
The domestic goats were usually raised in herds left free to move on the hills or in other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (like shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of shepherdhood are still used today.
Already in the 16th century in England the cars were built.
Although they were simply formed from parallel wooden axles, the cars, when compared to the slightly more accidental roads of the period, allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossings were introduced relatively soon to keep track position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had on top of an iron bar.
It became a common practice, even if the iron caused greater wear of the wagons' wooden wheels.
Finally, the wooden wheels left the place to those in iron. In 1767 they made their appearance the first rails completely in iron.
The first means of transport that man has known were the legs. Human beings have started walking in an erect position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "the erect man").
His predecessor, the australopitico, did not usually walk straight.
Specialization signs for bipede hiking are present in the fossils of Australopiteco dating back to 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent future suffering we can begin to adopt more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can adhere to the environmental movement and also activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and turn it off.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind, while the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and extravagant life-style of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on 4 July, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and by the secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
The night was produced between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "The Dunlap manifests".
The document was read publicly for the first time on 8 July in the Independence Hall courtyard and the commission was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which made her read to her room troops in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 edges of Dunlap still known are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of the feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that combine them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay the eggs and walk on the two rear legs.
Finally, the manipulation of coded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all the computers currently used.
A binary number can only have one of the two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary or bit digits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning may be the presence in the home of a drug container or of an open chemical.
Check whether there are first aid instructions for that specific poison on the label.
The term acaro is formally used by entomologists for this insect group.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with the mics of beds, insects that have strongly adapted themselves to become man's parasites.
Both the killer cynics and the cimes of the beds are nidical, that is, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (SM) records some 400,000 known cases, placing first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a pathology that affects the central nervous system, of which the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve are part.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double compared to males.
A couple can decide that growing up a child is not in their own interest, or that of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their son.
In an adoption, natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But this is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible assumptions; also asking questions and making comments allows to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge were accepted, including psychology.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend in a decisive way on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even without external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, that is, viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophagus with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophagus protein with radioactive sulphur.
The mutations may have a number of different effects based on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and depending on whether the cells concerned belong to the germ line.
The mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause the death of cells or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism reminds people interested in the visit of natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wild fauna.
Examples of activities to be carried out on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and studying ecosystem information.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about the Orange of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country to go to work by car, crossing other people whose place of work is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic and even, all are somehow linked to a private car-based transport system, which at the same time support them.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced biosphere outside one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, most of which complain.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into ruins.
Why are transport systems attracting so many complaints, why are they thrown out every day? Are they engineers who design them that are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
The Traffic Flow (i.e. "traffic flow") is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to the other and the interactions they generate with the other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the conduct of drivers cannot be expected with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so in turn traffic flows tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented generally mathematically.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to lift the flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily to the enemies and to find food and compañeros more efficiently.
Most insects are favored by the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small amphracites to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones who are unable to fold the wings are the dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For someone he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), would move around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, why don't we have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest river on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some points reaches six miles.
The total 20% of the water that comes from the rivers of the planet in the oceans comes from Rio delle Amazzoni.
The main river Rio delle Amazzoni is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It overlooks the waters of thousands of smaller effluents.
They continued to build pyramids in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never overcome in terms of the grandeur and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were still enchanting by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at the time were much over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is made up of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and that with the least population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the daily language of use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything consists of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: land, water, air and fire.
These, in fact, are more like the four states of matter, i.e. solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, it also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metal. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys made up of minimal quantities of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so many trillions of them could get into the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil has therefore proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to an increasingly less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to get close to a temper.
We can only ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something new comes.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a core with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission pump.
In practice it is like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. So, further dividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break up in the presence of a low push or nothing.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km in the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be more on the next side because the crust is thinner. This has made it easier to lift the lava on the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people associate with and push them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the theories on the most widespread content are the Theory of the hierarchy of the needs of Maslow and the Theory to two factors of Herzberg.
In general, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to stay "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this kind finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, put into practice disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
In the extreme opposite, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels the need to change the entire operation of the team and do just that.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often leads to differences between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often have the contact point function for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than the members of the conventional teams, because meetings can take place according to the various time zones, which may not be included in local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is what sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the desire to address the long process leading to the construction of a learning organisation? A good reason for implementing the concepts of organisational learning can be innovation.
When you can use all available resources effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and engineering can emerge.
Consequently, the collaboration path within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order for an organization to define itself as innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the theory of continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological results have shown the physical existence of a theoretical approach to cognition investigation. The research area becomes more narrow and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain disease and behavior is the basis of scientific research.
It has long been known that some types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never previously observed.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite a strong scientific connotation, the IA represents a branch of the very important IT that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of the machines.
Research on IIA includes the production of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, vocals and facials.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is often used today in economic, medical, engineering and military, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
The tours represent a fundamental part of the course. Teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext for sharing experiences and travel reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students at the Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are stored online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. In fact, often their first experiences with blogs are distinguished by a grammatical and an uncarried spelling, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative opinions the author of the blog commits to improving writing.
The blogs also "strengthened students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to feed the public interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that is intended to encourage collaboration and develop the learning of students well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's suggestive and bilingual capital, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the past and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are more south and in the north you can admire the natural and uncontaminated beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The large areas in the north are sparsely populated, some of them are almost unsavory wild lakes.
If we compare the population, the result can be quite surprising: in the United States, the number of African-Americans is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent of its own.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxurious resorts, are mostly independent or associated with France.
In the land Arabs also took Islam, which took a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the road to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by Sahel, while to the south and to the west border with the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: it is recommended that everyone declare that they are married, regardless of the actual civil state.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one of the look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider to be a nuisance, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grasped by the arm, etc.
Be firm to refuse men, and do not be afraid of opposing them (cultural differences or less, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the X century BC; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenians.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name of White House, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather items, nangilla and so much chimper, but all this is reserved for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the volcano Nyiragongo destroyed Goma, burying much of the streets of the city, especially those of the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document well before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see African mountain gorillas.
You can use a wedding (taxi-motocycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short race.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctù" has ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the special of Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its more arabic touch than African, the city is distinctly different from the rest of the country.
The Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and flows east along the border with Mozambique, north bordering Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides support for a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As for all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are provided for the conservation and entry of the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the whole territory, represents for many tourists the main goal.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a sparking bar chart, even more evident because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon in front.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong has focused on the land well-furnished in the northern coast, densely populated.
This is the place that the British colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past of this land, this is a good point to start from.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastline of mangroves worldwide. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared World Heritage by UNESCO. The forest part included in the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps: in them there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the plain of the Gange.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is made up of marshy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wild fauna; in the area it is estimated the presence of 400 real tigers of Bengal and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-departmental bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those to the east and Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since bus services between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket with a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust Japanese small buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a broken bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, in Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guyana.
Its two tralices have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two wide lanes 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction ended in August 2011, but the opening to the traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when it is likely that Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in the present Eastern Paraguay. They were semi-omad hunters and they also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, living in hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of Indies", was born in the 16th century since the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
From the foundation of Asunción, which took place in 1537, Paraguay was able to maintain much of its identity and its native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in Las Cañitas polo fields, the most important tournament of the year is held.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and games even at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Argentina de Polo Association.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falklands sterling (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of British sterling (GBP).
The only bank of the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands. Stanley often can also be paid with US credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that peripheral islands do not accept credit cards, although British and U.S. currencies can be accepted. Check ahead with the owners to decide an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so you change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of Ecuador, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: rarely temperatures come below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature below the temperature indicated by the thermometer.
There are no "dry" and "pious" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of man, the fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
No matter how many docile they may seem: bisunti, alci, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they have not maintained an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population counts little less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was the sadly known naval stable of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 U.S. and German lives have been lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
Beaches overlooking the North Shore Pacific Ocean (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
It is mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
These are beaches suitable for families sometimes slightly crowded, surrounded by a wide selection of shops. You can take the bathroom safely.
The most popular local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You may have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could better face the journey.
The water of the local tap is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the coffee 'flat white' comes from a foreign idea. The espresso' is the black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral barrier and accidents for one of these causes on the coral barrier are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, stick to the directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and the estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period you can only occasionally find.
The sharks are present, but rarely attack the man. Most sharks fear him and tend to stay away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of river estuaries north of Rockhampton, not living actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveller has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he has reached his destination.
Travel agencies often conclude conventions with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campings, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast packages, airport transfers or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to provide you with additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted before the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
During some musical festivals, most participants decided to camp on site, considering this as a crucial element of experience.
To be close to the centre of the action you need to arrive early and get a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stage, there could be sections of the festival where the music will continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since the ice crossing causes quite annoying noises for those who are most exposed.
The cruises in St. Petersburg include the time to dedicate to the exploration of the city. Passengers of the cruises are granted the exemption from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase as much time as possible and money spent by their guests. Generally, there are no windows, no watches, and the exits can be difficult to find.
Usually they offer food, drinks and exclusive entertainment to keep the mood of the guests up and down.
In some places alcoholic drinks are offered by the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the ability of judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive to high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On iced and snowy carriages, friction is reduced and you cannot drive like when you are on the clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in very little time it can fall so many snows to keep you locked up.
Precipitation of snow, ice formation or condensation on the vehicle windows can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safari are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the holiday of many visitors.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips carried out by land, especially in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the cars, so a normal equipment is enough to get a good visual.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and therefore can be better observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "safari excursions", or "walking" safari) is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2012, and part of the events will take place in other places scattered to Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics took place in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the shipment was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary among themselves, however, most of the coronavirus cancellation policies, at the end of March 2020, do not reach until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most of the tickets for the events will be between 2,500 and 130,000, while the normal tickets will cost around 7,000.
Stretching wet clothes can facilitate drying. Many hotels offer iron and ironing board use, even if they are not available in the room.
If you don't have iron, or if you don't like to wear pressed socks, you can try with a hair dryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid restrictions or, in the worst case, burns.
There are several ways to sanitize water, and some of them are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is appropriate to evaluate the purchase of water packaged within sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers can come in contact with animal parasites that are not spread in their regions of origin.
The parasites may damage food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people with force are usually not qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between vegetation.
If you don't have the habit of driving on country streets, it is recommended to keep your eyes open, as they predominate steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves.
The speed limits exposed are significantly lower than those applied in previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict compliance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile phone service is much higher than that present in other sections of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria are quite tasty and varied, similar to those in neighbouring Austria more south.
Fruit cakes are a classic foreboding, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked sweets also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Most popular cakes are often accompanied by a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste little sweets but rich in taste can be guided by those who, according to the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
The curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry can present both "dry" and "humid", based on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan for curry in the regions of the hinterland, yogurt is normally used; in southern India and in some other coastal region of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional kitchens that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specifications, the term usually indicates the foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of simple preparation dishes; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Japanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The staffes are supports for the rider's feet and are hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present security problems for the possibility that the rider's feet will be blocked.
If a ghost is struck by a horse but has a foot trapped in the trunk, it could be dragged by the running horse. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that can be taken.
First of all, most horsemen wear riding boots equipped with heel and smooth and rather thin sole.
Afterwards some saddles, especially the English ones, have inserted safety bars, which make a leather cloth pull out of the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs are hanging.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Scalators of every part of the world continuously trace new paths on its walls, potentially infinite.
Sports on free descent snow, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very widespread and provide for snow climbing thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski booms" (the ski strips), which devote whole holiday periods to ski activity in a particular area.
The principle at the base of the ski is very ancient: the first rupest painting with the representation of humans that skan dates back to 5000 BC!
The alpine skiing as sport has its origins in at least the seventeenth century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-piste, mountaineering or hiking on skis.
It is connected, even if it usually does not include them, touring skiing or skiing, which are practiced on rocky soils and require much more rigid skis and shoes.
Think of the ski slope as a route similar to the hiking route.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances in some way more than those walking paths, but only very rarely will you reach the speed of the cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but formed by many independent countries. Normally, to travel across multiple countries it would have to ask for visas and pass through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area works rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to pass once again the passport controls.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus getting time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes a piece of antique. Some tax agencies consider such an object to be at least 100 years old.
The definition differs geographically from the age limit that may be lower, as in North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts could be defined as antique parts, although more recent than similar articles produced in series.
The breeding of reindeer is an important source of support for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade rests is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over the course of time, not all Sámi have been involved in breeding reindeer on a large scale; some lived in fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of Sámi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roman people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.

You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but remember that these opinions are targeted at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might encounter situations different from Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The views are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression with which any dangerous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social discomfort or loss of human lives is indicated.
In every part of the world, extreme weather conditions can occur, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, precipitation above norm and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to temporal, tornado, marine thrombs and cyclones.
Among the meteorological phenomena of high regional and seasonal intensity are the torments, the snow bubbles, the ice storms and the sand storms.
It is recommended that travellers inform themselves of adverse weather conditions that affect their area, as they may influence travel planning.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that is potentially a war zone must support vocational training.
Researching the Internet 'Corso sur los ambientes ostiles' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in a much more detailed way, usually using practical experience.
A course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on arms.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are distributed, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travelers who are planning a surgery to change sex abroad must make sure that they have valid documents for the return trip with them.
The intention of governments to issue passports without indications regarding sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and type is variable.
As variable is the availability of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Inspections to security controls have also become much more scrupulous in the post-September 11, 2001.
People transgender in the preoperative phase must not expect to pass the controls without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Risacca currents consist of the return stream of waves that break into the beach, often near a coral barrier or similar formations.
In view of the underwater topology, the return stream is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can be formed towards the open sea.
Most of the deaths survive because of fatigue in the attempt to swim countercurrent, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, coming back to swim won't be more difficult than normal.
Try to find an area where you are not likely to be trapped again, or assess whether to wait for relief, based on your skills and if you have been notified.
The shock to return manifests in a shorter time than the cultural shock (as we are a shorter "moon of honey"), it lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their country of origin.
Upon returning home after having lived abroad, you will be adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of the uses of your culture of origin.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely that you have met patients and understanding people, aware that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people didn’t imagine patience and awareness were necessary even for those who entered the country.
The show of the pyramid sounds and lights is the most interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the show begins, you will be able to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Usually you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinge becomes the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by several countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands there are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the boiler of a still active volcano filled with water from origin to a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region located south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the hills of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth mountains, a chain of 360 km cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Chain of the Sentinella, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massiccio, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cellular coverage, a satellite phone can be the only alternative.
A satellite phone does not usually constitute a substitute for the mobile phone, because to call you have to find yourself outdoors with the visual debris up to the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational boats, including those of sport, as well as missions that need data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about the connection to this service.
One of the most popular options among those who plan to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly common among neodyplomous people, since they can take a year before they start the university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year may indeed increase the chances of recovering higher education from returning to their country of origin.
The inclusion of these educational programmes usually requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of the thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
The boat is Finland's national past, where a boat is counted every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multiday stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two whole days, entering the ship at night to sleep.
A separate visa (from 2009 onwards) will not be required for the descent on the ground using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, moreover the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can scare people of all ages and of any condition, especially if they have never flew before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not like fear and personal aversions that many people manifest against other things.
For some people to understand how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or on the fact that they do not have control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies there were problems.
On some routes, air shipments would require days for discharge and customs.
The only way to get it to it faster would be to send it as luggage to stop. And it is here that you come into play, since the regulations of the airlines do not allow you to ship the luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to pay off a beautiful figure for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to be paid is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for travel to Business and up to eleven times the rate for those in first class!
In general, on flights from A to B it is not even worth searching for discounts on first-class seats or in business classes.
Air companies are well aware that there is a category of travellers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at destination, and consequently apply certain tariffs.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very widespread.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that in the past has been the theatre of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
Predominant religion in Moldova is that Christian-Orthodose.
Smirne is Turkey's third city by size, with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient city of Smirne develops on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active shopping centre.
Although in the city there is a more atmosphere similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, large streets, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are lined with the characteristic roofs of red tiles, the 18th century market and mosques and ancient churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views on the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the sacred church, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
In the north is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily reachable. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of famous Marian apparitions all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a common grave, and has an almost incalculable significance for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived these places, and many others who have seen their loved murders or made to work until death, whether Jewish or not.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid beating on the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid distorting these places by hugging the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; the Spanish is known almost by everyone.
However, most signals are written only in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used also for public transport and other services.
In underground, the ordinary ads are only in Catalan. Any interruptions of the unscheduled service are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-sufficient, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often only an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get well in Paris continues to be the best way to behave, interacting as a "very high" person (well educated).This will greatly facilitate your movements.
The harsh exterior appearance of the Parisians will fade quickly if you make the most of some good basic manners.
The Plitvice Lake National Park is rich in forests, mainly beech, fish and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and levels of different altitudes, there is a wide variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and cedar, next to several other most widespread animal species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most of the monasteries make available the stoles for the women who get ready, but if you already have one, especially if in vibrant colors, you will gain a smile from the monk or the sister at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants under their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after every user, so wearing these skirts you might not feel comfortable. For men, a unique size for everyone!
The main cuisine, such as that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.

All the nouns, in addition to the name "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "Lei", always start with the capital, even if they appear in the midst of a phrase.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This may also make reading easier, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a form that makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most of the words are spoken as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention are the c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the voice that follows.
Also make sure to pronounce in a different way "r" and "rr": expensive means benemato, while car means carriage.
The Persian has a relatively simple grammar and most of the regular times.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual can help you greatly with Persian grammar and in the understanding of phrases.
It is obvious that if you already know a Roman language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can reach the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore must not be studied separately.
Today, premodern observers are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden period did not represent a problem as it is today, they are usually placed in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in scattered areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept was originally from China, where the flowering of plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first celebrations for the flowering of the cherry trees were organized by the emperor for himself and for other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
The plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to even "only" a specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some plant specimens will cost you moving away from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy-to-turn city; you can buy virtually anything once you arrived.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the hot (always) and the strong sun (most rarely, when the sky is serene).
Some buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland water courses can be an excellent theme around which to organize a vacation.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can make a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can navigate the Erie Canal.

Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions linked to this celebration have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
A tradition is to spend the night of Easter staying awake in an open place to be able to admire the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations at the basis of this tradition, but it could well be a pre - Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the most traditional churches, a Easter evening vigil is celebrated, with the congregations that often start the ceremony at midnight to celebrate Christ’s resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands were swimming, flying or floating.
Because the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals could not face the journey. This led the giant turtle to become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to Galapagos.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains under the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to attend the boreal dawn, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are rarely populated, light pollution often does not represent a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners tend to be used to.
Office clothing is normally made up of jacket and tie or sizeur and is addressed to colleagues by name or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it is important for the group's commitment rather than commending individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the blessing of their superiors on every decision, and we expect them to follow the instructions without asking questions.
