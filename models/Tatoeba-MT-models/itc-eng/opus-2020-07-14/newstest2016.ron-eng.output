The UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the conflict that lasts almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again requested all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
On Wednesday, Ban stated at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries in the Council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the margins of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers “have made this situation unsolved.”
Ban asked the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 digits of polls showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But regardless of how some Republicans try to give Donald Trump to the top of the polls, it didn't work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads with a percentage of two figures and some voices begin to seriously wonder what this means for the numbering possibilities of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the nomination of Republicans.
Pundits showed that, at the same time in 2011, Rick Perry's advance took place in polls, but none of them won in any state in the race of nomination.
And the reasons why they would fight hard at the general elections are numerous.
But abroad groups such as Jeb Bush's Super CAP and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Here are some figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just something that goes by:
Figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six of the 10 Republicans have a favourable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for nomination.
In a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said that they would be "entuziasmati" or "thank you" if Trump would win the race for nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "surprising" if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say that it would be "intense" compared to 40% saying the same thing about Trump).
Closer to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they would be "unthankful" or "sorry" if Jeb Bush's favorite wins the race for nomination.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temper a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for the insults and his bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the poll conducted on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in the state of Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to the survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe that it does not have the personality to act efficiently and nearly six out of 10 independents say that its temperament does not have what to look for in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans get used to the idea.
When I take intellectuals' attitude, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, the question of who has the most chance to win the race for GOP nominations, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed from the end of July, when four out of the 10 were betting Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, the GOP voters have not read the future very well.
At the same time as the last election, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or retread to another candidate, Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while supporting Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted at the beginning of September of Monmouth University shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is located at a distance of 13 points by Carly Fiorina, at 14 points by Marco Rubio, at 15 points by Walker, at 19 points by Jeb Bush and finally at 33 points by Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who wins him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one-by-one confrontation.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new poll conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this direction and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% states that it leaves the door open to changing its option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently the Ben Carson neurosurgeon, but it's twice as likely as voters who say they've decided to vote with Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say I agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called the immigrants of Mexico "violators" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration was the main topic in the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bomb style will lead to a circle between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will harm the rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, six of the 10 republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as the problem of immigration remains in the light of the reflectors, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration against authorities reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican voters, largely because of their status as outsiders.
According to the poll conducted on Monday by ABC/Post, six of the 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone experienced in government.
People are also angry at the Washington authorities.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the provision of the Republics of Congres, 54% declaring themselves “unthankful” and 21% “nervous at the top”.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be examined closely by the media and Labour MPs.
During the weekly appearances, he asked for “less theatre and more facts”.
He also said that he could give up some of his participations and give up his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in leadership position, coming after he called it a "ghost cabinet" and after the speech he held on Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Party leader to remain silent in the address of the national anthem in a job held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted criticism from conservative parliamentarians and kept the first page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said that he “contained his silence in a respectful manner” and acknowledged“the heroism of British Air Forces in the Battle of England.”
But a member of the ghost cabinet of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, told for the two's Newsnight broadcast by BBC that he would be recommended to the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "no matter" of his faith that the monarchy should be abolished.
About twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing by differences of opinion related to the economy, defence and external, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, states that differences in policy are "comulated" in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr Corbyn regarding his position with regard to the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would eliminate the idea of restraint in its entirety.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "head" level from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Leader to face David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says that he has “outside sources” ideas for questions to address to Mr. Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentarian Islington North said that PMQs involves too high a level of confrontation and that it will refrain from reprisals and attacks, engaging in exchange to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn said Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take his place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the occasional word, saying that he approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this aspect.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs, but he admitted a few years later that he failed in his career.
From the first transmission in 1990, PMQs was considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, of the way it runs the Chamber of Deputies and of its position among parliamentary colleagues, although the critics said it became a cartoon and it needs a profound reform.
« Framework in Joburg»: Young homeless benefits from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and win their life.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage enlargement
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says that an increase in minimum wage in the UK could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of consumers."
However, that purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs in the company, he says.
Costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis should be praised and not criticized for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the fort created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior was more deserving of praise and not critical, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged in the light of the reflections by the scandalous effect that Kyrgios had on Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a quadrant game played soon afterward, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to break up Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios down, and I should have put this kid down."
Although he was last seen doing a dust rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry with Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was defended firmly by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where Sam Groth fights for the second place individually, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal Davis Cup against England.
“One thing I feel strong about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted to conflict a little bit,” Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused himself of cramping in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket of frustration against himself and I know Thanasi well enough that I know he wouldn't be proud of that.
But to be serious, it's been extremely good at pretty challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think it's worth a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and has integrated himself into the team, had no kind of conflict with the other players, is highly respected at dressing, is very hard, is in an excellent form, is a very balanced and mature young man and I think it deserves to be judged exclusively on the basis of his qualities and defects.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important game that begins on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the original player from Canberra in the long term on the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the game and not think about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he matures under the eyes of the public and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time when he is not at the center of attention to be able to reflect, good for both the team and him.
Elections 2016: The advantage of Hillary Clinton in front of Bernie Sanders has been halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins land.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down 58%), while Sanders is in second place, 27% (up compared to 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced that he will be a candidate for the presidency, is supported by 15% of democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it's too early to say that they've decided on the candidate they're going to support.
But Clinton's supporters are stronger in their choice than other candidates' supporters.
Faced with the poll made by the CBS news last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderators, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support for men has been considerably reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the best interests of senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was standing in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among the liberals, but Sanders now has an easy five-point advantage in this group.
About half of the democratic voters at the national level say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if she were chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters would be excited about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of democratic voters say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would want her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
In view of the Vice-President's consideration of a possible candidate for the presidency, 57% of the Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third of them think he should not run.
On the question of the second option for the party's representative, democratic voters call Biden the majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half said Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run the race in the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders grows, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn't run.
55% of the Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the greatest chance to win the general elections, but the figures fell from 78% as they were last month.
Biden is located at a distance in the second place, but the percentage according to which it is the most eligible has grown.
However, when asked what is most important to a chosen candidate, democratic voters prefer issues instead of eligibility.
As in last month, no democratic or possible candidate is considered by these electors to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in relation to some key features of their party’s primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be fully and reliable and having strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen in all three as regards integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is fully and reliable, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have a view of him in this regard.
Democrat voters generally consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
Regarding all these issues, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
How do the questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton while he was Secretary of State, most Democrats are pleased with his explanation of the subject and say that he did not affect their general view of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that this email-related controversy has not affected them in general about Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton to be an integral and reliable one, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at general level: only 32% considers it an integral and reliable one, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of the voters do not consider it to be integrated and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump whole and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank the first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integrity is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, but, as in Carson's case, many do not feel about it.
The error margin for the 351 sample of primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brotherhood charged for the murder of the student in the year 1 of the Baruch Faculty
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains, five people were charged with murder.
Members of Pi Delta Psi's College of Baruch in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, as reported by the police.
The official sources say that the victim was tied to the eye, put behind him a 14 kg bag full of sand and was repeatedly roughed while trying to get to a target on a frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused headaches after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi brotherhood did not call the emergency number after he passed out and claimed he would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police said.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the brotherhood at the national level, to ask for advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
“At this point, members began to hide their personal goods and put the good of the brotherhood before Michael Deng’s good,” Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head trauma, trunks and thighs.
"A lot of families have been devastated by fraternal rituals, but in 1970 at least one student lost his life every year because of the rituals," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Great Jury of Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with murder of grade three.
Another thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged for outrage and crime.
“We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved but, if there is an organization that authorized the brother, official or informal, we will also take her to responsibility,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch faculty prohibited the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its membership with the local representative.
Here's what happens when the Federal Reserve increases interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will suffer, the profitability of the bonds will increase and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history gives little clues to time-frameping..
After the first increase in interest rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determinant of how the economy and financial assets respond.
That is why U.S. central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on the moment when they begin to increase interest rates but on the trajectory of the time needed for standardisation.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in the game.
In the end, however, market players could see that all the agitation related to the increase in interest rate has been overstated.
"The first increase in interest rate decided by Fed after the global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some voices as a sign of the "cheap money" era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at the Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that all seem to be afraid of.
But it can't be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how a few sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation with which the market has been facing in recent months, anticipation of increasing interest rate can eventually evaluate things.
But at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which is reflected in the breakdown of monetary policy again," said analysts Deutsche Bank in a recent study on what will happen after Fed's growth.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has suddenly increased - by about 14 percent - to increase interest rate, quite invariable over the period of 250 days after (averagely 2.6%) after it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average recurrence in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the chief strategy of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said the impact on actions tends to become later pronounced in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits are beginning to decline.
The recession is a reality of economics but increasing interest rates often contributes to it.
In the present situation, Fed faces some conditions that have not existed before and which could accelerate a recession.
More precisely, the gross domestic product will be close to its historical minimum point for an increase in Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 increase in interest rate after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was lower than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question “if this time it’s different,” Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing for a Fed growth decision year-round, all eyes being watched for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economists believe that the WTO could approve an increase in interest rate on the occasion of this meeting, the term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study after 1950, all interest rate growth cycles to date have been in a super-increasing profit cycle, GDP eclipting peaks before the very fast recession after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the other hand, this was a strange recovery of slowness after the most serious recession of the period considered.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by Fed from the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of obligations, it appears that the benefits change the direction as soon as the first cycle growth/decrease occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the profitability of the bonds is falling immediately," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies believe that these interest rate increases will lead to the approximation of the profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, with the focus on the curve.
Highly cost-effective obligations are better done in such an environment, although “we are still cautious about forcing profitability,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes the markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"Aside from the strength of the dollar and the decrease in estimated inflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profitability curve is more straight, the spread of the average interest rate of credit has expanded and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when Fed narrows the policy.
In broad lines, companies that engage in majority activity in the US will have to gain from increasing interest rate and local products will become more attractive.
The large-debt multinationals will suffer because the rise in the dollar will lead to the price of their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that “quality” stocks tend to be more profitable within three months of an initial increase in interest rate,” analyst Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.
Strong-balance sheet firms exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital revenues as well as low volatility stocks have also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), and 3 (percentage points).
Duty will become an important problem.
Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also gain from the rise of the dollar.
Those who save may also have won, although experts do not agree on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for "protesting"
It says it's increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also looked at BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized Brits prizes
Comrade Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that neither this show is original
BBC Radio 3 is "transformed into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentman, putting pressure on the post to prove that he does something that commercial posts do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also informed the BBC chiefs that the public radio station "protests" and resembles the commercial opponent more and more.
"I feel that Radio 3 "protests" - although I don't like to use the word - but I think it's turning into Classic FM," he said.
It also caught the BBC Music Awards, released last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seems to be Brits under another name.
So, if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that only copy what already exists on the market," said Mr Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent with regard to live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anywhere about classical music that I know about Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new pieces," he said.
In the first part of this year, editor BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said he had to make more efforts to attract the audience to the previous period because the British had less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC label criticized during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would go to the tracks of its business rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by BBC from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and it is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be carried out "in a specific BBC manner."
He added that he wants that Corporation to “find the chicken with golden eggs in its own grade” next time launching a entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future taking of new seasons from The Voice or to spend money that goes to licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month has seen the slowest growth from 2000 to now.
The online sales took advantage of three years ago because of the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Specialists are of the opinion that the November Black Friday could determine reticence at expenses.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned British commercial streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total of the money spent in August showed the lowest growth from 2000 to now, with a growth of only 5% in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures showing a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we analyze the growth level of previous years and return to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalise over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, said Guardian.
He explained that online sales took advantage of three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's stagnant a little, you might notice a decrease (growing).
Black Friday, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for a decrease in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, the buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers got stuck in front of computers to put their hands on the offers, which led to the collapse of multiple retail sites.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when the buyers beat the chilippers, could determine the reluctance of the buyers.
A study published by British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 out of every £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently made via online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to call fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the sanction of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed after the macara collapse in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives have been riding on Muslim streets, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially blamed the giant in Saudi Binladin Group construction for the collapse.
Health Minister said that 394 people were injured after macara collapse
In the street walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a macara collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who complained of death joined on their way to express sympathy, until the first death came to the end of the final journey at the Al-Moassem cemetery.
The sad memory kept from the holy place, where only a few days ago a building macara collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the king of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the building group of the Bin Laden family for disaster, which was also fought by 394 wounded.
At the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a macara collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pilgrimage when he collapsed the macara.
Mr Akram was in the Mosque Sea with his parents before starting the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still reaching the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group shouldn't have left the crane's arm high when it wasn't working.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not present that detail, but said the company leaders received a ban on leaving the country.
Previously during this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macara collapse in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the macara and the Group representatives could not be contacted for the declarations.
The royal decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and did not coordinate its activity with the meteorological authorities.
Ten of the cranes surround the Mecca's Great Mosque, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has been closely associated with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is carrying out major construction projects.
The last leader Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegated" son of the family in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in conditions of strong wind and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of each fit-physical Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased victims would receive one million Saudi Rialis (174,000 pounds) and that the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will get half of this amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of the conversion of loans into Swiss francs
On the bank market, two loans have already appeared in Swiss francs, with the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come over a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting credits to Volksbank francs, and Bancpost has announced the offer of conversion for its customers.
According to data compiled by financial portal analysts FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest to lei, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the offer of conversion of Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of franc credit clients due to the second successive reductions: the balance with the value of risk commissions and customer-paid administration was reduced, and an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the lei balance.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the equivalent monthly rate in lei before conversion.
Thus, the Transylvania Bank reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the collection of credits in CHF is to eliminate the currency risk, the consumer being protected from future increases in francs, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which the pay is charged.
Another major advantage of both offers of conversion is that the reassessment of the property is not made, additional guarantees are no longer required and another proof of income.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and there will be no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a reduction in the monthly rate, as much as the customer's fee before conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is made up more of the interest, and the client repays very little of the main.
The very small interest bankpost offer in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
You don't know how this will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
One possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest is that the ROBOR index will grow significantly in the following years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR three months ago is 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to appear other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for the decision on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks at the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether or not to increase interest rates for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with 80 economists, a little over half that last week thought the decision would be taken, I believe now that the situation will be maintained for a while and interest rates will be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation in which a major central bank could drop the zero rate and initiate a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, bringing back trillion dollars in balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
See that they've lost their charm
The Actor (left), alongside his son Redmond (right), has been going through stressful situations in recent years.
He struggled with leukemia in 2001 and lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer in 2009.
It is also reported that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly has a cost.
The player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is on the bar for a few months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at the right foot in Manchester United's game in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following an unexpected intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20 years of age, broke the PSV defense.
He got medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his foot and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then he'll be operated in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, has difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something like this happens.
He's got his oxygen mask in the locker.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at the double break the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped from the red cardboard and the concession of a punishment strike.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say it's a fault and a red card.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: “Thank you all for messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, starting my way to recovery, I will come back stronger.”
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's accident in defeat of PSV
The foundation of the team of England has an added reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, coach PSV, said: "It's a very ugly accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never aim to crash an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg by playing for Mexico's national against Dutch nationals led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
“It’s very hard because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it’s a very serious accident, it’s not good,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I couldn't see but the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In the SBS6 statement, Moreno said: “I know how difficult it is to get through this.
I feel so bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission, but he's still holding fast.
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after I saw the selected team from England for the tournament, I did not consider a repetition of the 3-0 defeat in the test games.
I wouldn't remove any variant of a win on the move.
Maybe Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago, but it has good spin players in the batting line and collective morals is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a tender positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as spinner and Adil Rashid, even if unknown at test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left the England team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven games test against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no signs of questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - the players are their own selectors.
Some fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny was in his hands.
I hope if he does more runs for Yorkshire, he'll have some other opportunities.
The lead coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not as much as his ability and did not surprise me; first of all, he is a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question as long as a batsman is noted in the test games.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and on the way.
The only misunderstanding you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in maximum form - but that missed opportunity is the area of the past.
The team's coming Alex Hales, a batsman I'm very good at.
He's a cricket player who has "X factor" and I noticed earlier in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should at least be given the same opportunity as those before it, but this will certainly depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open up to the fight with Cook, which would lead extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a thrower couldn't hit there and this left-handed player already showed that it's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was no. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games test 38 as first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately deleted three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team on the back-up post spinner and, although I had limited contact with him, it hit me that he's a very impressive young man.
People could judge his age with an average of 31 at the beat and 35 at the ball, and they might think it's a point, but there's no bunch of spinners and the pickers chose for the youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has made some changes and to the coach team.
Mahela Jayawardene's name, batsman from Sri Lanka, depending on the consultant for the test matches could be a master's hit.
It's one of the best players and it's going to bring a lot of experience, as it's played in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both energy and unbeatable ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker, even if it sends messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes rests for one day's games, Root has been given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although not all of them agree, the trainers and the selectioners do not do the program.
And you have to retain, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never taken easily.
The Brexit Camp could have a cause if the economy remained in alamy until 2017
As David Cameron's renegotiated strategy to maintain the Great Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly in conflict, even without the choice of genius Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious critics to Europe on Tuesday.
The aliens also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last day that - plunged into crises similar to that of the EU - not all of which are internally provoked - some Member States are powered by the Great Britain's agenda of concessions and changes to treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they did not want this either if they would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor take part in bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capital, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who desires a Great Britain with an external perspective under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that more ministers and officials obtained from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but she has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation collapses, as happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, President François Hollande, France, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - something they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers could even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegotiation has been fixed" and "British Sea has not obtained any value from renegotiation".
The Europeans know on their skin how pickpockets can be Fleet Street and how skeptics are the barons of the oligarchic press that regard the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in report 2:1.
Perhaps I remember Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a co-correspondent in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of unpaid tax collectors, foreigners who cheat telephone and pseudo non-domes that hold most important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair sees them kind of the same, but he realizes that when you're locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a card issued.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me back on Monday at Westminster - I told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's boycotting strategy from an egg in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may last, but it must develop a coherent media cooperation strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at BBC left a vacancy on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call evolution with indulgence.
He says that he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservatives might agree with that.
This said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher struggled not to acknowledge that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as a shadow minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to fellow laborers, without going too far and without losing his job in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “in any situation” - Benn’s expression does not correspond to what McDonnell said or to what JC told colleagues and parliamentarians during a private meeting of Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey - you hold, sensitize me and I - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the turn of social networks, a focus of paranoia and treason.
It is right not to give Cameron a bill of favour in Europe, allowing him to take good support of the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbien's basic sophism of EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his NATO sophism - Tom Watson is insensitive to the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin be wasted political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to the Great Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the poor military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as reminded me of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists Criticise the Decision of the Department of Public Health in England on Electronic Cigarettes
According to researchers, the assertions of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of which have links in the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
However, a few researchers doubted the robustness of data and pointed their finger to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinary base of fragile” that he founded PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned the claims and substantiated them “on solid land or moving sand”.
Martin McKee, European Public Health Professor at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that it is expected that the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, about which executive director was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for conducting an independent study.
It also validated BAT's public health accreditation in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer but not the funding that there are reports that they would have received it from the tobacco and tobacco producer, Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on the basis of which the panel members were selected, but among them were a few known "faces" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the work of financing the industry.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
The head of the tobacco control section in the PHE also participated at the meeting.
The research carried out by the group “is convincingly biased” that they lack “solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have on the majority of the criteria,” said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "there is still no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, the director of the PHE Health Department, says that the BMJ claims have been answered in the past.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of two people who smoked all their lives lost their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health is less comparative, but we must continue to study long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that comes out and those that does not come out of evidence, given in particular the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related disease and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking up to £2 billion.
By clearly expressing the current evidence - that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not risk-free, they only present a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfill our national duty.

Complaints that shame Britain's arms trade
Follow the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Drone awful killers!
Fire to crush the ankles!
Pumps in Dispersion!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving traces!
The voice and animated images do not leave any doubt that this commercial for the world's largest arms fair is a heavy charade, made by Amnesty International to stress the desire of the British authorities to sell weapons to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and subways that need a second look.
“Important announcement, travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September,” says one of the announcements, using the London metro fonts and branding, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will be hit by DLR clients who are asked to contribute to the closure of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who have exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group named Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a pack of 6 pounds of Allen keys on which it says that "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet."
The London transport region is not amused by this vandalism as a steering wheel.
One of the parody announcements produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are heading for collaboration with protest activists, realizing that they must go into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets the shuttles traveling by metro.
The film produced by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP's creation director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the arms trading advertising -- with an empty space in the ExCel calendar -- and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the realization of a more realistic commercial, but “enriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more habitive.”
"They did a great job helping us to increase our interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment in the trade," said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and to ensure that torture equipment is not marketed illegally and delivered at the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms trade comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order received from the U.S. Army on “AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.”
It includes “a uniquely shaped outbreak that gives amazing effects behind the gun, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules to Live in Home
It's been 11 years since I moved to my home, while I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in beer and moral relativity, but I can barely remember the forced smiles of those who were upset - and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring varying states from falling nervously into the terror.
It is tempting to tell people where you live, if and where you spent a year of study break, how you feel about Corbyn, and why “you are honest, whatever Marmite you are because, really, you guys, it's nothing but Dr. HAHAHA's extract, you find me in my room.”
Breathe deep.
And help others breathe -- ask questions and show interest.
These souls talk and help you to differentiate the people you like from those you wouldn't talk to even if the tree would come and they would be the only ones that would have boats.
Don't choke people.
Bedrooms often abound with drinking parties, film series and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and try their underwear.

Introverties are part of special treatment at the university.
Your sleeper should be a refuge, but in many homes there is a dormitory culture built based on friendship, socialization and friends that last all their lives.
All of this can be terrible for someone who's trying to load his batteries.
Nothing in this culture lets you say, "I like you and I want you to stay friends, but I want you to leave to recover the energy I've consumed by interacting with you."
Try to sit down when a colleague is socialized - and try to send an SMS instead of knock at the door.
Speaking of knocking at the door: do it.
A guy who was sitting in the same house with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends cooking.
Since you start college in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock at someone's door to make acquaintance and take along and a black plate, it seems less strange, less general of the situation in the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've cooked you something, now smile and I ask personal questions."
Well-being prepared in the house is a great way to make you friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk and might end up associating your figure with a tasteful surprise.
Obviously, you must be a good chef.
Cakes of flour, sugar and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
The theft of food is a frequent crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you bury someone's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put it in tea is still stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve even if he's boiling on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you - try to address the problem more mature than my roommate, who has colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who have stolen.
He's in prison now.
Don't make noise that doesn't let others sleep or study.
That's not just because he's feeling good, but because you're going on your own.
A girl on the scene with me asked her neighbor to slow down the music because it was 3:00 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give music harder.
When they stopped music in the end, at 5:00 in the morning, the girl was kind and let her sleep two hours before she made the most of the music, locked the door and left for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/visitor wife would move on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you were to confuse a teammate with the future husband, couple you, split up, and you should meet every day and maybe even see him cover up all common friends?
Of course, you cannot oppose your heart - but if a sexy teammate is certainly not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
The minute you realize that someone has left their keys in the locked room, the line between pharynx and intimidation is thinner than it seems.
A successful psyche is fun, but it can denture in a few minutes.
You teach a funny and valuable lesson about safety hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't glue the goods to someone's ceiling more than twice.
Violin David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people working, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violin David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a solist but also as the initiator of a less common project, right "city", as he even says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who interpret a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it to be at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a representation, Sunday, in which solist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, when first the violinist Xavier Phillips was discovered, the works composed by Enescu being neglected.
Both performances, carried out on the scene of Athens, showed the public a different way to play classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at that time, the only classical musical ensemble where there was no director.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become monks, or to become an interpreter in an orchestra - I'm talking about instrumentalists, and not composers.
They're trained as "specialized workers".
They still feel like they need a director.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the fetishization of the music focuses on the conductor.
And so, business, the music industry, they do marketing.
So, we're not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have on one side skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but we have to look, what is stupid again," says David Grimal.
The rapist stories that this change in the way he does music came after his solist career's "musical disappointments".
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise throughout the world with different orchestras, to win a lot of money and to bring money and music industry.
After 10 years, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found creativity and human fraternity in this system.
So, we haven't found any sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did this without a director: "The world of music, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do I imagine you make marketing with a group of musicians where there's no ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", precising that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the overall existence, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a trap in the musical act: "In curious ways, the more complex we sing, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are forced to be present in the opera and not only in the role", adds Grimal, adding that to Sunday's show "I was 74 directors on the stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", just because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the largest orchestras in the world are present that sing and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you also invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist recognized as feeling the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so that he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but that's what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanesque music, "for there's also a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal seeks to change the way classical music education is done, considering that "the music industry, as it is organized today, has an ice of death" and as "the future of music represents the music itself."
We don't need to make the world tour five times a year if it's useless.
There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, they're all great, extraordinary, but as long as they're doing music.
If not, we're in a system in which creativity is suffering, it doesn't have freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and post accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had vegetables and good meat."
In order to enter the EU, we had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Product and agriculture come to the service of supermarkets as well as in France.
The same thing happens with music, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances may make reds not too beautiful, but when we cut them they are real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce his teaching into school, we reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we no longer need to sell music by-products," says Grimal.
Surely there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it has to be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's something else.
After your seeming, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist zambabind.
Grimal looks like, for artists, the reward of another kind of making music comes just from the passing of this status of "soldier", exceeding what "he thinks are their limits": "The musicians discovered at a certain time that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert came out scratchings."
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and his vision of music and of the artist at the "Ideal Festival", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
David Grimal's Profile
After following the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the direction of Regis Pasquier, during which he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the School of Science Policies in Paris before meeting with Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed his life course.

In addition to his solo artist career, David Grimal tended to explore and more personal projects.
The freedom he offered his collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe through adventure in repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
In addition to Les Dissonances, he set up "L'Autre Season", a series of concerts given to the benefit and with the people without shelter at the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.

Les Dissonances went up on stage on Monday, this time with the violinist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Small voices"
Cinema City launches the greatest challenge for children: the dubling of two characters from the super-production "Creation of 3D Snowflakes"
Do you have a super-talented, spontaneous child who likes the movies?
Give him the chance to get the star.
In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, they want to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Small Voices Mari", offering them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters in a famous animation film.
If in classical drawings the focus was placed on approaching the voice of the actor of the specific animated character, in the last period, to the creation of the story is taken into account and those who are about to interpret the voices, and they are usually well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that's why we're starting an unpublished campaign.
We want to find the right voice and get parents to join their children in our contest.
They'll have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the lines are funny.
"The boys will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania said.
In the first stage of competition, from September 11th to September 30th, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection that will be selected 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the smallvoicimari platform.cinema-city.ro, where to join the child to the contest and prepare it for voice proof.
Next, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is about to read and then the child will register by interpreting his own double version.
Four films about friendship, fairy-tale heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the test: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: Guardian of 3D Monday", "Blinky Bill: Koala the 3D Posnaş" and "Albinuta Maya 3D".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double one of the super-production "The Snow Queen - 3D Snow Cream", which will have the premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx winnings are mixed, tax forecasts for 2016 expire
FedEx said disappointing results for the last quarter, the delivery giant reducing profit estimates for the whole year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
Company shares dropped by approximately 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it is expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, with less than 20 cents, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts recommended $10.84, according to a survey carried out by FactSet.
The decrease is due to the increase in prices by 4.9% on average, with the entry into force on 4 January and the higher above-taxes for the land transport of large or high-weight packages, which will apply in November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase earnings compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
The President and Director General Fred Smith said that he "signifies himself to be faced with a considerably weaker economic situation than is expected, in particular with regard to global production and trade."
The employment plans during the holiday were announced one day after the UPS competitor said he intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of commitments he made last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the previous year.
The share gains were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
The profit has risen by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the survey conducted by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in international priority transport in recent years, leading to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has hopped the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the incomes of the Ground Division increased by 29%, but the operational incomes practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher basic rates, while revenues recorded by the freight division fell due to rising costs.
At the pre-market transaction, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares dropped by $3.85 or 2.5%, at $150.15.
On Tuesday, 11% fell to the year level and 17% to the maximum record recorded on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meetings in recent years, those responsible for the development of the Federal Reserve policies will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahon table to decide if the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank meeting room, a wall painting of the United States will be opened.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above everything.
The Central Bank has received a double burden from Congress: maximizing the employment rate in the US and maintaining price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a too difficult decision to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be rid of the unprecedented incentive offered by interest rate in the short term almost zero in force since the end of 2008.
Although most data indicate a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautiously about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only one quarter of the percentage point.
"Evidence, the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important aspects they will follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel & Co brokerage firm.
“But I believe that if they would look for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait longer,” he said.
There is no consensus as to the decision that Fed will take, it itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of Bloomberg's recent economists have anticipated an increase in interest rate this week.
But the financial markets expect Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the growth probability is only 30%.
This would indicate a decrease on the stock market if Fed increased interest rate, except where policy makers would reduce the strike by promising that it would spend a lot of time to the next growth.
Tuesday, industrial average Dow Jones climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16,599.85.
The sale was triggered by expectations that Fed's decision makers will maintain the rate of interest this week, John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group, said.
“It would be surprising that Fed would raise interest rates at this time,” Lonski said.
If Fed's decision makers would do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets."
Other experts said an increase in interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about the moment Fed was going to act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slowing down the monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that he expected an increase in interest rate this year despite high liberal objections such as the need for more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the growth in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by Fed as total employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of growth.
And while inflation continued not to reach the annual target of the central bank, Fed decision factors said that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices falling sharply.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to break into fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
Industrial media Dow Jones dropped by 16% below the peak record reached in May, as investors were afraid that slowing the Chinese economy will bring down global growth.
The market has somewhat recovered this month, the Dow index is now about 10% below the maximum of May.
For Fed decision factors, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the time of interest rate growth.
"Without what has happened on the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be stronger at the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was officially Fed.
Now, he expects that they will wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and that they have almost no data to be based on subsequent events in China," Oliner said.
The wellbeing of the global economy is not one of Fed's major interests, so it should not be taken into account in making decisions.
But actually, Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
The late president's hint, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that Fed could "strengthened" his monetary expansion triggered an earthquake on world markets.
In a world where markets and economies are more and more engaged, it is expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department of the Investnet welfare management firm Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has an over-sized reaction history to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic bases."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body, which supported the increase in interest rate, provided as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis affecting Asia caused Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the implications of limited identification for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to the respective falls.
Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the case of a major crisis, such as the 2008 earthquake on the market, Adam S. Posen, was a member of the Bank of England interest rate-setting committee.
The last tense period did not rise to that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to get to the situation of worrying about an increase in interest rate because the markets are upset," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this direction, I do not believe that it should take premature action.

There's also a car radius where you need to buy some engine oil.
The store is huge and it is necessary at least one hour to travel all the colors.
If you get hungry from so much you buy, eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The inside food radius of the store (good, affordable as price) is close to houses and offers more options of preparations that can be taken to the package.

Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few streets of Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own shared parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although there are chances that the store will be crowded, it usually doesn't find a lot of parking space.
Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite the attempts of the Nine channel to transmit to Today Show about the change of party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject the consequences of changes from the leadership of the Liberal Party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning display of the Nine channel transmitted from the capital after the defeat of Tony Abbott in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts conducted over a few weeks, including Dubai, New York, Cascada Niagara and Cancun.
This distance “crossage” did not seem to account too much for Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase compared to the hearings of Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were smaller than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference from Sunrise in the past few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, Parliament is not only affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main news was the amazing debut of the 800 Words series having played the role of the former star from Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, with the subject of a newly widowed father, who decides to move with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, had an impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show alone, without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's hearing results responded resoundingly "yes".
The X show Factor transmitted by Seven remained in position, with 1,136 million viewers, taking the face of The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven recorded ups and downs the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new moderate general culture show by Andrew O'Keefe had on average 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) rose to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia show had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge number of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The decline of the hearing recorded by Chase Australia on the second night will give silent confidence to the Nine that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at a Siberian airport.
Because he opened up President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after the police fired rubber bullets in protestors from Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the new proposed constitutions of the country on Wednesday, said an officer.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital of Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police used tear gas after they fired fires before resorting to rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The collision was the last one after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said that the new provinces established on the basis of the new constitution would distort their political influence.
Protests also existed in the west of Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in the violent strikes triggered on 10 August,
when four major political parties signed an agreement for the division of the country in the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial problem in Nepal, the country governed at central level for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new card could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues to exchange statements with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the meeting of the Government on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm position against the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated view.
Romania disagrees and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or gun cops.
"It's a shame for 21st-century Europe to apply 30th-year methods," said Victor Ponta
"The Prime Minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the Prime Minister concluded.

Another well-defined front of low pressure about half the distance between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles also has a 60% probability of formation of a tropical cyclone over the next two days, added the weather in Miami.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful for mild obesity diabetics
The benefits of weight reduction in patients with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say if mild-obsitis diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those who follow equifergic treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, called bariatric surgery, use different methods to lower the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a weight measurement unit relative to height, is considered normal within the range 18,5-24,9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used close data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - bypass gastric and gastrectomy in the mansoon - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes to people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in those who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received nephric treatment against diabetes remained at almost the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes cured completely at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured at only 1% and partially at only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of blood glucose over time.
Researchers wrote that the optimal level of haemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
Following surgery, the average haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
However, this improved glycaemic control - reflected by improved haemoglobin levels A1c - did not reduce mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the manson gastrectomy group, the bypass surgical intervention group lost more weight (18.7 than 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 than 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1%) than 2.1%) and presented a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% compared to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese individuals who underwent bariatric surgery had a probability of approximately 29% lower to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit to patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 procedural interests.
“This is the point where this work is critical because it says that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” she says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we wait too long until we urge people to take this aspect seriously,” she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that shorten their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent a call to put an end to violence in the refugee mother countries.
Dalai Lama talked about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that, in the present situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of each nation and even of every continent.
He also pointed out that, although admirable, the response of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It’s wonderful to look after a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, in Muslim countries,” he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US' violent response generated an uncontrolled chain of events.
After the events of September 11, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hands detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Wreath Centre, U.S. anti-Wreath Centres reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in terms of the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed hands with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Water Centre, cases of ingestion of the hand detergent in children under 12 years of age reported at the anti-Water Centres rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“The children have more access to these products and, unfortunately, one percent of them reach the emergency room,” Lopez said for CNN.
Lopez said some kids are intentionally drinking detergent and others are doing it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube you can watch movies showing teenagers how to drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that adolescents mixed the detergent with mouth water with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the detergent.
“A child doesn’t think he’s hurting them,” says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are perfumed.
Detergents of hands with strawberry flavor, grapes, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hands detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in small children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-toxicity center in Kansas University Hospital, for Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hands detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four hand detergent sprays with strawberry flavor, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was bluffing and couldn't go when he arrived at the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate baby hospital to identify the signs of brain damage, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, for CNN.
He could've been fatal.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free wet products or utensils and no longer let the hands detergent at the disposal of children.
In addition to poisoning with alcohol, some detergents were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hands that contained an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students from northern New York agreed to poison their "bad" teacher "putting antibacterial products in class" according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the hands detergent and banned him in his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "not meant" and raised the disciplinary issue of the school inspector.
Rumour Mill: There are no differences in Celtic
Griffiths exposes rumors about Celtic misconceptions, admitting that Hoops are not at the best moment but will come back.
Hearts facing SFA charges by Neilson and Warburton are cautious about the acquisitions in January that affected the team's unit
Dons increase the difference compared to Celtic at five points
The criminalisation of ADAM Rooney in the first round brought Aberdeen's men a narrow victory in front of Hamilton's in Pittodrie, Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths pops up rumors related to misunderstanding
There were rumors about misunderstanding in Celtic, demoted by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure as they prepare to face the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think players just wait.
Absence of Scots in the race for title bores Dutch - by Boer
Former middleman of Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters have lost interest in Celtic - because they don't fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, the current ambassador to the Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands he no longer transmits the summary of the Celtic matches; why?”
Because it's not the Rangers there.
Here, it's not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams and there's interest going.
The tension is high in the games in Old Firm and not just the Scots want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic was struggling from power, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now in the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Deila said: "Celtic has had periods before and will return."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
The same is true of us - but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtics as players become better.
It's extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton's judgment on transfers from January
Despite comments from just a few weeks ago that suggested that a few targets were identified for the January transfers, head of Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the unit of the Hebox team.
The former head of Brentford said: "The period of transfers in January is very different from the one in the summer."
In the case of players transferred summer, there is a period before the season when they can be integrated, which you could observe this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players who are not needed.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
The Swansea Striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw at the expiration of the agreement with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts facing SFA regarding Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Paterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red card of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: “I have not doubted integrity, I have not commented on performance.”
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken to account after he admitted that he played a song with offensive lyrics about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment," the striker said, adding, "I don't have to say that I don't go back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that those in the Dundee United still have confidence that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "the dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that Aberdeen's team has to cling desperately to Hamilton Accies to get the seventh successive victory in the league, which has brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the beating of punishment from the first shot executed by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: “There is no team to win anything, in the cup or the league, and not to win games like that.”
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain grows
THE RATE OF THE BOY in Scotland remains unchanged, with 164,000 in May, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom by total increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million at the same time.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that of the United Kingdom of 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the National Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over three months, the number of employees currently employed is 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% respectively - an average of 73.5 in the UK.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term government plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.
It's been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate of the labour force recording growth and the unemployment rate decrease.
Why am I witness to an execution in Oklahoma
During today's day, except for a late legal intervention, I'll look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a room for observers in the Oklahoma State Prisoner's execution room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, it terrifies my idea.
So, why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists can witness executions in America and, because usually requests exceed the number of places available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'd stay next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed my own connection with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story to the prisoner as he wants it, get access.
I cried at her.
He admitted that he “could have formulated better,” but he still feels that they are wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if I asked.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime.
However, they wish to have an international report on the subject.
He thinks that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the series of media files we made.
I'm not coming back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicating.
But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I certainly don't think there's been enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't pretend I'm totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to look at a man that I like dying useless.
Peter Moody claims that the Stewarts tried to spy on him and threatened to withdraw from the races
Peter Moody said the Stewarts Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the stars and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they carry out a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the removal of Lady Dadi from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result to Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about statements about spies and did not want to resemble “the fox that does not reach the grapes”.
"I wasn't going to say anything about that aspect and I've been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all gets over at once," Moody said.
It's known it's continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to endure the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want to be the owners I'm working with to see that I'm trying to give them everything that's best.
From the moment they start to believe that it doesn't happen that way, I have to give up my training job.
At that moment I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Previously, Moody threw the bomb in an interview for racing.com that said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
“After eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man whose name I will tell him if I’m asked - they offered to hire him to my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he thinks I'm a cheat.
If so, then you should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the time and I know and today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can it hold people outside the trains accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I need to take my license and step aside and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might lead them to think about this option.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on them and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
Frustration of the trainer increased with the long-term investigation of cobalt testing in which Lidari was involved and the removal led him to say that he could “put his license on the table”.
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of Black Caviar invincible champion, has labeled the treatment rule of the day of the race as "ridicial" after applying on the legs a cataplasm with nemol or clay, which violates the rules.
It's breaking the rules of the races.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put a handkerchief on his foot.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which has happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of the day of the race consisting of the application of the cataplasty, for which the Stewarts opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
“We all understand the need for rules, but it has gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by escape from the accident site.
The biker was transported with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being severely injured after being hit on Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley motorway.
Police representatives say the driver of the car didn't stop to help the wounded biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man handed himself over to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of running from the scene of the accident, of the denial of the first aid and other road offences.
The bicyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital, stable.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to the charges of wrestling.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms of the plating tactics used by his team as "destructed subjects" brought into discussion by the main two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the referees allowed Storm players to “take them off” the team in Storm’s nerve winning game in the final qualification played on Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Coach Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying game, played Saturday night, when he called that match a "demonstration" of rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland aren't very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in the defense of the plating tactics addressed by his team and said that the players simply focused on "contact" when they did.
Bellamy says she gained confidence after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us with score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything every year in our defensive systems or techniques, so that in the last six weeks we've really focused on contact in pleasure and so we've changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so it's probably not common to lose and was a shock to him.
It's funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "smoothing the football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett's won the 2010 championship by playing "plactious" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his game Saturday night with our Friday evening game and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he's not interested in anything black under his fingernail.
But now he has a team that can play what we consider to be palpitating football, especially due to the middle young rapists.
This kind of game you want to do it when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his game style - not any team has two middles like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like this.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think about us when they were thinking about the important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was a bolder competition compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good match, haven't I seen him yet, how far was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game were two more trials, which means exciting game?
Or does palpitating mean taking a break and not marching?
They're plans for me.
If I'm talking about us, it means at some point we could meet.
Storm has this weekend free because they have earned the right to play at home either with North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks, in the final of the Saturdays at AAMI Park, the tickets being put on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure the pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep and then authenticated to an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images having children as a subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
She looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages after which she immediately alerted her mother.
After the arrival, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at that address and found “worry” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with child subjects.
Hogg claimed to have done it to "draw the pedophiles" on the Internet before "he claimed he was a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee's court: “He said it’s an addiction - he’s dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he did his computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent his images and about the fact that he asked that person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to get it right.
He said he didn't think clearly when he drank and wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: “Then when the little girl found the messages on the phone, she shouted and shook and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23-year-old, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty of making or taking indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of parole on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March of the current year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the sexual offender register because it can be said that this offence “did not involve a significant sexual aspect”.
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was passed to the sex offender register before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, conveyed the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, the filming of the fall has not become viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by representatives of the opposition who claimed that they would have received anonymous threats of death, threatening them not to oppress Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they took him away during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Chief of Parliamentary Group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number, but it is entitled “death,” he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
It warns Members concerned that immunity only applies in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “concerned” with the threats posed to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availabilitys
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 availability as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year. HP will divide the stock exchange into two companies, separating the computer division and printers from operations with corporate hardware and services in the form of a booming growth.
The expected availability will cost approximately 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring to the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure with regard to costs," said Meg Whitman, president and HP Director General, who will lead the unit after the break.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently and will hold a broad business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of firms to the new business run style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate society, we are better placed than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a statement by the company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over $50 billion and will "focus on providing the integrated solutions without rivals" to the companies.
A company founded in 1930 by graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the purpose of producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called "Silicon Valley."
HP has passed through massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The HP measure, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest companies in technology in the US, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about men's friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the peak of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of deaths in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign against Unfortunate Life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship lies at the centre of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted by more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy condition”, his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces to half the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to have effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on the style and not on the substance, the immediate nature of the response has often priority before the contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even though in reality isolation is the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which also affect our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money does not even buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The mood of Joey's and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they look at football in the comfortable folleries and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that men can be associated with this situation, even though they often want to explore their feelings completely.
As a social worker explained to me: ..."My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who call us do not feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying to deal with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk about problems open.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The series highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective, external intervention, through the phone, people gathered in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you are participating at this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete editing of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and greet.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to put Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matudi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut match in the League of Champions and helped PSG get laid in front of the Swedish Malmo team.
We continue to present to you the game chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the game series in the League of Champions, with a quiet 2-0 win against Malmo in the game played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the League of Champions in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in the minute 61.
Reaching the A Group with Real Madrid and Shahtir Donetzk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the aim of the French team is not only the qualification in the best but also an improvement of the journey to the final quarters in each of the last three tournaments.
But even though they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity of scratch after being replaced by the team from his hometown and the club to which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or on the way to the Champions League, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference against the next class, even though there are still aspects that we need to perfect throughout the season," Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I'm sorry we couldn't get one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 shot at Bordeaux's house in the League 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took over the lights in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentinian middle offensive was called the man who will lead PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he slammed Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before he had an incredible whisper over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if anyone expected the PSG to win by punching their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to get to this stage and entered the field with nine holders on the national teams, with a defense of five men and two half-defensives, was a powerful opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making Nikola Djurdjic's whisper that passed from Kevin Trapp's post in minute 34.
Instead, PSG players slowed down the pace several times, giving several unnecessary and non-finishing interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed not less than five tests in the first recovery and was then replaced by Cavani right after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much more successful in supporting his colleagues, paying attention to him being the one Di Maria sent in a whisper of Wiland over the gate in minute 52.
The second goal was recorded in the final after an hour of the game, due to Cavani, the Uruguayan who wrote the sixth empty in the season after Ibrahimovic passed from the center of Maxwell.
This blank eliminated the Malmo's hope that they will rebalance the score and just a superb stop of Wiland from the distance to reject David Luiz maintained the final score before the new entrance of Ezequiel Lavezzi to cancel an extension goal.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that PSG was with a class over and that "The last game I played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I've only played in the league in Sweden, which doesn't rise to the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Down the hat for the PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, struck by a drop in stock prices on the stock exchange, raised $2.5 billion in the sale of shares as part of a large debt reduction plan.
Glencore Company, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said it sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off.
After having lost 57% of its market value this year, the company is getting caught up in price collapses on the stock exchange, because China's decline in economic activity influences demand and causes disaster in the market.
The preferential subscription right has increased the price of Glencore shares on London stock exchange in transactions on Wednesday morning.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion as part of larger plans to cover almost a third of its debt of $30 billion.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, with 2.4% less than the closing price of Tuesday.
He pulled out of the company 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the increase in the prolonged Chinese economy has led to substantial price increases in iron ore, about half, and coal, copper and other goods have decreased by 20 to 40%.
Xi calls for the wider expansion of the global economy
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reformed group that the economy needs to open up to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving opening policies," said Xi, in the 16th meeting of the Central Conduct Group for Continuing General Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting the openness and encouragement of reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and will take place economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of state enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through testing programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a business environment based on legislation and providing a wider opening up of the market.
The state authorities will also weaken checks on the powers delegated to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their business.
In accordance with the statement, China will also allow border regions to explore new patterns of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be opened to private investment.
“State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment companies and will provide them with better services,” the statement stated.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimising the requirements and smoothing the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
Li Keqiang and Li Yu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also participated at the meeting, in accordance with a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, unsatisfied by the Government's proposal to increase wages by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the unions in education have not achieved any results, the government proposing a 10% increase in wages, from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase in November, or a 20% increase in December.
The discussions took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
Today's government's proposal has not satisfied us, otherwise we would not have reached the stage of convening the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent that promised us today is less for us than what we expect.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have entered into in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
Ponta: In the future health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI, which will also be attended by the representatives of the Government to present to the representatives of the confederates of the country the proposal to increase wages, following that the unions decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister also told the unionists that the government was trying to send the Wage to Parliament as quickly as possible, so that it could enter into force on 1 December.
The legislative act provides for the increase of salaries in the education system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, the increase provided for in the document to be paid, over the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the unionists the full payment of the judges' rulings in 2016.
Immigrant crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned on Tuesday in Turkish territorial waters after the ship they were shipwrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, AFP reports, according to Yahoo News.

The state company announced that the decision was taken for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the measure is "ridicola" and "socante de sexista", says The Washington Post.
The delivery in the table is the most recent of a ten-year battle between the company and the more full stewardess.
Weight limit for these dates from the 1980s, when Air India began to use graphics with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the new Stewardese considered "extraordinary", which in fact "can have an effect on reflections and may prevent the necessary agility to carry out emergency measures".
The Stewardeses gave the company the trial, won and re-employed, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them weak have failed," explains a spokesman for the company.

The former selectioner testified that he did not understand FRF president Razvan Burleanu, after this took his place at Mircea Sandu, and thus took the decision to leave the country.
Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to raise his salary to stay, but he was refused.
I'm not sorry I left the national right now.
Then I felt sorry, leaving a job behind.
That's how I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selectioner, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions from the press about me.
He didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
I continued the work, everything went very well and probably changed it too.
But I wanted to go.
If he didn't want to stay, then I proposed to them an increase in contract.
We have about 400 and a few thousand euros a year, and we have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.

The government approved, on Wednesday, "National Immigration Strategy for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "a stage at which Romania goes in the efforts to modernize the immigration management process on the national territory", according to a press release.
The source mentioned shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect the policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the countries in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures were taken to manage the unitary and coherent situations resulting from the possible influx of illegal immigrants into the territory of Romania, generated by situations of a crisis of political, social, economic or military nature.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time they will give special attention to citizens from states with potential migrationist or that can affect national security," adds the remembered source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out a few general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, stricter controls of the legality of the headquarters of third-country nationals in the territory of Romania and the corresponding application of the removal and restrictive measures, the improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the implementation and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
Among these are: facilitating access to Romania's territory of third-party citizens who respond to the demands for the occupation of the labour force, promoting access of third-country nationals to Romanian higher educational institutions for areas and professions identified as deficits.
With reference to the Action Plan for 2015, the Government appreciates that it represents "a means of establishing concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system for halting the growing migration phenomenon".

Activity report of TVR, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risk removal
Parliament's Culture Committees rejected on Wednesday the work report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society in 2014.
In order to reject the report, 17 parliamentarians voted, one against rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the permanent bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary meeting will be debated.
"I believe that considering this situation will be done relatively quickly," said the president of the Senate Culture Commission, Georgica Severin.
He added that "good feeling" as the TVR's leadership was present at this meeting, on the condition that no representative of the TVR management was present at the Committees' meeting.
It was good to be present TVR because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members last night, with an approximate hour that we didn't know about the time, but today, after the Bureau meeting, personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I think that when you're called, you're a budget employee, paid by public taxes, and you're called to a meeting of the meetings even if you don't like living.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution in Parliament's sub-order," Severin said after the Committees' meeting in Parliament's culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed in the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees of Budgets.
The debts we also saw as they went on, came up with the idea that this year would be a day, but they didn't pay for the historical ones.
"I remind you that not because of my fault or any other of these commissions have lost that pleasure with banks and the fission, they are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary meeting there will be elections for a new Board of Directors, and he will choose the Director General of the Institute.
I don't know who's going to be proposed for this function.
Wonders won't be done.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man I'm lying to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand at the tail here and beat it.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote choose the people who will drive the TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have much correctness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what quality you need to have -- well, I feel in the attitude of the employees because it's a bunch of little guys coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
"When you get these 50s, 60s, 70s, something is rotten and we're talking about the financial situation that's a disaster," the president of the Senate Culture Commission concluded.
Although not presented to Parliament, the president-general director-general of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that Parliament have a number of measures which could lead to the saving and securing of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexing of TV charges.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexing of the TV tax, to amend and supplement HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public television service, for the purpose of updating the provisions on day-to-day technological change and for the regulation of the procedure on the control of TV tax and the finding of infringements and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision that provides for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv’s representatives for the collection of the TV fee, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission in cassars.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution to CNC from 15% to 3%, but also the modification of the Act 41/1994, in the sense of receiving budgetary/financial allocations for the acquisition of lincents for major cultural and sport events - the World Football Championship, Golden Cerbul, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will be unable to pay in the following months, given that the labour legislation obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not definitive, and wages rights are accorded priority to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenditure on staff and TV production.
"So travel and other cost-generating activities have been reduced, a number of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post has been closed", the letter of the president of the TVR.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by its own efforts.
"Without the support of the institutions of the state - Government, Parliament, Presidency - The Romanian Television will be, sooner or later, in the impossibility of completing its public mission", is mentioned in the letter.
The conduct of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.

The investigation found that, for the purpose of subtracting taxes and taxes from the state budget, the representatives of a company specialized in the provision of security services would have created an illegal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which the fictitious transactions would have been evident.
"In fact, in the company's accounts, the fictitious purchase of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget was thus damaged by about 600,000 euros," Roman Police explained in a press release.
The Seics have established Sanmartean's fate
The Al-Ittihad club's headquarters have established the middle fate of Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that the departure of Sanmartean by Ittihad is imminent, the entrepreneur of Coach Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will never happen again.
Boloni is very pleased by Sanmartean.
Lucian plays game headlines and does it well.
The sects also realized that he is the best and that he would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been the option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been more discussions, such as that with Mbark Boussufa, but nothing has been achieved," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice-President at the Court of Auditors
The plenary voted on Wednesday the appointment of Senator Ilie Sarbu, Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes "for" and 108 "impotrian" were recorded.
The vote was secret, with the ballots.
The representatives of the PNL were the only ones who voted against this proposal, briefing Digi24.
Furthermore, the Liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment in this capacity and announced that they would challenge her to the CCR, under the conditions in which he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign her from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow her to make any more policy.
The PSD will serve as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, which remains free after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was called non-constitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
How Bradley Cooper is going to play the role of a chef in the "Burnt" movie, the actor made a breakthrough that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up in the kitchen: "I've worked most of my life as a cook."
He devalued that he had worked in the kitchen for 15 years, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, because then, in college, he went on the same way.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the entire childhood cooked with Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the kind of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you laugh at if I tell you," he said, but he said that what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
Up to the age of 40, the actor admitted that he was seen in the near future directorship, taking on the model of Clint Eastwood, who took over the royalties all at this age.
Bridge, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational assertions
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto sentenced, on Wednesday morning, the claims of the Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to their political decisions in Hungary are "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, by his irrational assertions, disgraces the entire Hungarian minister," he sent the Hungarian Foreign Minister into a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: his total support for Romania's internal policy has been lost," added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that he wants to attract attention and punish the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a shame for the culture and values of the European Union".
I don't want to respond to the challenges that came from Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis," said Ponta on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that he is the host of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
The sarma, aggressive laws, imprisonments and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are policy makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - which we see in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!" the head of the Roman executive stressed.
Previously on Tuesday, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, described as "simple lies" the remarks of the Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management of the refugee crisis from Hungary, appreciating that these statements are inappropriate for a leader of the 21st century, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday as the "extreme and lying marks" of the Romanian Prime Minister on the domestic political crisis in Romania and stated that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing borders, like all those who are coming are terrorists, they're bullshit from the Middle Ages and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get it, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people like people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with bricks and insert.
"That's what I disagree with," said the head of the Roman executive at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest has decided to begin preparations on the ground for extending to the border with Romania of the fence that it builds at the border with Serbia, to face a possible change of the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to raise a border fence solves nothing of the issue of refugees and "hidden Hungary in Europe".
What's the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the macara from Mecca?
Saudi authorities announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible for the collapse of a macara, Friday, on the Mecca's Great Mosque, an accident following 107 people died.
According to an investigation committee, the company did not "respect the safety rules," reported the Saudi media agency (PA), reports BBC.
The company's directors received a ban on leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by the brother of the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years at the expansion of the Mosque Sea, to be able to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night, during a storm, when a macara, probably unbalanced by the strong wind gusts, collapsed on the eastern side of the covered of the Great Mosque of Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and almost 400 were injured.
How Did He Close Their Mouths · Global Voices
Considered by many of the world's greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after the withdrawal of activity, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform performance and in the new position.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Stara or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, after a year, the coach role of the Future Constanta, the team he owns.
After a fixed year after the team took over, the King demonstrated that he was able to transform a team that was struggling to rescue from retrograde into a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future registered, with Hagi Coach, 16 wins, 11 remixes and 11 infringers.
The balance sheet is one of a top team that fights at European Cups.
Things took a better and better tower for the Future this season, which team arrived in second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double than the Star.
On the other hand, even if he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start team came up names like Yanis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy made in the future a tracking team for foreign teams, so that Hagi sold this summer of 1.5 million euros - Yanis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
In addition to the Star, the Future is the only profit team in League 1, according to the data from the Trade Registry.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
Large countries come with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the governing college of the Roman Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe can't be turned into a fortress, and the very political means won't work in this crisis: "We may doubt the quality of the values these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality that we need to adapt to as well and adapt to them.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we are at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free circulation, but the rules in the Schengen area need to be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created at another time and that was not adapted for the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually hasn't solved anything?
Clearly, the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the board.
All the predictions said they had the necessary votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the unanimity principle and any state could block any decision in the JAI.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and internal affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, the rejection reaction even in Germany against the policy of opening Merkel and did not want it to appear in many countries as a reaction of the "EU sending us migrants to the head".
They have therefore, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably assist in major changes there during the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just left to get colder?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members on the Schengen external border to the responsibility of the Community agents.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Maybe he'll give up the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are responsible for the first-time state, because it's not sustainable.
If Greece is capitulate, you can't say infinity it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to resolve without a precise, perhaps mandatory, mechanism of imparting the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they get to them.
Because there's a problem: what are you doing with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think that the European States will be taking over migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It is likely that there will be single screening centres in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
They're working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience trying to integrate migrants, they are strong without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophob current.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% got away, winter is hard to get past the Mediterranean, but we expected next year to a wave can even get bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it so badly in the media.
You're talking hard with less or bigger experience.
Does there really seem to you that there is a place where there has really been the integration of large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at Maghrebs in France, in Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in the case of other migration waves, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't integrate at all.
There was an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But the police are not going to work.
To create the fortress of Europe is illusory.
The integration mechanisms in European societies need to be addressed.
Here were some mistakes.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, not to stay one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family, including by the brides of convenience.
But the imminent problem of these people's long-term problems must be separated from their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it doesn't mean we have to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of these people coming with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean it's going to make the country over the night and you can take them back.
Until the solutions appear, we see forces within Europe.
Boundaries are closed, walls are raised, checks are reintroduced to the border in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as it is not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and fixing the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where I put the foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean, we're just running around, but everyone's in trouble.
In front of such a wave, it can't be so, because some countries don't make a face.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run it doesn't change much.
After the French attacks, we don't have much more effective anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under the pressure of being virile.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people but also for goods.
This is the only European real market.
And I don't think the Europeans will abandon this principle of freedom of movement.
Like there's gonna be other rules, it's different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation right now.
How did Romania play so far in this crisis?
Like a little country, who thinks that if he pulls the sword on his eyes and hides his ears, the theme goes away.
In front of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be a part of the solution or say it's not your little country's problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Large countries come with solutions for the entire EU, good or bad, we are not talking about their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will decline greatly.
President Iohannis says it might be good that I haven't already come in.
So we move from the despair of entering to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter the Schengen area that migrants see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean it's a reason we're not in Schengen anymore, but we're more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed into the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, there will be unique rules for accepting migrants, unique rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia turned his attention to Syria in Ukraine no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, Russia's game?
Russia has frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means confusing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before the principal or opponent was the Islamic State.
About two years ago, there was a battle between Assad and the moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose, and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to kill.
Russia was able to complicate things, but it can't participate in the solution.
It creates a fire of instability and chaos that it can't shut down.
But you're powerful only if you have solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to buy time.
Maybe Putin's waiting to make bids, to press buttons to fix the situation.
The offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can solve things in one way or another created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are led by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will soon appear
Millions of Facebook users have become used to the "Like" button, and now representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike".
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will soon be available, informs New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg has specified that the "Dislike" button will show a nuance of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem as Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid the moments when someone posted on the account or an important event in life, and someone else would give "Dislike".
Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long called for the possibility of expressing their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable giving like that poster," Facebook representative pointed out.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not received well by everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and social networks," Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan commented on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article was posted with this subject.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, claimed there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at the eMarketer company, said it's hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports, the campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary within 24 hours
Hungary accepted on Tuesday only 70 migrants, a hand from thousands of people in mass at her southern border with Serbia, announced the government councillor Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to refugee flow, closing a main crossing point of the border and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The mass drew a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Minister Salb for Refugees, Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a record of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also registered in Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being recorded and try to get to the West, especially in Germany.
The new seat of the Council of Judges is set to fall.
Two manufacturers in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are now giving up because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The seat of the Judicial Council on the Vasile Alecsandri street will end up giving itself up.
A year and a half after the consolidation and reconstitution of the building had been completed, the work had not reached a half.
One last stage in the building’s epic was consumed last day, when the National Council for Conflict Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the firm that wanted to take over the technical project contract for the work to be carried out.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the manufacturer and the termination of the works, the negotiation procedures were initiated without the publication of an Impex Romcatel participation announcement, and the firm was to update the technical project and then hold a new bidding for the works.
"The negotiations were not concluded by a contract, but the CJ appreciated that the proposed form would be disadvantaged the institution," Răzvan Timofciuc concluded, representing public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to interrupt direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing court sent the complaint to CNSC, which rejected it as late as possible.
But this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision in the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of the Court may be taken into consideration finding another designer.
Thus, building building consolidation could be resumed as soon as possible next year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We're waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work to strengthen the former Police Chests office began in 2011.
A first contract of work was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei were carried out.
The tender was renewed, the contract being helped by Moldoconstrut SA.
However, the firm went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after it had paid 1.5 million lei.
The work has been done so far in proportion to approximately 50%.
Initial consolidation, reconstitution and softening of the building had been assessed at 7.7 million lei.
"That's it, I say everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former chief at Cadastru
One of the employees involved in the scandalous record at the Office of the Cadastru signed an agreement to recognise the facts, against imprisonment with delay.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the others accused, in front of the former boss, Narciza Nedelcu
A counsellor from the Office of Registers and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) was also charged with DNA in a corruption file and acknowledged his telefap.
The agreement on recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dălu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Court, establishing a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dăcălu was accused of false intellectuals in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in the chisos with postponement, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
As regards the facts charged to Dîtălu, the prosecutors indicated that he, as the counsellor of the Cadastrus Office, along with other colleagues, "made in fake cases of acceptance, sold the contracts of pre-keyed service loans by the O.C.P.I. and with the administrators of the SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Destrous Agency and Topography SRL and PFA Lipșa Stefan, which attested, in an unrealistic way, that the services contracted were fully realized, under conditions where they were not carried out and were not filed at O.C.P.I.I. Iaș".
Last days, the former chief of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current OCPI employees were brought to trial in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to the above-mentioned firms, although the works were not carried out.
The trial exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH president Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the female handball national for qualification at the Olympics costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, at a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the League of Champions.
As far as Romania's national female handball team is concerned, "the main objective is the qualification at Rio's Olympic Games, but for that it has to go from two stages of tailings, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We're really looking forward to qualifying for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight persons.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masons, gate coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualifications of some things, more exactly material for physical preparation, which we've never heard of.
That's all to get to the Olympics. And I'll do everything it takes to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot of money.
But this is the way to do performance.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age with the preparation.
"The teams we beat have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who said that he was trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The president of the FRH also referred to Romania's infrastructure and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don't have room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is embarrassing to be questioned by a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in other parts of the world Olympic paper was built entirely within a period of two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area in Barcelona was a dump of garbage, and now it has become a highlight of beauty.
The same was true in London, where the 2012 Olympics organization was a success and investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me, it's a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but it was very quick that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them we wanted, that we were able to organize, and they said they agreed and invited them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discussed concrete.
"So we have all the opening, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure," the FRH officer explained.
The former great handbalist has avoided evaluating the odds of women teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in prognosis, that if they fail to meet them back against them."
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbiists debut on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said, on Tuesday, at a press conference, that all members of Romania are prepared for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to get two wins: "We are ready".
Both my colleagues and I are with the engines at maximum tour.
We trained to give the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are hard and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But certainly, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participation in the World Cup, it's the encounter of so many years of work.
I wish I wouldn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, are proud of the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania's national team selectr Lynn Howells, who was first experienced as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It's a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it's very important that at every game I make the Romanians be proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Federation of Rugby, Haralambie Dumitras, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in rugby in recent years.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish sportsmen success and I believe we will be at the heart of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams at the age of 18-19, so there's cohesion, it's a bunch of friends who set themselves up to realize a dream," Dumitraș said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve in Group D, having scheduled the following matches: France, on 23 September in London; Ireland, on 27 September in London; Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at the Twickenham Stadium in London, with the match England - Fiji in group A.

14 million lei give to the "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital in Iași to the correction of the budget
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The "Sf. Spiridon" hospital received approximately 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health following budgetary correction.
The money that the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in work to modernize and fix clinics, but also in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds equipped with appropriate, ophthalmogenic microscope and other equipment necessary to perform the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the hospital's money will be directed to construction and setting up the "Marelu Ars".
From the money from the budget correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will receive the works from the gateway linking UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transport of the UPU sick in neighbouring clinics," the medical unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tataras, which will organize in the ambulance, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will function in the area where allergology, hematology and endocrinology are located in the ambulatory and will have about 30 beds.
Iaşul, laughed at by RATP controllers and a folder.
Country of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iași to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to tread again in your city.
Unwanted, they hit the misinformation from the folds, the failure of RAPT controllers and, bonus, a "so-called law" fine.
The wives arrived in Iasi a few days ago, they stayed in a hotel in the center and asked for tours.
They also got a fold in which the RATP routes were past.
"Armarmed" with these maps, the wives visited Iashul.
But two days ago, you were in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because she wasn't in tickets at the station near Copou Park, they were based on the information printed on the folding: that I can take the ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Folding trusts, they got on a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the folding.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said that there was no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
Where do I know what was written in the local press, I'm coming out one night before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, said they don't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is give us one fine instead of two (me and the wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day visiting the booth at the Jandarmerie and giving statements there!" told Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of the misinformation on the folder and the controls that "have applied the law to the blood".
It's not fair, and I have made a session at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not overstated, but the idea is that I felt wrong.
Conjecture for Vaslui rapists.
They had an accident and remained in pretrial arrest
The trial of the seven rapists at Vasu moved yesterday to the Iasi Court of Appeal.
The Greek magistrates judged the first term of trial in a non-public sitting in which the seven young accused that they had insulted an 18-year-old woman they asked to be released.
Before the actual start of the trial meeting, one of the foreign judges who had been assigned to the file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
By this summer, the Magistrate was active in the Vasului Court, where he was the president of Section Pe nale, who, on 9 April, admitted a challenge by four of the defendants, having their place in the house.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete of which the Mititelu and Geta Sandu are judges.
Previously, in the file he made a abstention and Judge Dan An Ton, because his daughter was in a cohabitation relationship with one of the rapist lawyers.
The two judges have decided that Vasul's rapists remain in pretrial detention.
Your blacks will remain incarcerated for at least 30 days, when the Jews will revive the possibility of their release.
The next term of judgment will be held at the Iași Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Iasi Court of Appeal, the van with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident caused in the Pacurari district, the car entering the Iasi on the belt.
Iveco's self-utility with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks wagen car that came out of the Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van is circulating from the end of Paccurari.
The car entered Iasi around here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi on the Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They cut the road a few miles away.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the prisoners called for another transport, to take over the detainees.
In a short time, a car was sent to the Iasi Maximum Security Prisoner, who took over the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
After the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the noodles, and the arrests came out in speed, two and two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the u.a. cars have understood themselves amiably about the damage to be paid," said Chief Medalin Tăranu Commissioner of the IPJ.
Large migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and intelligible: the 7000 refugees that they should and must naturalize Romania are, in themselves, a nonsignificant number, but huge compared to the Romanian state's ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of approximately 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinaryly small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasite of interlopi and paralysed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The need to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
Besides that, governments of any colour were unable to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent medical assistance, gather dirt from the streets, create honorable jobs or keep their own younger generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country they run from?
But what causes a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first struck by the belligerent offspring of the strong EU states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of the Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably afraid to steal someone's national being.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invokes the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, accept no other destination of exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can only be made to fade.
The causes must be eliminated, supported by some, and, by moving strictly on the book of political correction, ask for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country each year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed to us as an ankylosed, disassembled and overcomed construction.
I was complaining that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but that neither the EU has any future plan.
And improvisations and threats do not help at all.
Then what does the EU use, if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed - the right to freedom of movement - could be discussed because of the waves of refugees crossing borders as through cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the crisis of migrants, however.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.

EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years of age he received a bold gift: biological parents
Lost in ill-fated hospital, in the negura of the '90s, when she had only two months of life, little, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a family established in Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met again in Iaşi the other day with biological parents from a village of the county, after almost two decades when no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought of offering their beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iasi, to meet her necrolar past.
"Jași's day", which witnessed the search for the family of origin after a few extremely vague clues, was witness to these meetings that practically broke your heart.
The report of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are moving and overwhelming.
The story of the Cristine starts 20 years ago in the town of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the hospital, in the city.
At home there were disagreements between parents, and my mother had to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl, and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
"When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pashcani, and still the girl's father, Costica Balkan, went to work in Alexandria City, Teleorman County.
Their lives had to split up permanently.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After being admitted, Crina's father went to work in another town, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, never found her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She would have thought she was abandoned," told a family niece.
Because of financial problems, Grandma was unable to come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one has ever been interested in the child's fate at all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate for Social Assistance and Protection of the Iasi Child, who then gave it to care of the Prussian Placement Center.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were easier regulated than in Romania today.
At the Buccium Center was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted their baby but did not succeed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after some time it would have moved permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given her life," she tells us smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, while catching in his hand the girl's fiancee hand.
In the country, Christian parents, Alina and Costica, continued their search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but he received no answer where he might be his child.
The police then told him that he might be dead, but at Iasi parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the court that she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her have never been.
We prayed to God to be good.
I've been thinking about her in all those years that have gone by, but there's been no way we could walk, find her.
"It's hard," he tells us with tears in the eyes of Crine's biological mother.
But even though years have passed, the parents of Ruginosa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past was a tie of Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," Crina says.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Ichim, Director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Adviser, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, who explained to him Salvadore the desire to find the biological family of Crine.
And the search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started our first marches.
I just got a name, Balkan Costica, then the town, Ruginosa.
Soon we had an activity with the city hall there, and I could ask if there is a local name.
Then they gave me a few clues, just that the person you found wasn't the one you were looking for.
"It's been about a month before we find the girl's biological father," Commissioner Ichim explained to us.
In total, more than three months have taken the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that everyone has a home in another town.
We started moving somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed identifying biological parents and discussions.
"Then we established that a first meeting would take place in September," added Romique Ichim.
On the past weekend, Alina and Costica first saw their lost girl in the hospital halls in Iasi 20 years ago.
The father, moved with emotion, could barely control his tears, and his hands were still shaking.
He's barely changing a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was still nervous, trembling.
"To see your baby after all these years, it's something," a niece tells us, came in with Costica from Ruginosa.
Meeting With Mother and Biological Brother
In the discussions with his girl, who is to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Costica Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wants to return to him in the village, he can come quietly: he can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and to hook up a house.
Mom's also excited, she's crying, and she hardly thinks that such a thing could happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think this could happen.
I've seen such cases on television, I've been thinking about these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," she tells us with great tears on Alina's cheeks, crina's mother, while she keeps a napkin in her hand.
In him he hides his tears, of happiness, because soon he will see her face after such bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will accomplish in just a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm down as an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she's drawn a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to get his thoughts together, because he's got a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are eventually the ones who raised me.
It'll be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family reunion in Iași
In the Union Market, under the early autumn sky, the family of Ruginosa rejoined their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, she ends her high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
No longer split borders or countries, but only a barrier: language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian owner of the place in the center of Iaș, have passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that, in the future, if there is a chance, they will do it again.
It's the first event of this kind organized, such an emotional load, and I'm glad to be a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that only deals with consumers, drug-dependent people.
But we're trying to get companies back to something good.
"If I'm still being asked for such an event, I'll do it with great pleasure," says Romanian director Ichim, Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Iași Anti-Drug Adviser.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, is breaking up telling.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with guns on your foot yesterday at PSD.
Everybody pulls their soul
The stables in the PSD's out-of-office closed an armistice with a leg gun.
After successive rounds of discussions, carried from Friday to Sunday, first and most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostility.
Pressed by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the social-democracy Jesuits will send him an entire list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
As far as he's done, the party's internal war seems to have just taken a break to allow fighters to shoot their soul.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3rd we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing certain has been established.
In the October elections, a strong competition is expected for the Chair of the PSD’s Judiciary Branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main function of the party's outgoing subsidiary is Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, Judge Counsellor Vasile Quanta and Acting President of the Judicial Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could also be added to the mayor of Schitut Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of the PSD’s councillors Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer be running, sources from the party saying that it is not interested in function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last few days is that of the former leader of the subsidiary, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day candidates can be tabled, and no one would wonder if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will also remain after October 3rd, when we have a new Executive Board, a new Permanent Judicial Office and all the new leadership structures," said Quanta.
Until the organization of the internal elections, the leadership of the PSD’s county branch will be assured by Victorel Lupu, a close to Nikita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until September 29th, preparing the elections to be practically assured by the executive secretary of the branch, counsellor Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with camp Nikita.
Contacted telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in the last few days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached, in order to support a uniting team to deal with the county.
"On the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions of candidacy at the Iasi PSD presidency, the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
An outgoing judge refused Vasul's rapist file on grounds of cohabitation
The seven young men of Vasul's county convicted of rape arrive today at the Iasi Court of Appeal.
Vasluians sentenced to punishment between five years and eight months and eight months and four months will present their arguments on their release today, after the Court of First Instance, Vaslui, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence is pronounced.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making a withdrawal request, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked that one of the lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concobin, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest penalty in this file.
How the Judges Motivated the Judgment
At the end of last week, the magistrate at Vaslui's Judiciary, who sentenced the seven young men, motivated the sentence.
On the basis of the judge, he talks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public opinion.
"The body finds that after the time of the pre-emptive placement of judicial control, restrictive measure of freedom but not deprived of liberty, under the impact of the accused, of their families and their local supporters, a strong sense of indignation was felt at the level of the local and national community regarding the fact that persons accused of serious crimes are judged to be under a less restrictive measure", says Vasului Judgement.
The magistrates also demonstrated the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be "the church door".
"The body stresses that the moral quality of the injured person is of no relevance, which the defendants have wanted to highlight by the defenses they have formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext", it further states on the ground.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
Because of economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years cannot continue the same in the years to come.
Until Saturday probably a few people knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many wonder how much it can affect our choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing leader of post-war laborers.
Marxist declared, anti-monarhist (he at one time asked Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), an anti-American ferocious and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to renounce nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
After the model of all the populace demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what he said and promised Tsipras and Tsipras in Greece until he breasted with the real world and economic legacies.
The economic programme of the new Labour Leader provides, inter alia, massive renationalizations and the printing of money as a solution to the financing of development projects and the covering of very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the money-printing solution is not unanimously adopted on a global scale, we would then have global prosperity!, but who else prevents such details.
Of course, we can charge the bankers with blood, become some kind of left-hand service enemies, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by the generous, uncovered promises made by the demagogues of the peoples.
As Margaret Thatcher's attention was well drawn to, "the problem of socialism is that at some point the money of others is finished."
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme as the party's fresh leader, failed lamentably in the elections.
And then there is still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce as a whole, and extensive automation has led to the massive need for highly skilled labour in the industry, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from opposition, he can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its latest financial Times number, Corbyn's choice is believed to increase Brexit chances and the exit of Great Britain from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a strong opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left-wing Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the crisis of refugees in the EU's foundations, you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for the Great Britain.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which was to take place until 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep failures created within its Euro crisis and now that of the refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
The more for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the French-German axis (in which however Berlin becomes increasingly the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers of remaining the country in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer the one in the past.
There's a lot of resentment that's growing in intensity right now.
The problem is that Brussels, even recently, has shown it in Jean Clude Junker's speech, is increasingly trying to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States, consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And that happens under the conditions that electoral support for anti- anti-immigration formations, which are at the same time and Euroceptics, grows spectacular throughout the continent.
In other words, the negative-loading emotional climate has reached higher rates than ever before.
From where and the conclusion of the Financial Times when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today's politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we are going to see a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest and the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds their populist rhetoric of the frustrations accumulated in western societies.
Because of economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigrant zone, both of which have been caused by hasty decisions that have not taken into account only integratiistic political ambitions, and not the ability and availability of Europe's peoples and governments to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal pressures of the EU will increase in intensity and may affect Romania's greatest situation.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncus, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Breathers: "Take the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
But behind his name is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "rot."
What do you write about Constantin Brâncus?
What else is there to say, actually?
Figured he showed up on the notes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising clip.
Brâncuși produces and delivers money at almost 60 years since it is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards bearing his name.
On the other hand, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with odrasla, he hears the following instructions: "Let's go to the park, to Brâncus".
The country is haunted by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to the world, from children to the elderly.
Brâncuși's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Neither did the communists manage to remove it from Romanian memory and culture.
His cities are spreading the internet today, getting hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would it be to say, to write about this man?
From the pile of books and articles trying to reconstitute his destiny, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you didn't have the chance to be born in any big city and in a family as long as it is, your chances of success in life are almost null.
Brâncuși's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe the following text should start here.
With a sentence, as hateful as they are.
Look at the silly success stories that are delivered to you every day in newspapers and on television.
Look closely at the figure of this man.
You want to know how to make it alive, how, today, did he hear a whole mapmond?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the municipality of Peșşani, Gorj County, at the foot of Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Marie and Radu Nicolae Brâncus.
Although he came from a family of rich peasants, Brâncuși has a modest life, but one of which has to pick up his sights that will guide his artistic vision to be late.
Remembering his childhood and the places he grew up in, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Peter Túțea, from Paris, from 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people led, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything was going quiet from one ants to another.
And you know why things changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
Brâncuși's childhood was, however, far from an idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuși was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when "the casino", following those who dislike the liquid to see if the process takes place properly, Brâncus captures a moment of general non-attendance.
He fills his way through his palms and drinks on the breathless.
He falls into sleep almost instantly.
The first people only notice after a few minutes.
My mother panics, then in hysteria, believing his son died.
By evening, when the father, Radu, returns from life accompanied by praise, he sees from far away the desperate signs of those who await him with their souls in their mouths.
The party is immediately turned into cages.
The father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brandșa, dophtoire and serve the Brâncuşi.
The chin checks the child's breath, then puts it under the whale's nose, gathered around.
The baby's sneezing strong.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further, of joy, the party with lauters continues with more force.
The next day, the father and the son meet by livada.
Radu Brâncuși makes Constantin collect the nuts and bring them to him.
The father lays his child down and, with the knots brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while you feel the dizzy of the blows, little Brâncus has the revelation that the world can be looked at from another perspective and that things around you can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit to old age, if somehow not the star itself participates in his disorder.
Was the sun as troubled as his father as what had happened to him?.
At the present time, the city does not work
A parliamentarian calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
The independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop internal struggles and reorient their agenda to the electorate.
What we now see on our political scene is a great disbination and so on.
I haven't seen any of the USL projects in 2012 that go on.
Nor highway, nor Regional Emergency Hospital, see just how politicians disagree with possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let's just leave the politics a little bit, get together and talk.
At the present time, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blăjuț said.
He appreciated that the current political class disenfranchised the outgoing electorate, the consequence being to be a very small presence at future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The MP also believes that voters will always turn to traditional parties, expressing their reservations to new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break from the right-wing electorate, not from the PSD.
Such games are based on civic active people, who are usually on the right.
"It also claims more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said Blăjuț.
He indicated that he is not interested in a candidacy at future local elections, discontinuing the rumors about his intention to enroll in the race for the Prime Minister.
I also said I don't want to run any local functions.
I'm still thinking about continuing as a deputy in the future term.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iasi and in the discussions on the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make a picture of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," Blăjuț said, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A colleague from the Tataras said he didn't get his money and he had to go on the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up the cash from the cash register.
At the end of my term of office I will report on everything we have spent, outside the salaries of employees at the office and its maintenance.
It happened to rise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and the other.
"Tell a parliamentman that he doesn't get his money is pure hypocrisy," Blăjuț concluded.
