The populist right triangle in Austria, together make up 29 %
The elections ahead of the Austrian parliament have resulted in the first approximate results, a considerable weakening of both parties in the current great coalition and a significant strengthening of the party of the populist right.
Strong and special losses have suffered from the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the current President's position, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously blocked.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carintia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent votes, thus losing 5.5 per cent in comparison to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still has finished the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the postwar and especially for the people who convened these early elections.
Still early in July, when the PVO left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in terms of preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party's president and, to date, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this Monday could be achieved at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
Such developments would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of the electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties on the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same year 1999 should be repeated when the populars negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 BZO dismembered) for a coalition government that had generated a sanction on the part of the European Union.
For this evolution I clearly waged Haider who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he has already taken his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and has descended from the third to the fifth position among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illegally picking up beetles, it could become a chill in Czech-Indian relations, according to the Foreign Minister, Karel Schwarzenberg.
The minister in New York expressed this way after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this were not solved then yes, then it would certainly come to this cooling," he noted after the meeting that was organized on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get in.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempt from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local Darjiling government in whose jurisdiction the matter rests.
"Your problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest authorities.
Then you can request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises appeal to the High Court and then it would be possible to pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter the matter is to get the convicted a "legally competent support," said the Indian minister.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already achieved by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize him," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, his colleague stressed that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a terrible mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he had received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I have received a lot of promises," he only found.
An arbitrate Czech fight in the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, it represents Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and also to it the seabed surrounding it.
The region is at the same time as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and Sea Affairs.
His boss, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this scale and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides to this day a world little known, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms so far bear the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the land firm
Coastal countries have started to fight vehemently under the sea the new territories.
According to the UN Treaty, these benefit from the rights agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is primarily about the so-called Continental Edge, which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental border.
"Simplely, by Continental Edge, it means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the limit of the sea coast, and often, to the border of the two hundred sea miles, i.e., pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continent border should be delivered with scientific documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a number of years of job preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal assistance commission.
The commission has so far processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward," says Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide impact since it was the first that essentially expanded its marine domain.
However, New Zealand also achieved it - the seabed area it was awarded last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pain in their studies.
The profit that will be released from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their applications.
They can do so until 10 years from the time they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Where the continental border ends begins the region of the ocean fund declared by the Treaty as "common inheritance of humanity".
From here on, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not any gold mine," says director Mikulka with emphasis adding "that their separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and their regime defined by contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is divided with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to exploit in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The background there is accidental, it's something like a sea replica of the Tatra.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometers may be exploded.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a little potato or some fantasy, the Shem, who according to legend revived the Golem.
During the liberation of hostages the command of German special forces was at the scene of action
To resolve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not performed.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in Salvation, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, at the liberation site were the German army specialists as well as GSG 9 officers, the federal police aircraft squad, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As the ministry spokespersons reported on Monday night, the German forces did not need because kidnappers, given a violent release, let their prisoners go and escape.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany's help to use it as a support in the place.
"Unfortunately he did not arrive at that moment," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the attackers had kidnapped a group of travelers made up of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers became unknown until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible rescue payments.
Meanwhile, safe and healthy people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the custody of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the salvation package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress lets little fail a large saving package of $700 billion for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected the government package for financial salvation by 227 votes against 206.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, he did not reach a majority for the programme with which disorder should be limited in the financial markets.
With dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked Members to vote, although the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened at all," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause was the concerns of the investors that the state rescue package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary to leave the programme in force.
Organizers record an increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the next few months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation, the desire to travel by Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more in comparison to the same period last year.
According to the investigation by the GfK Market Research Institute, reserves for the fall months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The results base are GfK figures that are the information analyzed about bookings in 1200 travel and computed agencies approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar above all travel to the United States is of great demand, the DVR reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased almost one third.
The German preferred destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the German regions.
Above all organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DVR.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculators for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with advance booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well reserved, so that the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, comparing last year, went down.
My first Octoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Balneario, the beer in jars of one liter and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A debut at a tent.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional tailor-made Bavarian costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already used.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're barely in the tent, the photographers have already rushed toward us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very clever about everything because I'm the first time in Octoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to fulfill its function.
In fact as a tourist in the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not so long.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seems to be taking a chance or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my frontal receives rare glances next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A muniquesa draws my attention to my apron that had dressed in the wrong way: "the left is single, the half is the virgin, on the right is compromised, behind is widowed."
Oh, God, now I'm slamming behind the left.
"Okay," he says laughing.
The others don't worry about many subtle methods to flirt and wear hats where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time in Octoberfest.
He looks like "gorgeous," which says with a very long "or".
I told him after he put his glass of a glass of beer that had just been drinking.
He put it right next to the burning mouth, most of them think that's a garbage cube.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who can drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock at night, the health groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear in groups every time - suddenly they are always four people who bring the covered streets from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: Come sober, return drunks.
You don't see who's suffering from alcohol and he's on the floor.
"They are the ones who "can't anymore," gave me the answer to a health care answering my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Accident victim identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in Brentwood City, was involved in the accident that happened on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then he has been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey was determined to be a member of the European Union, the European powers helped the desire to penetrate this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renacentist style.
At least this is what the guides say.
The building is set to time the end of the platforms and is in front of two towers, one for each corner, all of which looks like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once you've passed the box at the vault, there's no doubt what the company's greatness was that this was the most western door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition of mastering the Middle East through this railway that was healed up to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
the British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station has fallen and stood out of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the Eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new partnership policy.
The Turkish Government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to a letter and went to Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kinikioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shaking, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmatic change in Turkish consensus
that has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and "power cartels" where middle-class managers in business costume - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a central-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Dress, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," she tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
It's not one case if it's not for one or the other.
He has to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask you, "Could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he answered, "does not want to face that choice."
He then points out a point that almost everyone I've spoken to so far had recited almost of memory: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to the East of Asia and the Middle East.
Again at the Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they be to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, largely in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man in Europe."
So there is not much doubt in which the continent must claim this fascinating country.
Lifes to remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (September 11th) was responsible for Guildford's Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent choir of young people, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for children under 21, but at the time the Proteus sang its end in 1979, several of us were ending at the age of 20 - we only refused to give up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changer of forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether Madrid or Messiaen, regardless of whether they were accompanied or with a complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and to the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in the music.
That's the only way to sing!"
His blouse was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imposing, not too flowering.
Anyone was the musical scarf, always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a knight, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of your concerts and can honestly say that I have never, for none, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sell one or two well-known war horses all over the world."
We're gonna miss you a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) he states that "in 1946 economic history studies were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree, a degree degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not totally correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship of Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and life" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew attention to me because of their simplicity and the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda Supersales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If your predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new monovolum has an even wider interior space.
All of this includes refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolum are numerous.
Among others, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics can be noted.
However, before analyzing the new model, we must comment that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation is introduced on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a phenomenon of sales.
This is the case of Japan, where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Precisely in Japan, about a million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Honda, however, wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean 17% growth in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 jazz units since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish branch is expected to sell 2,000 units of Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly palliate the decline of sales in Spain.
In fact, the trade mark officials expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which means 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16 per cent drop.
Despite this increase in Honda sales it has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% of last year.
Also, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For markets and estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in society in the month of January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length rises to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axles up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, interior housing also grows.
This profit is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are the version with engine 1.4, as the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic crystal - is an improvement in access to the rear squares.
And the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two gasoline propellers of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2 liter mechanic gets a power from 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm to 4,900 laps.
This propulsor - which before Jazz reached 78 horses - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
With regard to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation had 83 horses, now becomes 100.
This 100-horse Jazz 1.4 achieves combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The bee shell that prevents collisions
To advance in the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in particular, on bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the Safety Shield in four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of brand vehicles.
During your flight, each bee creates its own personal space with oval shape that looks very similar to the Nissan Safety Shield.
But most important are the composite eyes of the bee, able to see with an angle of over 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately translates into the collision prevention.
"At the moment you detect an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at the right angle or higher to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require keeping information or intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory gigs, not even megas."
This is the first step in developing new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan vaticin will introduce into the serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
Thimble before mortgaging
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid for injections, is not lacking in engineering.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on garbage mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a gentle and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the Hotel of the Bad Credits... or the Loss.
The tertical aspect of this accommodation and especially of your receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
True, you have useful, but not detailed information.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for all the public.
What if the game is completed?
Because there's a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because we buy a better house and we don't even talk...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disbursed $9 billion to acquire 21% of his capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in his stock exchange quote.
A week after an interim agreement was discovered, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 % of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at the price per unit of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion extra dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a yield of 10 per cent and a conversion price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of a price per unit of measure of 29 dollars, or 28 % above its current change.
Morgan Stanley's action lost at least 6.79% to 23.07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
" This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the banking holding status," explained Juan Mack, the director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he goes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought the participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wished to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley titles by 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20 % of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert within one year half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capitals provided by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance sheet and increase your liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group, however, refused to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have relieved his balance sheet much since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its stock exchange contribution down to half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on their debt took off.
This cost fell back last Monday but remained at a high level, about 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of Wall Street's large investment banks after the bankruptcys of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that they had raised $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
To refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example, his colleagues and friends, was the third to vote on a project for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64 per cent of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results referring to 80 per cent of the elections.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28 %, the 7% of the suffrages were null votes and the 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the more one suffrage.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling centres and a count from a non-governmental organization had announced a comprehensive victory to the "yes", estimated from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night on Monday.
The " Constitution triumphed in a crushing manner " , he had assured Ecuadorians who headed the Guayaquil government, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points consolidating the " new socialism " defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the power of the State over the economy, with reference to the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign companies and to foreign currency sending their emigrants.
With the exception of Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of State, which may perform up to two consecutive mandates of four years each and will be able to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 per cent of the population lives under the poverty line.
It foresees the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 people kidnapped have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been liberated by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good at their arrival at 3:30 p.m. on board a special plane at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They find themselves healthy" and "no rescue was paid" to the kidnappers, the Egyptian tourism minister, Zoheir Garana, declared at the airport.
On 19 September these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in allerrenos in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and from then on moved from one zulu to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Egyptus, in charge of the organisation of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of shots took place, and they killed half the kidnappers, the others fled," said this manager who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "relappago" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces in Belgrade.
"It must be recognized that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the Sudanese army he claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrestrial on board which the kidnappers, of whom he killed six, among them the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unit Liberation Movement (SLA-U), an assertion immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the miserable sums that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or to national historical sites that die of hunger?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and his heritage buildings?
Why do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros just to restore the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of the Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 benevolous persons regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy worry about searching history, preserving small amounts of private files and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and leaders throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation to the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is in trouble due to the impact of the mortgage crisis in the US market: the three countries will support a total of EUR 11.2 billion to this financial and insurance institution which also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Head of Economic Competition.
Fortis Bank was the first to suffer from the crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves more than a year ago, so the decisions taken with regard to the Bank can in some ways be regarded as precedents.
According to the decision taken in the early morning of Sunday, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will safely sell a part of its business, including all the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year of the Dutch ABN Amró.
The actions of the Fortis began a strong decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with their 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break down.
The company's actions only on Friday decreased by 12 percent, the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares decreased by more than two-thirds.
Noting the current prices of the shares, the total value of the group's capital on the market is about EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's leadership imposed the sudden fall of the actions of Fortis to the insecurity of the US market in relation to the approval of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, the actions showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new director general of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors had nothing to worry about, they are not going to lose their money.
Among the Bank's customers so far, no panic occurred, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased lease companies.
Fox in the hen
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when they see the data on the purchase of medicine, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which can be used for the use of recipe data in all cases in conjunction with the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the fox chicken" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, the designer of the medical prescription follow-up program.
Insurance companies are dependent on the insurance price and the amount of compensation for the health status of the client and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They first sent the customer to medical control and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the check.
Dick ten years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: with the customer identification number, he easily gets the list of medicines purchased in the last year and mid-year, and the program itself draws the conclusion on the client's disease and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is virtually incurably high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
They circulate numerous versions of the program, some even set a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has just something to do, although there are small difficulties in this.
Among the disadvantages of the program is that some medications are multi-use, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches as well as for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, require the approval of the patient.
The authorities already oblige them to do so, although they have not received fines for the neglect of so far.
Some companies have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them with drug consumption data to obtain more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and it is increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill giving the right to the control authority of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he has therefore developed his programme, which will require the specific approval of the person for the supply of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because if the insurance companies do not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, however, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union duplicates its trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocally trading partners, this subject in addition to the other global problems dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will be held today to focus on cooperation in nuclear energy.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, Senior Foreign Policy Representative, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase to more than one hundred billion euros, their trade exchange.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessively ambitious objective.
Thus, they legally harmonized the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation conventions existing with India, so that air transport can also fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both parties condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and hastened the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also adjourned, although both parties have great responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will adhere to its energy and climate programme, that is to say, by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, as should the next year's climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases decreased to 2050 with 50 per cent.
They also wished to impede the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - it will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that French companies will receive charges of EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian editors

A meeting with the print at Room Struktur in Buchmesse Hall 5.0 will be held: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and outlook on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors progressively decreases over the total of Italian production, in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire disappeared a year ago
the remains of Steve Fossett's plane have been found, the millionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on an altitude of 3000 metres, in the area of the Nevada mountain range of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has cleared up the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it is the very thing about which Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance" said at a printed conference.
The commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found on the plane or around.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Security Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a team of investigators has been sent that has identified the device: it is Bellanca 8kcab's own, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash money and a sweatshop.
Fossett’s search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of beginnings.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, it had become the first Man to complete the world's turn into an aerostatic balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later, he had turned the world around on a plane and had no ladders.
Among his records, that was also because he flew at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A suv out of the schemas with an original design and well established with defined lines and determined angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the last born among the "compact" land trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Owned by the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompanied the launch of the Glk suv, available in the exhibition rooms Mercedes-Benz since the next 17th of October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a automotive brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different stages, which dominated the central street of the shopping Milanese, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the stereoscopic car and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the images will make the impression that the car goes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to recompose into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this publicity is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is being played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Others Italy" group that has been following for years the Italian National and that so far, to tell the truth, has never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fanatics either.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Trivenet.
De Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These in Sofia have been added a small group (times units, in fact) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three color flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night have been removed so that they are not identified.
The English fanatics are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of the Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the party: all already with the names, so easily controlled.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: between what they had gone out to Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have rejected the ticket and also the trip.
The interior ministry now expects to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fanatics who have been arrested or to whom it has been identified in the disorder.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents not only the Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't set foot in a stadium.
Luckily!
But now is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others be added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way," said the Ministry of the Interior.
Therefore, "well-open eyes" especially in view of the party of the National of Wednesday in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
The Observatory is held tomorrow, on Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (information and external security agency, that is, the secret service, which takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm raised during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...."
This is Domenico Mazizzelli's (unhappyly expressed) thought, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the position he was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazizzli had been head of Trieste public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazizzelli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been shameful.
"I don't do sociologist – add n.1 of the Observatory – the crimes are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
So far this group has acted well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let us also speak of the silences to the hymn of Mameli: these too are not a crime, but if they allow neither are of education...".
