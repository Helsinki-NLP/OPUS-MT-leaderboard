UKIPs who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use special arguments, then you discredit them with a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to tail behind intolerant chronic hypochondria who think everything is due them.
I think you're the one who's using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing fences, does not exist virtually.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A citation drawn from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
Mail didn't write the report, he just made it comment.
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should be shot for propagating such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
Neither do you know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence has a lot of surprise, but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to make it happen.
I'm not of course where you want to come from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rarely said because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of god and not a reflection of their own inability to understand that the complexity of mankind is something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes the period of austerity, nothing will have been fixed.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's ''EUROPEAN TIGRE'' was proud of us a few years ago.
We've seen the suite!
This starts reading the article again.
We try to make Ireland believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ''New Economic MIRACLE'' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, imposed on the lowest companies in Europe, a three-fold labour market, an ongoing emigration.
With these ingredients you don't know what '' paving'' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the 20th century, Illance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with the Portuguese In considering a constant perimetre, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development was not a long calm river, it's about recent events.
The lowest rate of taxes in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the real taxes paid by multinationals.
If a report is believed to be released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full cash.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, and the recovery is evident in the daily caps since the return.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments are about to go on fire.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hanging on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some bags and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said I fly with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two once it's afloat.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair have a passenger supplement paid for the additional fear that we were willing to provide?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man
I've never taken Ryanair and the last three times I've taken the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can be happy about it.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic tariff have only to take to themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what will be the delays and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was a mistake of the airport air controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally grunts of the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of the restaurants (mostly), or for the Salon de la revue at the White-Manteaux Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, bourade de monde with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is clouded by the fact that they buy in retail.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons .
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, lowers prices.
Sunday rest is a right for employees, with the exception of workers.
That is why it is laid down and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister responsible for the economy, nor, on the other hand, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
As long as they do.
What's the use of the law?
Satisfying part of the population and businesses who wish to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday afternoon I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if the succession of her daughter was, against her will, to use to pay the succession costs?
There are paintings.
Some of them are good, others are terrible.
Surely his succession would like his part of the cake, if you would pass the expression to me.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He stood up to the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis and he won very cleverly.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and his energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had for these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That its descendants sell the paintings on the free market to raise the money for succession fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the moment of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with low-renewable infrastructure sites.
As to the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the true French bad: they lack confidence in dialogue
Return to the main values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either we come to his aid, or he has DROIT in exchange for the services he renders or made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the dancer who lives in the income of his property.
There is a need to differentiate the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives on his pensions.
A property to rent or two for a couple on top, it's vice
The little genius of Finance is particularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortage in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are overcrowded.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decay emerges in response to a recession that is only a savage decrement so brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less difficult, then the need for investments is alarming: isolation, renewal of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
Taxation that promotes high incomes and incomes.
Who's in charge?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallop.
Samsung's profits are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors from the same range
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all those phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's sake.
I believe that it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft set up this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms to boost competition and development.
In addition, we have all different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them options, functionality and price prize.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform."
Is there a "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing portable industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and needs to be encouraged.
That's what we're all interested in.
I'm glad you found out exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our friends on the sidelines who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men ( on the contrary, well on Parisian bobos) could tell us which author they are fighting the ideas about the genre and tell us the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're someone who's smart and cultivates.
I said this about Judith in the vineyard of Furusato referring to Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I don't have her vitality).
Otherwise, in the "fund", since you send it back, this subject doesn't interest me, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I was hoping you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow, but I understand...
@ Jean: recognize that, culturally, to send Judith to Holopherne, it does.
Who's afraid to ask the world?
But what are we afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us answers.
The first by invoking Judith from the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic cutter of throat.
You can see how much these studies affect the most intimate of them.
Of course, we are no longer in the debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read,Jean,that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it would be appropriate to go to sources.
To fight ideas from the sole exposure of their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic cutter of throat, I was content with the "Second Sex" (it was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and made some disappointment to have sometimes the sight blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, the cloud of last night would really close the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey making Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will make it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover the whole week of Perséid meteor rain and for almost all of the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think that there's a bad genius whose sole aim is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
WHO watches this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it ends (perhaps) by disappearing?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Beautiful picture of the moon over the Harbour Bridge of Sydney.
Looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing on inequality between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Further liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The detail and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext link to the original documents so that there can be an opinion.
Go to see today on Tuesday 15 October the results of the miraculous revenues: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece the stock market collapses.
However, this seems to be the examples to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a demand for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Department of Economics tells us that these claims for compensation are not based.
What if the Ministry of Economics has made a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have gathered the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The suite in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
@lol No the State is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget because the temporal horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is depleted by the life of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered to be unproductive, they contribute to the financing of material and immaterial investments in future growth and therefore future revenue.
Some elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrat: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth does not correspond to your ghost.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands related to the law as written by the politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, secure shoot rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
In fact, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't earn money with drugs Vu that the Liberals want our health system to look like the one in the United States, you should learn how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the tubibians, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of businesses and to "research".
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the world prices of drugs everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is on sale free or only on prescription.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that curb them and the expensive permits required.
Although manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy to use alternatives such as marijuana, those that can produce good quality products at known doses will benefit widely.
Sorry to tell you madame but you're wrong, there's a lot going on in the backseats for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a hospital manager.
We can't have patents on grass...
If social science researchers did research instead of politics and networking, they could use their "work".
One investigator, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
Compare it's not looking.
Comparing is doing no research pedagogy.
You can't say "search is successful you have to apply it" and then in the same jet "you have to experiment with everything."
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why do you ask that we apply it?
Can you explain to me how a "searcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn when they learn how to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they did not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the use of building an indicator that informs you of what's going on, self-promotion, deception?
A single way to train teachers: to move away from training sophists and ideologies and that practitioners teach practitioners.
manufacture link the paragraph on internships (which is not highly argued) and you will see that your conclusion drives us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads primarily to the reproduction of existing practices, and that does not allow us to advance the system ".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it is not desirable that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have all their place in modern teacher training
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to the theorists of education would ultimately destroy it.
Your analogy is totally fierce: if I don't want to be operated by a practitioner who only has a theoretical training, I would still rather have a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the task.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in charge of combating copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thank you Mr MDR.
If one day I start feeling guilty of violating copyright, I'll just read an article like this one.
In an information economy, copyright violation = theft.
It is the same because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license doesn't cost anything.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without proper license, you deprive the artists of their winning bread.
You can always argue about sloppy assumptions - but it's stealing.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become true.
It is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start feeling guilty of violating copyright
It's obviously not bothering you to deprive the artists of their incomes.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictional income.
Lesson No. 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have passed by one click.
Perhaps if they share their mp3 walkers with a boyfriend in the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export this resource that we're proud of, the raster who says it's all wrong....
If it is a PS Member who affirms it, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they're old to choose, I'd advise them to leave France if nothing had changed from here.
France pulls people down and helps them continuously.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down, these are the speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business ever since.
I had the CHANCE working in companies led by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm employed because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the null bosses I often encounter.
At ease in my basketballs I fully share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, when compared with German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises and small ones - What do French employers expect to do to do so ??
Let the state hold their hands?
This state that they accuse of imperialism?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-company couplet on your side!
Remember, you created yourself as a job, as a value added, to be as severe as that?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who are bouncing and mining while awaiting the permanent attendance of the state!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removing the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare demand the reduction of wages or their elimination!
I look forward to seeing all "negative" comments on this subject.
What is ironic is seen in the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves floating rather than transforming themselves.
It doesn't mean that Scottish railways have not improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do so, hello.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't.
But, well, the Labour is going to get us bored, isn't it...
She's an international subsidiary.
They are already operating trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral enterprise and taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all of this to finally cancel the decision.
And there was better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well Labour, as they repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and believes that workers all have to go beyond the borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision;)
This may be because Dutch management is on good tracks when British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not simply a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, the concern of intelligence, the listening, for example, the fact of being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beaters", who are no less dead, I know of palanques.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, we're gonna start over, too.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you that this is AIDE.
Nothing to do with anything worth...!
When in the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'm starting again.
Insinuating, it would be only for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves, everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
Desired to think otherwise, if having a strong morale will likely allow us to accept and prepare for heavy treatment more easily, try experimental treatments as this woman did, and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who's fighting medicine is primarily someone who trusts medicine..
But if we'd rather hand it over to the "lord" it's something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get rid of yourself to become just a zombie.
Personally I've caught two of them, dirty, big ones, and if I got "cut" as those psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of nailing your teeth, suffering from hell and beating your teeth.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "fast" and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
Did the communist become a nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans over the past decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please question what you have voluntarily left behind: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MAIN Rule of International Law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians, and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he were to defend him, he would be humiliated by the West Compressor Roller.
The West have used a smokescreen to detach a part of a sovereign State that has unilaterally proclaimed its independence and has been virtually recognized by the Western States who then lied ultimately to the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, which is mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office to have failed to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic of Tyran (even if we do not love him).
To my knowledge there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece, measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
This kind of study is definitely useful and thanks for having us share the results.
A hope therefore but caution is to put This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from the Earth in the Constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules," according to a study conducted by Drake Deming's team and Jonathan Fraine from the University of Maryland.
This is a method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat.
Thank you, Passeur de scientifiques, to reward us, often, with these experimental prowess that are being accomplished in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably because of the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of earthquake.
Like radone, for example.
A dry a priori gas for man but may be detectable by animals.
All of these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments available to him.
But we don't have reliable results on these tracks...
It has often been observed (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on art telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to earth's magnetic fields, and in particular to their modification before a earthquake.
So of course I'm not scientific, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we speak of the "signs" given by the animals, we encounter in the same manner: everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I don't understand you thinking Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as a mayor in London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and always tries to have fun with a joke.
He never answers directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to get elected as mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just highlights how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a piece of shit, isn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because it's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it is a celebrity and people have been taught the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him, and the same will be for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the Tories' popularity rating will crack the ceiling I'm sure of.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people love jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one
That's exactly what Londoners were saying.
He should have brought with him his friend the blinking, smarter than he
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French have really and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the trouble of reading a few books (there are some of them, including a French and excellent of B.
Millot), the "Solomons" and the "threat of iron" speak, unfortunately, as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be in the background since the Battle of Savo) did not want to return there.
We actually went to the island of Savo in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even though the mission has its end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecological side is a total smoke.
Calculate kerozene consumes to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept..
Just go through the list of sponsors only philanthropy.
An operation of how much more is not done or done.
The cow, it gives too much desire!!!
I'm looking forward to the webserie!
Your account gives me a review, identifying me a little in the passage (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn au Moulin Blanc en rade de Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep reversing us, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Bonsoir I think the red hat that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region of Brittany and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies should not spend a sum of our taxes on financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as those!
Are there players in the current Serbian training that is of kosovare origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once in Juventus and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
He's Bisevac, the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder or earlier in the 1970s and 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as an attacker in the great Velez team, who, under the guardianship of the legendary Suleman Rebac, ended twice in the second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had stitches like Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was tied to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, and then he went to Fener and as far as I know he's not a holder.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone isn't the flag of the real Albania today.
It was apparently the flag of Great Albania, which encompasses all areas where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there wasn't too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not what is called the Great Albania, but Albania before 1913, when the great European Powers decided to give ends to neighbouring countries.
How can we feel "an explosion of joy" by seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How?
What bothers me a little in this "witness" is that the only fact of having been able, would only once, spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, bears witness to me of a "line embroidery" personality whose all "tests" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
No doubt at the short time of "joy", we would not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
It will just be thought, for a moment, that for once Muslims had been able to do truly and apocalypticly wrong to the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
To make qqch powerful.
Great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who feel humiliated.
With filmed testimonies in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfraude.
We were wondering a little bit about that.
The West "Christian/blanc/gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab Muslim world today.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the tours of Dubai.
The shining past, certainly magnified, is not a comfort, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this devilish darkness?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigating the Arab world: the bigot conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (mild or armed) of its critical expression.
That we understand before, we must not turn the Muslims back.
That's the only way.
Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressed months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
The fall is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the breath in autumn.
Not as much to cut off breath as summer's green when everything is alive instead of dying.
In Britain, if you're lucky, the summer falls on a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don't make your little cliché!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to germs outside, it can change, I suppose.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of enigrating smells, with a febrility that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of inertia and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of increases for children , it is the amount charged by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their taxes increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Chart 2 .
The elimination of half of widows in particular is not of all treatment in the article or rather its impact is further assessed: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and assumes that it is painless.
And he's not ready to make it.
Well, we're not on straw yet, but we're dreamers.
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we're not going to cry...
It is clear that those of the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let us continue and encourage these 20% unless we work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I still say it.
Live the Trots and OICs recycled to the PS: they understand everything.
Adam, you look bad at what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from raising as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit the money loses all its utility.
And once money is spent, money is no longer used to make money, i.e. to do the worst of the most.
We're among the richest 20%.
Probably also 20% of the households that work most (and create wealth of which a part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to take advantage of part of their efforts.
Either so lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of the head cutters at the red Khmer have happily lived.
I made two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we would not have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to present ourselves at the reception or face the least anxiety.
Just go to someone's house, sleep in it, keep behind yourself and go away.
That will be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, the people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need a type of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Oh, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" It's not true.
You've just really missed a chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, the response of Airbnb to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm looking forward to paying a bill and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Supporting the troops," sang the Bu$herie on all the tones...
Inoffensive weapons, then.
I am sure that it will please families and close to thousands of Kurds killed in Halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
In addition, how would this mass crime in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not super clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: It's time to strengthen education, because we're still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if "they" worked 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are now gaining more than engineers.
And we don't believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programs.
But this is not seen because the National Education has no means to provide an office to college/lycée to its teachers, so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay either the computer, internet connection, or supplies.
In fact, it's so much the plank at 17h per week and 4 months of vacation that we can't complete the math CAPES, come, we're waiting for you.
How did you not want to be caught with poorly educated clairvoyants whose parents spit on you by treating you as a handkerchief?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Khurde population can grow better.
Where you can see the Bush administration has absolutely come across.
My first job graduated was in the sale, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a job for which a diploma was needed.
One year later, I saw an ad to be working for the London subway, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, don't worry if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well, or that you like to do.
If I'd stayed in my graduate jobs, I'd still be paying my student loan.
I don't like business so much, so I hope to end up either in the public service or in the academic world.
LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year arrears.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of bisounor sources such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is what we call the diplomas of unemployed.
I have one of these degrees and I'm finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma, but, as the article above says, a good career, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower, but the levels were rapidly rising because in the real world what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate has lasted for years as an engineer/artificial course.
Scientists can't solve all the problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people so that they can get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bisonorine?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about degrees like media studies or whatever the unknown course you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are true sources.
We need people who can explain the big questions to students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Would it not be better for a real territorial policy to defuse Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the end of the Essene and Val-d'Oise make 80km back every day on bicycle to come to work in Paris.
Intra-mural and small belt inhabitants already have many alternatively more practical means of transport in common (métro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
In particular, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
Take advantage of their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found room for a SEUL bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not all right.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other common transport users the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that arise are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these bathrooms, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and fuck off the survival of bicycles 2/ you get full of pollution in the head For me the cycle tracks are pis go, it is necessary to reduce the motor traffic (or urban park type congestion charge), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), make the road code constantly verbalizing (even bicycles to the beehives before the code of the written road for bathrooms 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer areas after the clouded passages, not before or unless the bathroom and scooters do not generate.
The cycle tracks are apartheid, but the urban area needs to be rebalanced.
Nothing on the bike in the Grand Paris?
Not a word on the bike's place in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% of veil displacements is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
In addition to learning what OR reports, EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: this is not Russia.
I'm not sure to love the way the world evolves.
It looks terrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, complaints should be filed first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be dismissed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation that would follow.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, it is the responsibility of the authority responsible for the security of airspace, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been killed earlier, Ukraine was launching into the area of air attacks against rebels, and of course any aircraft could be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in the light of a clear threat or did it choose to play with the lives of innocents for airlines to pay the overflight rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their usurper government / the ultranationalists of western Ukraine - and who want to show in bulk that Putin killed MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
The precedent: a 1986 decision of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the provision of arms by the CIA to the rebel Contras forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not allow this case to go to ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott means in Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far the investigators have said nothing like that.
Calling Ricardo and being such an eco-booty, it's distressing!
Calling Polare is losing the north is joyful.
One question from the cattle: is today's poorer poorer than yesterday's poorer?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book the most forcefully didn't read it!
It's easy to read, I've had a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of production-income, capital-income, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term..
It shows that today's concentration of capital is joined by that of the early 20th before 1914, it shows that it was the 2 world wars that brought down the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you don't say what.
I ask you how long this has taken you to read this tablet knowing that the concentration capacity of an individual has a few limits.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is fair, it can be debated without having read the book of which most of it is to argue in a unique way in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you spent reading it?
Is the central thesis of his paving summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
I therefore agree with the summary of his central thesis, and that is the one that seems to me to be pure fumistry.
The notion of the gap between the rich and the poor is subsidiary.
Has mankind not been enriched globally?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and surely deserves the price.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope this price will not be a burden for the girl and she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of the Western governments who want to prove the old adage that the colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom, but mentioned that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married to 14 years old.
Malala herself is not part of these "colored perverts"?
You should not have any "time of notice" on this site.
You're a horrible pervert yourself.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when he was 14.
She was 15 when we shot her.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and she has the right to decide for herself about her marriage.
However, he is someone unusual in Pakistan, since he thinks women are equal to men.
What she was saying is that an average Pakistani girl should often marry at the age of 14, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it quite eloquently for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married to 14 years old.
Rather disappointed by this season 4 entry and particularly by Jessica Lange who apparently has a little trouble finding her character of Marlene Dietrich's society.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the anachronic Life on Mars of Bowie is simply reversing.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be the last time for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I'd rather have one shot than look at 13 stories spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is about, outside of Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mainly the risks of staging and mounting that were up to me.
AHS has an avalanche of original plans that does not ridicule the acceptance of today's productions.
It escapes me a little from seeing you throw your sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge its quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but you say so well, there are many other things.
It's just not that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series weighs in writing, it wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story, or it's gonna end up like 24 hours.
But everyone does what he wants!
That's why I say "I won't look later" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal.
But then, here, it's just my opinion.
Let's talk less tax increases, please - let's cut in government spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to know about spending failed.
Conducting controversy about relatively minor expenditure positions, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to call for their wishes and for all this time certain, in each camp, make it seem that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and the electors see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
"debt" is assets primarily held by financial institutions in that country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government getting one third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought he was going to use it as a good idea.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to slightly useless wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you get to a figure that makes Labour and Lib-Dem tax quite ridiculous about the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 per year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 pays about £70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vineyard, and it is before VAT.
Nearly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car vineyard.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not if it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that money falls from heaven, or that it's not important to know where billions of books of taxes are going.
How can a unemployed person looking for work at the door to door prove that?
At the same time, 20% of the unemployed would not be looking for, which means 80% are looking for and they don't find.
As a self-employed person, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances of doing so.
Indeed, I haven't had any news from Pole Employment for months, which means that the officers are more involved in control operations than actually getting job announcements back?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough posts, then you have to move from Pole Emploi.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, and in this case we make sure that the unemployed perform their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their title of transport to users of a means of transport, a head of service or are employees of their work, etc.
Nobody screams at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed worth recalling that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not a law expert.
Printing and control is currently taking place, while the Pole Employment is legally close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only the employees, who pay the fees.
Politicians and non-employed French people are granted rights they do not have in fact!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance is involved in the enhancement of wage labour.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then look like the spread of black plague in 1348/9 in connection with war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban this year the Hadj in Mecca from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have received their visa application refused because of their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who hired the smallpox at Mecca in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it to be heartless to propose to prevent the sick of Ebola from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was simple sense but apparently those "knowing" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in tight quarantine.
Nobody gets out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after having contact with people in West Africa, although they took "all necessary precautions".
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is mainly propagated by airlines.
Let's stop them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be immediately put into quarantine.
May the message of the first individual and of the second group (including religious) be delivered to him and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that it is capable of erecting in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far from that design here.
It's only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given premium of humanity, while the religion, from the brain, leads our actions from Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any way put their feet to the Church, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sory the church does not have a limited view of France.
And in the world, maybe this will allow you to touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envisioned it pre-existing to the Christ.
Hillel had already said to him: "Don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you, that's all the Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes well beyond mere reciprocity but introduces the agape.
Your "making progress in justice, peace, brotherhood" but without god?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and the resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain the hero who has disturbed moral laws by redefineing the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to take their place in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France are mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted into force and pushed into immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not inventing itself.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I've even participated in her fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The joys of the computer department block all friendly sites.
Hello, is it £30 and 20% reduction, or does £30 include 20% reduction?
Attention however: the PC version is only for DX11.
It caught me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *fucking *
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they will erase it from your library if they decide to serve against the people who buy it there while they are out of the region.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France in 1940 a "mind land"?
So say, this Nobel prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Is it necessary to love France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano who is already hard to read in French and who describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It'd be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will be able to appreciate M.
Modiano's just worth it, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to visit Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hail to the terrible ones.
Since I've been driving one to Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sportage anywhere.
I think this thing followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or do I flinch like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cider party.
It was brothel.
I've been able to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favourites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were only fans of CAMRA (not to be confused with the fans of the camera).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to the grandfather of a guy to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of beginner I was able to leave with several decent spots.
I hope if I reach 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of bark on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you'll understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you're a little far from the subject.
This famed whole, it prohibits the quests for the Jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
She immediately reports arms trafficking.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping the eyes closed that we get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental counter-sensor: all representative, Muslim or non-Muslim authorities, organizations or associations, having formally condemned the IE and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Anyone who doesn't say consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the Jewish French approval of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they publicly manifest to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt.
In my view, this principle is the denial of the republic and can only contribute to the delisting of French society.
If there is no doubt, so much to say.
Who doesn't say consent, but consent to what?
Consent to a proximity with EI or to the condemnation of the EI.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to care for the goat and the goat.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified to the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must laugh.
What are those threats?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland since they have no seat.
They can do whatever they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good thing in the long term for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to pour a tear for the Workers' Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP that will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMISE" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death penalty for his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some of the Labour MPs are demanding accounts from their leader.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's important.
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Sealing the 8% pumps at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband did.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists, and it did him well.
Yet he is still in high school to be prime minister in 2015 and since he won the leadership of the Workers' Party.
So, by the way, these boxes will be virtual behind every reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "the life of others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
After all, this will have at least a sterilizer effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon makes your book based on YOUR profile and it automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
He's gay as a world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I continue to read pirated files, public domain books or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to propose files without mouchard.
Given the price I paid Kobo, it's without regrets.
I am aware of the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
In your public library, you will notice systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably ridiculous.
For example, “Finnegans Wake” by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Big Data era, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same bacter.
The collection of anonymous data when there's a profile...
Harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is, allows neither the readers nor the authors to identify.
But Kobo has all this information, him.
There have been so many exaggerated, misleading and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government over the past few days that the country seems to be headed by a class of motherhood full of schizophrenic children under acid.
It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It's interesting that some Erdogan partisans think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot a ball in the foot unless you win something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will fight back, so it's actually to shoot a ball in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of reprisals or whether it was merely advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises us is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment to Syria, Israel and the security of the region is today."
The reading of Indian Punchline is strongly recommended to anyone who pays special attention to details rather than to the c*neries balanced by the traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read by keeping in mind the realistic / previous warnings from Iran to proposing Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who seriously fight the horrid secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world into the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to "moderate" non-existent to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial would be required for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should he "be"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the least chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my buddy...
Wouldn't the criminals be just old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, huh?
Especially concerning the Triumvirate of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the 1st World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a pious place of Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there and dreamed of founding there a Turkish empire.
What a joke!
An impressive master of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real one.
What clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that even beats in the womb of a carrying mother.
Lesbian couples may simply be a child desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterilous hetero couples as well.
As for the children!
How shameful to designate them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay the retirement of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
She doesn't date today.
Many women have brought and put into the world children who were not their husbands.
It is still so, we are so done...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, aren't the cosmetics also the marketing of bodies? !
Amaronic Fareinheit...
Of course it is more elegant to make a good in faraway countries via the Internet and Pay Pal than to put his responsibilities and or avoid scandal in another century near home without shouting at that time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done on behalf of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
By the end of the 70s in the Midlands, I saw this only from a distance.
I had to go there all day because I didn't have the right to go there at night!
But if you like that and you listen to music - this music today always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on the football that awaits your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of North England's culture.
No wonder that Paul Mason has taken a good look at the social and political context, he understands things well.
Northern Soul still lives, but it has been vamped by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can put an ear in it if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will once again pass the soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "the same story always," but here's a little article well written and well thought out.
your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I suppose you're happy to have escaped from Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and go down to Wallgate.
They're taking pills.
Whatever the pre-wigan station was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after you bought a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently police series Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy colonize (and that was also the case with Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative got angry and shouted: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (United Nations) said and said: and now that things were clearly established
Israel and the majority of its people have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower the guard ...
That this travels to the Israelis is obvious, it's not the goal sought...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it has always been this way since the policy is globalized ...
There's no way.
In the Israeli-Colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What force report has allowed Israel to be created?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a strong report today!
Do you doubt that?
Besides, it doesn't just work around Russell Brand, but Guardian journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
A lot of what he says are nothing but written pseudo-chomskyists.
That's what proves you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a suite of personal attacks and innuendos (my 13-year-old daughter loves her well, which means it's a matter of immaturity).
A truly vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand says certain truths, perhaps of the truths we prefer not to think about.
Hold on, this feeling is going to be increasingly common!
I can understand why Brand horripile certain: he sometimes speaks in a pretentious way and after all the nonsense of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a populist starting, but all this story of not voting was completely misunderstood by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he has posted, he says that voting once every five years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and restricting the democratic commitment to this is completely unnecessary, both parties (slightly different degrees) governing mainly in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and wealthy, at no time he says simply ignoring politics because these parties do not govern on our behalf: he insists that rather than just vote and disconnect for five years, people should become far more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, and try to influence politics from that point.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that I am politically active in presenting his requests can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are swirling people who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it is reluctant to see all these condescending answers saying that this idiot who makes Jesus tell young people not to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were to debate what it really says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of it and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The matter on the vote was completely distorted.
The need to slip a ballot in a ballot box every 5 years makes me very angry, since my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I contest the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own thoughts and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the type of thinkers and unestablishmental universities from the counter-culture that Suzanne would want to group under the label "stu-chomskyist billeves".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head holes added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russel but eventually became one of his fans and invited him into his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It derives from a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
In my view, this "blouse" reveals that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDVs of the History where business historians have become minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of pre-condensed type Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I saw in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude, as well as Michel Foucault's, a need to take care of a culprit, an emissary goat.
They develop both of the very rational reasonings, but this rationality is based on these emissary bouquets that are the key of the voute of their thinking.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This comes from a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magic thought.
The problem of the report is solved by removing it.
There is an anarchist slope, neo-lib and / or /lib ( the second term marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the State, the first knowing to go to seek the state's help for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not of the state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
His thinking is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it does not stand.
Whoever says he's guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Not much support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of his god of time, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oula, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer enjoy attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he is an original and respectable thinker.
See this horse orchestrated by hard left human science researchers who do not support the passage of relief to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is without limit.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebells", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely unbelievable.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were kind to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think so about the whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the mid-20th century, and I still hear some of them hold violent anti-Blanc statements.
My father's not happy that his eldest daughter was with a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spreads out of big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I was told, the Russians are mainly prejudiced against temporary workers with no qualifications originating in the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians' opinions about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really strange that a stranger told me that I don't support the Chinese, while I met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), didn't keep bad memories, all the people were brave and, in fact, those in London were very kind is the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
If you don't remember who you meet, everyone is brave, how you remember who you were.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of Chinese as some kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Blanches would assault them PHYSICALly.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet she is the mother of all the battles and the justice in France remains manipulated by groups marked to the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the judicial circles are frankly branded right.
When at the judicial union, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of the application of laws in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
The one from the observer's political vision as from the judge's factual interpretation.
It remains the required tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on fundamentals.
The extent of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, makes it possible to distinguish between the error and the partiality of magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice were not divided between these three groups.
Pretentation and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And if this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only through implicitly revealing statistics, she would go from low to low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The one from corruption* of the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of injury* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area considered is that of the removal* of heirs committed to the procedure* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession obtains EUR 150 million in good year, while receiving the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notary.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where it joins the so-called statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogicalist and reticent heirs, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria, then, a developed form of lie?
Of course totally prohibitive prices.
Other equipment to nab the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these tricycles every field, built to fit to its size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the full air as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires, could not.
As we say, the tastes and the colors...
The Tankchairi looks like that Jeremy Clarkson could invent a challenge in Top Gear.
The tankshair looks epic.
I don't think the Whill inventor ever had to clean a dog's hook on a kennel.
I'm sure my sister would love the whole tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The extra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for the longboard.
Here are the hills that they would like.
Prices actually seem to be high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so "you see".
The tricycle of any terrain seems particularly helpful to me.
However, not all persons with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance available to them.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know are necessary for us.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not planned to make it.
I'm CONTENT that the wheelchair "long distance" does not arrive on the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners from the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation, as this blockade inflicts a "collective punishment" on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit from their cement to the black market " ...
That's not the language of wood, rather concrete and armed the lady...
References are here to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners from the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, unacceptable for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The USA has a well-maintained land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Don't forget that when you lifted it, Morsi restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built on the opposite side of the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought about it well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the economy of sharing, with no profit.
Many are looking only for one night on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hope) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
"What does she put in for rent on"?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, if you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% consistent with all the safety rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers to engage in a commercial activity (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (honestly) on Airbnb, In brief, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that ships can be displaced, stolen and reconstituted, sunk, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it she would always be near where you left it.
Or diverted by pirates...

Where are you going to hang him?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty increases in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth among the wealthiest hands is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to fail!
High finance, speculative, plays with our companies, so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, so our food, with our healthcare structures, so our health, with our debts, our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold..
All this for the benefit of those hyper-mega-obsessed money.
To the contrary, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was 2012.
In 2014, he appointed an ex of the Rothschild bank as an economic minister, a history of better defending the interests of bankers, solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else competing?
What do you call it, return his jacket, lower his pants?
Primary response and populist
Actually, we don't know much about Marine Le Pen.
Where did you see this?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee has really "refused" to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cooking in the area.
The sea was horrifying at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the photos showing the survivors being dried up, we see a calm sea and in the middle of the day.
Moreover, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two curated cruisers, who had disappeared in the black after stopping the shooting, and a race-for-a-step began.
Leipzig saw something in the fire, but when he got close, he saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives on the Monmouth, weighed and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his spotlights on the ship's flag, the proposal to go was refused and he opened the fire, finally casting the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged Good Hope to have escaped and stopped the searches at 22.15 p.m.
Concerned reports indicating a British embroidery in the surrounding area, he turned north."
So, if this is true, the Germans, in the dark before the radar invention, did not know that a ship had flown, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important leather from the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in the confusion they fled to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should take a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and had cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
A number of votes are put to the UMP to request that it be included in the law that a definitively convicted elected person be thus permanently ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch the left-wing electors well on.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR SOME IDEA, I PROPOSED A CRIMINATION OF THE MAGISTER CONSENTS
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated among citizens?
Maintained by politicians (es) whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to love those themselves who will take advantage of their inmovability to hinder the actions of true policies, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilisity is to the extent of their sufficient.
I met them in the subway about noon with their little banners" of bass for justice" they came from province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing, or even far-right unions were targeting the people on its edge and waging a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are totally free.
If, at the moment, the right-wing is dealing with judicial news, it's just that she's committed facts that make it happen!
There is no example of left-wing personality that has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have paid attention to it have not been treated with favor.
On the other hand, it should be remembered that the judiciary union on the left is not the only judicial union and that it is a minority.
Let a minister support the unions with so much commitment to show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you are quoting may be minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at Chancery, it is not a secret.
We are now wondering whether the "mission" of certain judges is not more to come out than to instruct.
@gus - You should be satisfied, the MS is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever come back?
Hello, Katie Wasisl.
I think even the faintest of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Directions fill the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of disks or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is, in fact, part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision competition, as well as so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and the rest participated in US competitions.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars on British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that is what happens in any way to most of the stars who do not participate in the competitions.
Rare are those who, after a tube, manage to do other things.
In any case, most singers/groups can best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name, has just fans in the UK.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead on a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar frimers who smoke grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a poem primary school will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the people studied – distance that turns fast enough to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present us these distant people as infinitely superstitious and stoner of ritual mustaches, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, from practical considerations to daily.
Except that you interpret unwisely in the opposite direction.
But rather than saying that the drum is unholy, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our form is as recalled to see the sacred as a sort of well-defined object circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article no matter what.
It's the ephemeral deco to furniture the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred lives forever.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would bring to the horizon interpretations not of any scientist who lasts the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When does a comparative criticism of disciplines make us laugh a little bit?
Because what is worth for archaeology is also true for interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that constantly discovers treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, to understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today we have so powerful technical and scientific means that the interpreting of the excavations is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
We are there in the midst of (and old) controversy over the shamanism advanced by prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The Flames of Prehistory", especially the enhanced re-editation of scientific controversy, published in La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this article strongly instructive
Heter men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get into it.
So it's over with us?
I don't really understand why can't we go on to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canyon?
No, but we're not against a play on it.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy over there, but it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, I suggest you move to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all search for a newspaper that pays for real journalists, brave, to write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and dangers.
Rather than getting these powdery ass jokes to scratch.
Not very clever.
Then go away.
If these "puerile ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people make fun of it?
However, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
video crash amateur on the net...??
If the FOM chose not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case that of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, it would have gone out of the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g., a repairer) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon we knew it was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (tele right, pub, money...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
See, I also share that opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brought in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the rest of the chance to beat the English that led then...
You leave my dear Dayrton on this blog.
But it's not serious, I've got a little time to figure out all your c*****ries.
No, just not.
There were lots of conspiracys in F1, but never one that put Commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of a pilot's chance to win at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out safe because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In the light of amateur images, the lack of image enables the AIF to avoid embarrassing questions of the type: How the Commissioner is acting as a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the AIF blocks the images of the accident but because we clearly see one of the Commissioners waving a green flag, signs that the race can normally resume and that we are more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark disregard for the F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, from where the green flag shakes.
It's the usual procedure.
The position of commissaries just downstream of the accident (as the case may be at 10 meters as at 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism sells the pub.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that, in the end, it's just money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having sex, the pub and the media are good for selling things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Doing the buzz with information we don't really need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so we can keep controlling them.
"When tabloids kill about Ebola, we catch all the fear" This should be "draining", not "suffering".
Given the medical reference, "touching" is much better said in this context than "derailing".
I wonder if all the people who are worried that Ebola could spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ébola and Murdoch...
Super article, thank you!
A short and concise article that mocks beautifully and firmly this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
It's depressing for the media to talk about most of the things with this optimism in the background.
The goal is once again to keep us scared and anxious enough (without getting to the hysteria) so that the government can tear us up when it needs it.
I believe that it is perfectly logical that, if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have a crisis of Ebola in the absence of any proven cases?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still from this world almost 35 years later.
In addition to the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going through it for years .....
Testimonial perfectly useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies of nothing: taken isolated, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot serve as scientific material.
This may be why we stop asking patients in psychiatry when we have reliable comments from close relatives.
My psychiatric record says my psychiatrist mother explains that I was educated telepathically by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's crazy, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
What are you looking for, then?
On ghosts?
Are you putting the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the word canon adulated by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after having read D'ensembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of meaningless buzzwords at the psys.
Cyrilnik struck us with "resilience".
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have given us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think about Team America?
Seriously, it's not *no* good idea to show up the Sentinels of the air...
So why?
It was a great series, and it seems to me that those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to all-powerful who can perform miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the humorous genus pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
UKIP works for the Mysterys.
So keep your America Team.
Still in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if we do not see the children and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although an adult), but I hope it will give the idea of a chain to recast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we have episodes of one-hour Saturday and Sunday at 06 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and can always be seen on these schedules.
And more than half an hour's episodes now pass at 05:30, Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a "sorry" guy, 60 years old, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all Israeli excavations below and around the splinter mosque for decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists is elsewhere.
Can it be in Argentine??
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the splandle of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rocker, is out in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad is set up in paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham nearly sacrificed his son Isaac there.
From the moment it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remember it regularly, and unfortunately they are connected to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan in 2 states, and tasted it continuously!).
It is also worth showing how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God recognize his people?
The shortest of Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
In order to boast tourism in Israel, we are often shown young natives half-witted, English-speaking on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as we can see in the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary though.
And this picture is a magnificent piece of propaganda!
It is a shame that the photographer of Reuters did not take photos of the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to enter the Mount of the Temple and who prefer to calibrate the Jewish faithful in contrabas, praying to the Wall of Regrets.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it's right, it's neither the newspaper nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that we must condemn.
This system is untenable and will end up crying.
The only way to put an end to this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to have gone bankrupt, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they have the chance to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever more pay to the small elite at the top.
You're right, it's not tenable, but it's only going to change in this country when the workers really talk about one voice.
Instead of laughing and moaning when someone else makes the strike, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that we don't get rid of people impunity.
Unless democracy is abandoned, in which case if it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where the social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
All this can't end well.
It's because we're in democracy that we held it.
Have you voted for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Partnership for Trade and Investment (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people in short-circuited national governments by secret courts.
This seems unbelievable, but that is exactly what the investor-State dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we're starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
That's what makes great impact, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman was right, in 18th there were unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave it (finally, his officers, the others, no one knows anything) to believe the safe-hold of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and shut its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of the Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more uncomfortable...
They still miss you the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what yet
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm syndicating.
You've been warned, it'll be your fault.
In order to defend the interests of the categories, the protected professions with trade unions have already suffered enough, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of the risk on the part of an employee.
One can well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster assured.
And with the carts ready, the government welcomes this.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other civil servants, since this is the subject discussed here...
We delete "through his delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and business management."
This is absolutely essential with the disruption of the computer power.
And yet you have opened, likely read and commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review".????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding that I've been watching, and I can tell you that some people have been well-seasoned.
In Joffrey's marriage episode one of the best moments (what was misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, of the cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the worst baker; no one has done "boum, here my fucking cake now boil it and bow before your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure of friends and parents out finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outside persons were kept away.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears the last week.
I like to cook, but I don't think I'm getting that.
I am grateful for those who do so and thus offer us super entertainment and encourage us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge last year, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually spend days doing them and they had to break one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to leave, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real fault they could have found was a little dry base (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green glaze on Richard's mill gave no desire, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem somewhat artificial because of the time spent.
There is also the cancer that looks at, with solar wind blows.
Definitely, everything succeeds at the moment.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
The UV is primarily blocked by the ozone layer that is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "cast out" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and thus less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block the UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we are limited to humans, they are in the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and allows the UVA and most UVBs to pass.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor as a remainer when you post a comment?
Especially for minor accuracy, which was subjugated in the commentary, which he himself intended to be a pedagogy.
Without saying that I am a melanoma habit, UVs only make ACCELAR its development.
They don't bring him up.
For evidence: not all bronzed persons must have melanomas.
Either, when a tomb tells you that you must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for all humans.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have determined that everything can be folded if there is sufficient force and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use it is intended for.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as the first-line communications equipment.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested have determined that everything can be folded if there is sufficient force
Except a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
This is a joke in every debate.
I decided to count them.
It's the fourth joke on folding that I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we see little of how it could come back there.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.............
The most likely thing is that it is a production unit on which the iOS was not properly installed and which is therefore matched with the installed factory test code.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or EC logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we're surprised that industrialists produce in » industrials' We put forward super u but all the teachings and even the small trade are concerned How to market good, bio avac €1650 (average salary in francs)?
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After everyone is free to put their priorities where they hear it.
For my part, the diet is one.
Come on, no offense, I'll kiss you.
It is called boboeclos, or better boboeclos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It's the total thought-ray degrouping.
They are gesticulation experts, for example claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferie, joining in this the left-caviar, of which they are sometimes from, for example by condemning CO2 releases while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartufairee as well are not surprised to meet frequently criticisms about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theorization as well as for all related details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboécoles are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
And well, you're able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were to be interested in the greens at all times.
The boboécolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the echoes because it is the one that infects the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front.
She's so badly hurt that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment as you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering of great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's pigs.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That's not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you could appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing billiards.
Judging art may be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than simply representing the real.
If you're looking for this, a camera will do the case.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are still savings to be made: riding activities, the number of Republican guards horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service...
L(honestity requires that France decrease its workforce, but as all countries have, sometimes even more drasticly, started with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, he finds his limits quickly!
A unique approach, at the time when we observe weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow to the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuarization?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to make savings but especially not at home, it's really not possible at home...
That's exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the library is certain.
That all those who have cut the military thing little or enough dare come here to say, eyes in the eyes that there is no money spent in this perimeter and this without laughing...
Applying the same potion to the entire public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: watch the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why Defence can feel a little busy!
Well, yes, the savings everyone agrees to say that they have to be done, but it's got to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moaning at murder when it happens to them, poor darlings.
It would have to be done, but above all, because in this case it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, come on!
How will closing Grace's Val weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, the story is repeated at every post closure, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It is strange, a mayor UMP who wants compensation and does not enjoy the savings made in the public spending.
This article is really the most harrowing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad jokes.
It's the depress to show his Facebook thread and see that 80% of his friends started their statutes with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie.
It will probably be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus going to work and finds out only where his skirt went back to his ass.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely messed up.
Not really, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to hide his emotions and to tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
No computer.
Oh, my God, I have to watch this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really just shown that he's all at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm going back!
It is absolutely necessary for me to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illumination and discover the incredible radiance and insurmountable genius that freezes from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really empty.
Especially if they are neither women nor transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows positive developments within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associations.
Until the next order we are confiscating the right to save our planet by states that play the truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things into our hands.
With the Commissioner they have planted in energy, all these beautiful recommendations have flown on ....
Translate: Eoliennes and solar farms are the round points of tomorrow.
All financed by the co-taxable.
I ask you to stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the chain is not mastered in its entirety, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, it drastically reduces our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other stages.
Electricity by wind or PVC is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittentness.
To replace nuclear with wind or PVC would be against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am a State Doctor in physical sciences 1981. Moreover, I have done research in nuclear physics. I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I have said.
For what I didn't say, you're the one who gave me ideas. I didn't say anything about Germany. You didn't actually respond to what I said and how all right-wing people demolish the speaker I never did.
I also refer to the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: the current German renewable energy programme is a non-profit and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count greenhouse gas vapour of less effect than the Co2 is true to the two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part of water vapour and a little in river water.
I stopped reading when you spoke about Pakistan as a "genant of South Asia" ...!
The last time Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most of the Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had qualified India as a giant in South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandore full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was amazingly interesting, Kolkata's Athletic imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
Compared to the billions that India is dedicated to the IPL cricket and now to football, how can we one day compete with our "screaming neighbours"...
The low cost runner race pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the lack of possible design occurs only with too cold helium.
So maybe we're not in a design flaw, but in implementation...
unlike arianspace which is a private society, it seems that seduz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as the state here is its own insurer..
They may be paying for the frigate satellites they know..
This is all the more unpleasant than many media loops the only titles of articles - and many readers only hold these titles.
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
In agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, it is unfairly jeopardizing the project while it is only a launch problem.
