Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
The MPs refused in second reading the proposed amendment to reduce the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having reached a disadvantageous prior agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The trial is not final and the court is due to rule on the defendant's appeal in December.
Tymosenko has qualified the judgment of political vengeance of the regime and has provoked a process of suspicions of bias of the court in the west as well.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
Libian liberation or rebellion has already defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to be determined by the victors.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has ruled the usual law of the Sharia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a country free of crime because for a robbery we cut our hands.
Women can forget emancipation, the possible non-respectors of faith are subject to capital punishment...
It is the Qur'an that will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society made up of opposing tribes.
In Libya it will reign as we cannot represent it and as we would certainly not love it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and it would probably not be advantageous for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted help with recognition from unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who directed the strikes of NATO but rather Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every attack.
When it comes to looking for the victors in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam and our pellets turned away from the dictator as a political ally without bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly engage Libya.
So there's no problem for the premises to get rid of "crossed".
Without land occupation, oil companies will easily have access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of the protection of those concerned with human rights.
As long as we're preventing these Charia followers from us.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eye of investors.
A round of statistics took place on Tuesday in Europe.
Each of the states published GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, France's GDP by 0.4%.
The two countries modified the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better placed than expected (a rise of 0.3% instead of 0.1% expected), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was a question of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that there is a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy experienced a growth of 0.5% in the third quarter according to planned and recalculated data on a regular basis.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which was what analysts had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year bond performance is 28.45%
The yields of the obligations of Spain and Italy are rising to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields of the Czech obligations remain below 4% while the situation worsens in the region.
A vote was heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate qualification for 200 million
The representation of football has succeeded its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Cech and guardian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also very fortunately defended its qualification in the second part and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second part.
Czech representation also gained thanks to the super Czech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
The Montenegrains were under pressure up to the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The vicitems of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to Super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and also a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams had difficulty building combinations and the game focused mainly on the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not come to perpere the Czech defense that answered precisely the long shots even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield
Hundreds of senior school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in this way in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
Students prayed at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
Hundreds of students from universities in Ispahan have created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre in Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
In this way, they openly expressed their support for their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran had not ceased to strengthen its nuclear armament.
A possible attack on Iranian nuclear institutions is reported in Israel.
Students prayed at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose objective would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
Food of an obese child: don't take breakfast and take carcuerie for dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolers weigh above the average and 5% are obese.
As the current research shows, obese children come from families who have a unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important the environment in which the human being and the models around it are.
In obese children's tables, for example, there is 50% more carcuerie than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey carried out with an awareness-raising action "Obesity is not an accident"
In small families sports is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% answered that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and attended 900 primary schools in Czechia.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not an accident", supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever society.
Since the beginning, there have been more than 12000 sixth to third students enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes dramatic increase in the number of children in overweight, or obese, is the absence, proper diet, and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch-eating- dinner, which is a basic principle of good food," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and dinner cake
Specialists draw attention to the fact that in order to have a healthy development, we need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czech, only 23% of students' families eat at the same time.
In most families each takes his breakfast alone.
And the worst one is that one tenth of the population don't eat breakfast at all.
Yet breakfast is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that obese children's families are more often consumed with malsaine fries.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks drink every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned do sports regularly but for parents it is only half, 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food on the basis of opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"Czech children's preferences between 12 and 15 years of age are far from sound food, ideal food."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of cakes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is particularly a great preference for sweet lemonades", is indicated in the results of the investigation.
For lunch are the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want to be fertile and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Head of Health
The investigation also showed that children are prepared to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obésité is not an accident", a strong determination was made to move towards a healthy diet," the results of the investigation were indicated.
For example, the most significant was for sweet lemonades, as children have begun to give preference to consumption water.
The children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread and potatoes flours).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little upset that there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what would happen next.
The presentations of three specialty professionals, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we approach final exams and the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "sweet."
This time we have with Director Alenka (at the course there are no boys) treated how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, no particular curve, another one of the overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically minimize wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to highlight the character nicely and also not to dress too visually of women types such as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and tight hips and a fine size.
If there is, for example, a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or trousers do not pass at all, that is worth doing it in measure.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccablely is invaluable.
In a fit fit you will feel a lot better than in the one that slips continuously, rolls and does not hold to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance, they can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of sewing fabric, or embroidery.
Of course there are many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that because of what I have to do at home, there's too much.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode and its appearance.
I should "dress" Miranda Kerr, which you may know from the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
Deep down, it makes me happy, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred pounds lately (don't take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not dress only physics but creates, for example, productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphicist, has entertained us with all this.
But this... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three speciality guests gave a diversified aspect to the Saturday session, filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, fashion graphic Jakub Polanka and Ben Renc, mode photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one dress differently.
Variability is for this primary example.
As for example, this braid-coat that should be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but it can also dress up the naked body, with scratches and take it as a dress.
Or just go up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with that" he emphasized.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start against it," Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what to, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variety of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (including a dozen models) I have to be ready to "get back" at least a fortnight.
Also, a dress and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on this during a model creation.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing made her a world star.
In Czechia, the approach to the use of stylists' services remains frivolous.
And the known faces sometimes regard them as useless (I just know something but what I thought is going on in the second place).
And if someone gets to do a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he tells us with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we just have to sail on the google and make sure that the boulevard info reveals the celebrity in question, whether it is thin or thick, etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday about the heart that it's not enough for the stylist to get in the fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he clothes and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
You know how to guess people, don't flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out his wardrobe and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything and tell him, My God, what a horror."
"You'll find some nice things you'll find and him you'll advise them with," Mario said.
This has shown us concretely what everything has to contain what is called the "placovka" or stylist bag.
That's the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, rollers for depilation, or even feeding pins, there is also nylon wire (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not usable because they might lower the clothing) or a sewing kit.
So that we may not only dream of people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way, they have taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could subside, at fortori outside.
And so we got caught and stuck.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so that we would not inadvertently hurt each other.
So there is a real need for skills.
Mario was pleased when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm reporting isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a little summary of what we learned during the second week-end course
I'm starting to increasingly understand that styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run fights across America.
By Way of Review
Originally, a smooth race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
This fills up to a certain extent the ambition of each but it is no use if no one wants to do anything more.
The new sub-titled part The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new lead with the already old Need for Speed race series and get a kind of game out of playable parts that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the passages will be added in which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different than expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games, but the whole goes down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really errors but instead the expression of incomprehensible fatigue on the part of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure where the main hero Jack has character problems and to settle them gets involved in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive the first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten steps and then over 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the steps planned in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player doesn't have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are overcrowded pretty even though the graphic technical level is of the same type as previous series.
Finally, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are more than timed with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that reduces you significantly the visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Next to that, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There's only a small number but that's enough.
There are moments you try to overcome the number of opponents (like in a classic race) then you run against the watch (conventional duel with the chronometer) and then again wait another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the passage away from the vehicle.
Rather, it's an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs in front of someone and you have to help him by taping on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What's surprising is that there are fewer moments of this kind than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is as good as that because this element is not likely to disturb and, in the context described above, places itself in the elements that please the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that there is nothing extraordinary at present, but it cannot be said that it is negative.
With regard to realistic simulation, you will have to go to the other side.
But although we can find better in competition the driving model is very good with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after some time.
With the difference of the driving model, the collision model is not yet in place.
We don't expect this game to be a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have, in a collision with any object, the least idea of how your car behaves, it's not completely good.
During tight overruns you touch each other sometimes slightly but otherwise your car goes in crazy voltages.
Or you'll find yourself in my crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really upsets you.
The rebooting is done so that when you have broken the figure or you have gone out into the decor the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 reboots.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen as it should, that something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarting does not help and the solution must be found by recalling the piece of itinerary in question.
The big part of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that have to be passed in a certain way or that does not happen.
Otherwise you will meet on a specific location of "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute in delay.
What angers these are the situations when you see easily passing the opponent between two cars coming in reverse direction and when you arrive, you either have to stand aside and turn them around or cool them.
It's the same if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens near your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
All the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without care of the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This pisses the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long reverse bridge.
The opponent must come in front of you at all costs.
When he passes in front of you he hides the view of other vehicles in reverse direction and you collide a lot of times.
It may be understood that the goal of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You have to pay attention to petrol pumps on the routes because you can change it by car however most of the time that you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for right highways and super sports cars with exotic attractions on very technical roads, for example on lactic roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places you know about adventure, is very good with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest driver level, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects with Autolog function that, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation in the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (ca looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (ca looks like).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you arrive a subway line that sends you the car directly to the railroad.
To the writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone actually thought about creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is uncomfortable is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This applies mainly to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is on the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the most young audience, a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confusing.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it's the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
Fun is really good, but prepare yourself to get the mistakes in your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vice-nova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs act as negativists and Eurosceptives
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically abolished the balance between institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players are used to their new role", and Miléna Vicenova began her presentation to the Faculty of Law of the Czech Embassy near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various bodies of the EU and their relations in such a understandable and visible way, to the extent that a large number of speakers at Charles University's Faculty of Law could send it, she showed how much she takes her motto "understanding and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms that it's fade were echoed, that it's a round-tail, that it can't complete any mission and I have to say that it cut the breath to everyone because it has its role to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, well communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of an answer to the question "Who is in the European Union?" "What telephone number do I have to call?", so as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater legibility of Union policy in the face of states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our syrecky (cooked cheese that feels very strong)
Ms Vicenova also mentioned the agenda she has lived, lived and will live in the near future of the European Council.
It qualified the Czech Presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It called the fall of the government of very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of Mrs. Ambassador, "the activity has fought its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to solve itself now.
Moreover, the new EU septimal budget which has become very complicated because of the current economic situation needs to be approved.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and for savings, which sector will have priority, which countries will help most, at least, all is to resolve in future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornicones, bananas differ widely, or that no one has forbidden us to do syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multispeed Europe awaits us
According to the Czech Embassy, they have the reputation of being Euroseptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
Her view was that there were several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when you come to me the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French tells me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group of Visegrad still doing?' and he's not happy.
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future these are tough new budgetary policy rules that await the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at several speeds, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the enhanced cooperation institute."
First of all, it was said that the countries that want it and those who do not want it remain in their corners."
"There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a really two-speed Europe," Mrs. Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and of Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis for all themes with an impact on the EU to be discussed among all EU members and not only the Eurozone members.
History of a brand:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone was to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy at the very close, the closest would be "the long term".
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved so that people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the footprint around which will develop the life of a giant future (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM started to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the company's culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because it remained faithful to its core values and yet it was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more "declared for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to look after his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only ones among the first U.S. employees to have paid vacations, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee's uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and custodians.
Similarly IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The society was at the beginning brilliant in the discovery of talent- as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - which should replace Palmisano with the head of IBM.
The company has been working at IBM for thirty years and is currently in the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM over the past few years has done what is called hamy, brain-storming online from which many future strategies and innovations are derived.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the company's internal and external image that ensures a safe position in business.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard Economics School and author of the book on IBM.
"IMM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems by using its technology," added Geogre Colony from Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiar to the United States in view of its slogan - in 100 years it has grown to become one of the largest firms in the world.
Of course, it is the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, services of the server's products to nanotechnology.
It has numerous patents from all American technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
His discoveries include the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM was found this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it passed in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview in progress
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the client and of the time - IBM for example has failed to bet on a OS/2-specific operating system, the Online Prodige service or IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the forward movement you can't emotionally stay stuck on the past," noted Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike for example the Microsoft concoct that stands at the base and remains under the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for one fifth by software and hardware, have a dominant place.
However, even in 1990, it was with more of the strongest motive of participation representing hardware.
Since 2000 IBM has sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, over the past period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its volume of investment.
Now it appeared that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The IBM share price has increased from 2008 to 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
For this reason, we can expect this flexible giant to have control over other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago, initially having the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She was named IBM in 1924 - originally a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the fusion of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as old "pointers", pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 presided over the Society's Board of Surveillance.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then made shadow to the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that so far rest on the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the Kusqu's firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - from cheese and meat cutters to registered boxes.
During the first four years during which Watson was leading, the turnover increased to up to $9 million and the expansion of the firm began in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership it was his son who occupied the chair of director Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s people and computers of IBM helped NASA guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers company and began to deal with advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded IBM in the last three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as IBM trade is concerned, it has recently developed a "Smart Commerce" platform that helps businesses manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history also in our territory.
She created her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first Central and Eastern European country.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central and Eastern European Central is based in Prague and there is also the research and development team at the global level that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
You can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
Only she was unable to wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova took refuge in the summer in Bartosova in her home, she did not doubt that her couple would not have to stay.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not reject the singer.
And he publicly confesses that he loved him.
Over time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's connection and ended up saying good-bye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome her at the door of the house.
"He is my son's biological father and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova allowed to filter by showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina shut her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The society continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we're discussing completely normal but we're not sleeping together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop him.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in knowing where she goes, who she goes, and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take all responsibility on myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Is this also about you?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, like each other, are able to "get them out of their sleeve".
My dear ladies, you will find out in the following lines of the female vices who are able to pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchases
Does your half give you comments that you're dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and buy packages at the time of the balances?
In your case, you can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women believe that they should restrict their passion for making purchases.
But you will say, which would resist the winery of the clothing stores, look for yourself with nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
Although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he's waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"Would I need to lean at least five pounds - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these phrases remind you of anything?
Yes?
You are therefore among those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop caring for yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partners are always complaining about their appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and women become poisonous.
Odre and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite manage.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, make the dust, dig the bathroom - and this twice a week.
You make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean ground, to the children that they have dug out the sink, pasted the window of the living room, and that this gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be overstated and that order and cleanliness should not be at first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The work of the sword
"Put this worn overcoat to the trash."
"Are you going to put those old socks on tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do with land."
If you do this work on your partner this way several times a day, you're really going to break it down.
It's obvious you don't think wrong you want everything to be flawless.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much soap work...
Defamation, Persiflage
Defamation, persiflation, but also insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and thus are happy to deal with subjects such as, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets us escape a little harmless persimulation here and there.
However, the hand on the heart is a woman's particularity.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflate, even despise others and are for their surroundings - especially at work in a group of women - especially dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in Philadelphia's victory
Hockey attacker Jagr participated twice in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL Monday match on Caroline's ice and is again leading the Czech productive players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who still made an extra pass and was named the best player in the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also recorded two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told the extra-Atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game he'd give his hattrick."
"I heard him."
"Sometime this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal of the first shoot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the pallet and presented it to the Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer descended, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Incrementally to Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really happy about it."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL the other players on the team tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ended with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read didn't miss out on other complications that ended two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) left to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory in the head of the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montréal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out in second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens did not face an experienced defender their advance of two goals lost after a 2:3 penalty shot.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It's the fact that the back line was sick that mostly kissed the local coach rather than lost fists because they only played the match with 5 defenders.
"It's null."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement is not enough and we have not been able to resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the thirtieth Winnipeg attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the Uax goals of the Jets, which arrested a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time proposed trips mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled to East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a slant for the west and trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, in Poland or in the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter or the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however, it was necessary to tail all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't yet won.
The agreement for currencies which was the condition to travel to the west was denied to people "politically incorrect" who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasted until now.
The Czech travels have since experienced a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at most, Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world.
The great paradox we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The removal of visas in the last 90s in the neighbouring countries of the West caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not for a long time travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, in Paris travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our incomes did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a trip of Czechs was at that time to take with itself his own food canned, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the exchangeability of the Czech crown which enabled our tourists finally after decades of freely purchasing Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage have increased what caused another important time around 1997.
With a growing demand for travel, travel agencies have been preparing rounds since 1997 with air charter links that have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
In the late 1990s the Czechs had visa-free links with almost most developed countries around the world but the EUs that later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to faraway hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100,000 Czechs who visit exotic countries each year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to settle completely in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for vacation abroad including attached charges.
The General Assembly must find its President but this could end with a situation without a solution "a bed"
Nearly 5 months already Czech football is without President and the successor of Ivan Hasek to the head of the Czech Republic Football Association is not yet known after yet a General Assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting rules must be adopted.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in Czech football management.
Hasek resigned in June, and during his departure, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the year after Hasek the football went back towards differences between the Chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16 when a new president had to be chosen.
Delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation was blocked and there was not even a question of dealing with the way to choose.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, like it, the statutory representatives or also the officials invested with full powers.
In this only point, there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the assistance of the Office for the Status and the Law, that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Divergences still continue with regard to the settlement for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also failed to contribute to the situation
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the nebralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The disorder apple is the following: whether to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, the third round of candidates who will have received the most votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate will be awarded.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to retire to win the candidate who will receive the largest percentage of votes from the two chambers.
And the Czech side studies the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the votes.
"It would only then lose the idea of two previous laps and this would completely refuse the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, which includes the objections of the moravian party and that it would be better not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also in agreement even if he considers that the settlement of elections based on the most advantageous status Pelta among all candidates.
"I wish to vote at most according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet any bloody ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner who was a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations was mainly defined against Pelta.
There's still a lot of optimism.
According to him in Nymburk, there will be a new President and he believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification at the European Championship today should calm everyone".
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation" adds Jablnek's officer who, among the three, has the greatest experience in managing football both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are trends in wanting to change the regulations to drawing."
"It can again cause a blockage in the General Assembly."
"I still hope that the sound reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement on all sides.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but which can tell if the entire course of the football will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take a part of the executive committee on the field of reprisals.
At the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister for Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parties in the country's strongest sports association and to bring them into agreement.
In the game there are many: a state allocation, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union, which must determine the management of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the battle for the President's position because he sees no proper candidates.
If the leader of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile had responded to everything he requested for a new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association (AFRT) he would not be put in a campaign for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the present situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik to the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of AFRT that would priorly be favoured for this election.
Paclik also stresses that if he won the elections, he would hold this position as President only until 2013 as scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see well in the function an experienced and high-level manager who is not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said to be particularly awkward, Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Roman Berbr Regional Football Union, a man to the renowned contraversa who is known in the backstages as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupy this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-flight merchant, it would be even less favorable to football," Paclik proclaimed.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of hearing in an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta went without a penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
If Paclik triumphed on Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
"He has great capacity."
"He would be able, for example, to present himself as the leader of the representation."
"But as the manager of the Association, he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he decided to cancel the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macella, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He took as an example his ability to run private companies and he has also been leading the Plzen Club since last year, which had held his first division triumph with his support in May.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and bring it a certain culture."
"I would slow down the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," Paclik added, who did not seek his antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power with high-level policies would allow for more sport of gambling tax money.
"This is one of the key points the new President should take care of."
"If it's the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current connection with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the president of AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again connected with Jablnek and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"That's not the ideal."
I see no reason to convey my actions to someone at Plzen's club if I have to come back a year and a half after," Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to bed situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates to the Miroslav Pelta Presidency promised that if elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end to the dispute about the election settlement in the future.
Jablnek's official is prior to Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that today's success in the football performance should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta, before the election in September that did not take place, has promised to devote itself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the past General Assembly and this two-month delay could enable him to defend his vision of football management and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and wait until there's a president on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the lead of the Association," he adds, but it is primarily related to the Jablneg club, worked a lot of years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That's also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of the Statutes were approved which were not perfect as they all saw."
"If there weren't all these various interpretations, we would have had a President since September," said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took all the attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities in case it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," added Pelta.
He then attempted, it was said, not to confront his opponents.
He had previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his training in law and that he knew in good time that his opponent-candity would be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he long attacked Tonas Paclik who on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and he's already had some success."
"But his attacks were not the most honorable and he surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said at the address of his opponent, but he remains, he said, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from low-level competitions to national representation.
It's supposed to be a football vicar.
"And I would also strive to finish all the cases that begin with that of the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for the whole football," the Czech Press Agency told the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment at the head of football would not lead to any change in people.
"I should get acquainted with all the employees," he told Strahov, where there's a sense of nervousness since there's no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round we will be able to overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and will only get it when there's a new leader," as Pelta optimistically says two days before the likely decisive day for his career as an official.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday, this would not please many people, he said.
However, Rajchl promises that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
It wants systemic changes and makes the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring to football more money and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying that I'm going to do all this alone," said Rajchl in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members takes care of a specific area."
"And I'll distribute difficult missions for football to face a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be to start working hard rather than criticizing others" he added.
He said he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth the shot and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in the wheels and express doubts about each of my actions," he explained why he hesitated.
"A lot of people have said the same thing to me that I must not give up because they would also give up."
"This trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, we say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the last two years, there has been a great deal of de facto work and I don't want to let him down."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them.', he said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union does not return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in a systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him are people who would do football in such a way that it would be only for those who were chosen."
"We can blame myself for a number of things but certainly not to bear any."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for Czechia.
"And if there's anyone who says otherwise, I'm ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts one Czech and the other moravian whose conquerors would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation like at present with only three moravian teams in the division because the current problem is to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech Chamber who elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be success," said Rajchl, who is considering among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contracts with television and the gambling law.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he believes that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has to offer football.
"No one can question Plzen that he has done a great job this year."
"If he was elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a significant change among people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his success," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Patagores in omni optics, beautiful swimming pools in Budapest: Who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his weary legs rest in gas baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the past 18 months, there is an object that should not be missed in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Extended on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged coupons, and was swimming against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and was not missing to admire the Art New meticulously restored from these converted pools.
If a covered pool was pleasant to her, she noticed in her notebook all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were investigated in this way by the historian of Meder architecture and presented them in his book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The covered municipal swimming pools of Münich, the historic bathroom palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
It has led its "travels to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
46-year-old German is a real fervent of the culture of the bath.
Meder, explains that she didn't have much interest in sport but she felt attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is irritating that swimmers must simply look at blue squares and accommodate the Jabel water bridge while the players breathe from the scent smelling of epicéea forests or can listen to the gazelle of the park's cheerful birds.
"I wondered one day why the swimming pools must in fact always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water double strengthens the architecture
A dip in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - a factor of well-being in swimming rooms are enormous because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders were given a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight to the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically double: high vaults, multicolored tiles, tremples.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives a desire to make a jump in the blue.
The Meder collector discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Alongside the splendid well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cellar in the karst (bain of cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath with basins filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the bath of Zürich you have the whole city in your eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can watch the animation on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits the swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an OVNI that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background rises the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of Javel's water does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulphur, from the Arpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekscsaba is a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to find in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also experienced disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool and outdoor of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded land.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
By taking a look at the New Art building window in red-white-jaune, she observed the spreading of weeds between the squares.
It observed an opposite effect in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: The spa palace of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; it is possible to discover not only neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its design in 1844 but also a maureal hall in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it originated from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a good performance to melt construction styles if different in such a formidable unit," said Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank give up speculation on raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group leader then wants to see its consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions break down this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann points out that the speculation of the Scholarships on global raw materials, pushes prices upwards and that banks share a complicity with global famine.
The consumer protection campaign specifically aligns itself with Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, the majority of experts share the view that betters have taken advantage of offers and demands - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently from US competitors: He promised to investigate the complaints and said, "No case worth putting into play the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the charges of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, as usual.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be taken.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his image
The leader of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on the increase in food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how banks today are damaging the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be especially under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments in its portfolio, for which money was invested on food speculation," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about the hungry people or whether the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may appear at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the Group's CEO wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his duties.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything that is foreseen in the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with a abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he has little to care about - his successor will worry about.
One out of two would resolve investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Mardi survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires of 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 percent found this legitimate because Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many bank clients would also benefit from this if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one out of two would, following the survey, terminate all investments for which money is injected into speculations on raw materials.
43 per cent would discourage such a bank from around them, 49 per cent answered that they would reflect on the termination of their account to change their bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with tops, bass and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then collapsed.
It is now again open and has a place of exhibition.
If we are excited about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, glass hangers, lively and daring looks and new building materials that are typical of belief to technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal Brussels exhibition in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once given the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction up to today is considered an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next universal Austrian exhibition.
With its legendary four cylinder house of BMW and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous internationally in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the station in southern Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used for so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has increasingly slowed down.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavillon, now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the museum Belvédère opened the first exhibition to which the house belongs - a chance at any point of view.
The new departure was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted a history of art to a considerable career, among other things, in his youth as an artistic skater, subsequently at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founder director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she has conducted, in particular, the transformation work with political men and the protection of monuments, she has obtained public funds and private sponsorship and has established the exploitation of it.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name were exposed to it, a coffee shop and a bookstore are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the Krischanitz realization, it was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and extended Joseph Olbracht's secession with sensitivity and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "a very important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and his change of use.
In the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a gouffer in energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, the insulating glass reinforced in glass fibres was placed and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal decks were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements have made the place for the new operation, a panel of light slammed between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but always the light Pavillon Schwanzer.
The exterior doors of origin have remained, the house is painted in a shade of protection against the red-brown rust.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision by the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"There are some materials that are good and cheap that should be found, and which also please the office of monumental protection," said Krischanitz, and he draws attention to a gross ground in the ground.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "who came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if this is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden, the "Central Station Quarter" is just set up again, with offices and apartments.
And another chance is perhaps going to happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the center of temporary art Berlin, and as he said, she already negotiates with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million extra this year.
The "Bild"-Zeitung newspaper reported in advance, invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should also make it possible to improve the availability of vehicles and the rail network in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the denial of rail facilities and railways should, inter alia, double and move to 16,000 people.
The objective is to clear snow and ice docks up to the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the necessary track equipment for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the Rüdiger Grube Station Chief warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that took place this winter as well.
Last winter the railway society had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacked other reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For many years, many new regional trains have been awaiting authorization from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years what to do, as it has to check the axles of the ICE trains significantly more often at the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE in the Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is again in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were not already sufficient, the past of this sector giant also caught him in the USA: Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison to $145 million (106 million) to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCAUA financial market regulator carries to large banks a whole series of charges, thus encouraging cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution on this subject, without the parties entering a court proceedings," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank did not recognise any errors in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which has committed itself to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCAUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
NCAUA is trying to repair the damage caused by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks in part and in summer he assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents, this is "Mortgage-backed Security".
Credit homes are at the base.
When the US real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, it is currently blowing a stormy wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought numerous remedies for redress or for the punishment of shortcomings.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the largest wave of complaints.
It complains to 18 large international banks, to the two US real estate finance Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be in-kind advantage in mortgage cases of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with FHFA, which here are several operations totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005-2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific amount.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increased by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests colossal amounts in the IT company of IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares for a value of more than ten billion dollars.
Until then, the big U.S. investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad predictions.
However, he read IBM reports and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
It had already had to be understood much earlier than IBM was proposing mainly services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight's attack in the financial world.
Therefore the IT IBM activity is granted the right to now call itself "Mr IBM".
Because Buffett has revealed today at the CNBC economic issue, which he has purchased since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway thus became a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM never knew anything about this commitment until now.
He commended management, who had made reasonable profits even during the economic crisis.
"You did a super job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time put IT lucrative services as an "exploitation of accounting centres."
The computer pioneer, over 100 years of age, offers both Software and consultation as well as highly performing business calculators.
Buffett had so far instead avoided technology companies.
He says that he invests only in businesses that he understands business.
But on the contrary, Buffett attacks rail brakes, lubricants or machinery manufacturers.
Her Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries and shares with a wide range of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rück munichois.
The 81-year-old took over in the 1960s" the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and erected it in the ranks of one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
Following the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM shares increased by one percent to the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also called IBM, has a stock market value of over $220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
Microsoft says Buffett doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of Zwickauer's cell, Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would be reborn now.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background.
Following this news, Turkey as well as the German-Turkish population reacts with fear and concern.
Because for many German-Turks the spectre that had been believed to have been dead for a long time has been repeated: since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there have been no more violence comparable to this extreme right-wing context against the Turks.
However, there has never been a question of xenophobia in Germany.
The right-wing extremist network, which has been detected, however, reveals proportions of which the dimension is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to the blood ideology", "Tel was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right burber.
It was reasoned that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at the door of Brandenburg.
It was only two weeks before that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought of a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that cohabitation had been set up, symbolizing a history of success.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a gifle: "the gift of Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of the unique conditions.
"za begins at the beginning", such is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He stressed that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums, and they subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why has it not already come much earlier in the spirit of the German authorities to do research in certain suspicious extreme right environments, the authors are surprised.
More than one shows itself ready at least to rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be broken, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defense and armament."
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Inland peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," says Selen.
What this means if inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance by acts of violence could result.
The attacks, however, have reinforced the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes
In the past, it was mainly the failure of German policy after the Turkish press reported: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of the Turkish State, he was represented at the funerals in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel, at the time, in his speech, and he had a number of taxes on the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how much the mistrust of many German-Turks is deep towards the "state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of greater clarification and reassessment of extreme right terrorism in Germany, this time a clear message is needed.
The scandal bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial and skate crisis in the meantime from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After its spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, in July, it was known that it would occupy an almost as spectacular position in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed and praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recent solidity and made pleasant comments on future colleagues.
"The U.S.B.S. has succeeded the Turnaround."
"I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities market in London had diverted all the Bank's security systems and had blown about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has been considered as suffering - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administration presidency in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economy and president of the bank, and he would certainly need a period of adaptation.
He then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
In fact, the UBS is on the big side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand, it has suffered for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing seems to save the proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The Swiss manager's image of assets, quiet and solid, but also Russian, had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the area of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later the bank professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken the UBS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"In today's view, we wonder: how could I have just cheated at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something did not turn around at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising manner, which was so far regarded as a high intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later we felt what the reason he left was for.
The division of the bank had blown off with subprime documents and had to cross billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross over.
For this she actually found investors, but who, a short time before, would have frowned the bats: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which had passed under silence, to the extent that it was never even learned its name.
But that was only the first time.
In April 2008, this worsened.
The bank was to announce again losses amounting to billions, the president of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still the second most paid board in Switzerland in 2006.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, in view of its investment errors, in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and must be saved by the State.
The national bank bought the UBS of tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds into shares, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to shelter so large banks.
Finally, the 2007 UBS balance sheet increased to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We have not been able to save the UBS once again," says the bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second disaster followed.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and had declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy clientele, who had cheated the tax, perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that it has helped to tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
This is followed by the withdrawal of the Chief of the Board and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management because of tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a bit of a calm return, and as we thought, the UBS would come out of it, it followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: one flamenco marketer 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something didn't turn around.
And we publish: with investment bank risk management, it still doesn't seem to work.
"In the case of Adobe, it has been found that the control of risks has changed too little," said Martin Janssen, a economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
So the financial director of a large German bank is sure of this: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not have the control of the risks at hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their place, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unbreakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich is still going to match the solid private Swiss bank cliché - it's just a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Zurich Lake, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's, they're found here among Swiss shops of traditions just like those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the palace of Crédit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a great label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other separated from the market - or betrays the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with both major banks as well.
The UBS would have become too big, it finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And yet, for a long time, they have adapted to the dies of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, made high profits and then the break-in: no European financial institution lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday the small country's government coalition of seven million people has undertaken the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The Fall of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for little Switzerland - and has continuously recorded an increase.
What helped was that the two different predecessive banks of the UBS completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but of course already more highly internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the ascent of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I've always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who set a path to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted himself to the end at Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of the leaders in which the leader of the Wuffli group always made the same order: dethroner Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" classifications, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all the U.S.U.S. wanted to go up and up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the matter of currency and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
The business advisors, who were responsible for this, however, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the "Fixed Income" banking jargon, there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS launched itself in an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Associated with growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has become a massive machine that has packed and delivered value documents based on American mortgage loans - but which has also retained risks.
Even when other banks had been looking for a long time to go down.
"Even in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was on fire, the U.S.B.S. bought there," says Geiger, the bank expert.
The greater the euphoria the greater the fall is brutal.
A manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts, it was harder than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectable and are up to now bank.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration on the management of goods, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to go so far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as this is clear to date.
Next Thursday the bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be transitory when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has been imposed: it must carry out the affairs of the UBS sustainably, the Banque de Zurich communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of play in the mid-1990s.
He cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He says publicly until now only that he was going to look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

U.S. investors have skeptically expressed: "We are not an island, on the other hand, dependent," said Goldman's Steve Goldman.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, and there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was from its point of view too early to invest in obligations coming from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett has cast a ten-year-old principle into the wind and entered the American technology industry.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM has supported the course of this traditional group's actions, and has allowed it to score almost more than 1%, against the trend of commercial management.

Smart horns spread out in cities
In many places, friars are considered "bird problem" but experts claim that these very intelligent animals have not been able to hunt down cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cornels have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are multiplied because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
During the first Ostfriesisch Symposium on the cornellas, experts said it is no longer possible to chase the friars from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
The nature protectors were also based on the problems of cities and on the exodus of specially protected friars: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, setting and slaughtering of typical cave trees made life difficult for birds.
The corneas are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with over 600 cavities in Westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative publicity because of the carnation massacre in that region.
Critics found bird capture in traps and killing them with particularly brutal gourds.
"The normal expulsion, the evidentiance, is useless," noted Leer's planner and landscape, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressure water or to kill trees, often resulting in undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr at Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals go away, the great colonies divide and they disperse in other places."
I can only imagine in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the provenance of animals with deep conditioning and sticky offers to allow them to reinstall themselves elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "info panels instead of stretchers" in order to establish completely different relationships with the: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-in-Educational Corbilles at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent friars.
In the meantime, this project was adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of bird noise: "This is a large number of communications, these birds have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Freux not only use labor tools to arrive at a regal but they themselves manufacture their tools as tools of work.
Ethologists at Cambridge University recently tested four brakes, to what extent the intelligence of the birds comes.
In an experience, the birds quickly learned that they had to make a scaffolding with stones to reach a larvae.
Without much training, they strongly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second test, the cunning corneas then had to solve a deeper problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larvae.
Birds could not reach their target with their beak.
However, researchers had put iron wires at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four brakes were even successful from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo pulls Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks were not successful.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czechia and Ireland will also participate in the 2012 European Championship.

Sena Lulic was confronted by a red yellow card (54e).
Bosnia had already failed in the elimination of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At Stadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a 30-metre-in-a-front shot in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his distance shooting qualities and pulled at a distance of 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to attacker Edin Dzeko.
Ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of Manchester City's English championship, initiated a headball heading down the cross-bar, the balloon did not cross the line of purpose (33e).
Jiracek drew a goal for Czech
Finally, referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the centre of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian Penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card in Portuguese (36e).
On the other hand, Stark awarded a 11-metre penalty to the controversial hand after a action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 vice-hampion of Europe succeeded four times and everything became clear.
For Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended his last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also had a chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
goal guard Petr Cech has prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9e).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the Stevan Jovetic duo and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute rotation on the repair surface right next to the Cech shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the relief of the world class guard of the Czechs already killed, again, the attacker of the CF Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The short-term goal before the end has finally clarified everything.
Turkey was rattling Zagreb's football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink also had to abandon his seat on the 2002 EM Third Bank, the Croats were able to rejoice over their fourth round at the end of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost reached a dream start.
Selcuk Inan marked the seventh minute with a long shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball for the purpose.
After the time of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62 e Minute, the legions of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish have celebrated their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already taken over with a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) equalled for visitors.
Ireland pushed at the top speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy got the first chance.
Only at the last moment that the defence of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the - first buyer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, approximately two billion dollars (€1.5 billion) will be allocated, said the Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and employ employees accordingly," announced PDG Bill McDermott to its clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from approximately 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader of enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
To date, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of SAP's 176 000 worldwide customers are located in this growing country.
China's growth plans are also an important element of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.

"Now, we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The slaughter of personal masses
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that warms your heart.
A tip to begin with: carefully rip this page and make it your own page mark.
You will learn about these people in detail. In this Romanesque account by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the mists of the war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here a book out of the ordinary which he accurately described as "an anti-history book."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is hardly any ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it could look like." There are the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from both sides of the war, from young schoolmen and botanists to hikers, going through doctors, ambulance workers and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose their members, they will become crazy or they will lose their lives.
Their lives vacillate here like the waxes of a church: while some of them turn out, new ones run away.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
He denounced the idea that the First World War was merely a result of the terrible war of trenches on the western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" well describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, the Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under the rocks; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tattered flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the front page.
War invades the lives of such people as a natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina who can cordite it.
When cannon blows are far away, and you are a mother at home, are you staying or running away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been exacerbated by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracyist theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English infantry in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund wrote: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminium, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep's fat (and finished with a false wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried skin of potatoes; seeds of wooden shoes."
He claims that "837 authorized substitute meats are recorded in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse to savagery and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, it is what men were destined to, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, reading a newspaper or best-seller, and rather than claiming that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarous behind your heavy and nailed shirt.
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he is at risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are reluctant to sacrifice ourselves, we hope to have a public" he writes.
Unfortunately, it's rather comparable to "a man convicted in secret".
Other observations relate to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," wrote Peter Englund, "a war among factories."
He seizes the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the beast of the early century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothing, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act in an unexpected manner; there are as many basic behaviors as those of heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid service to the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and spread on genital organs in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness for life."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way in which the war " triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion."
People start wondering why their leaders are making them a war.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West Nothing New", by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming thing I've ever read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come up from his book, grab your hands this page where the list of people and burned with a lighter.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some carrying anti-emoute helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all the errors of a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the outset that they were going to exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the department's regulation and generated a public solidarity storm for demonstrators.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared by observing the conduct of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall, for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - counter-terrorism measures that consist of moving quickly a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held on Monday evening by Manhattan on the East River.
The orders to move to the park were reached "at the last minute," said a person, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I knew and who were called did not know they would go to Zuccotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones to know that they would go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city has learned to hold a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police wanted to clean up the park, but they were repelled by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the district, from dozens of officers who were accustomed to particularly criminal districts.
Kelly said that many people were going to the park during the day, as migrants, so one hour in the morning was a convenient time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The light and recorded messages of loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
While community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue cutter, many protesters simply gathered their business and left.
No attempt was hit before 1h45 told the police, which left time for the occupants to gather their affairs.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson of the head of the police department, affirmed that this measure had been taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention within the park, which the officers had recently withdrawn.
Browne said that the television cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police were moving west across the heavy business of protesters, including luggage, plastic lawn and sheets filled with clothes, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, said Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut chains.
There was no arrest in the park before 3:30 p.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most of them for "strengthening in public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most senior officer to be found on the premises.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "he wasn't managing operations," said Browne.
A second group of police were suffering along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a pastry of houses in the north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south.
We saw the police extend the perimeter well beyond the Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, had even been seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
About 5:00, south of Pine Street, a protestant jumped on the top of a police car. Others were caught breaking down the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood popped up in the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The school aid union continues the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school aid that had lost their jobs last month, plans to bring a trial to the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate to schools receiving disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school aids, parents' coordinators and other employees, being part of the city's least well-paid, lost their jobs on 7 October last year. Trade union leaders compared these dismissals to political revenge for not allowing the city to have access to a health care fund run by working groups, and that would have allowed the budget gap to close last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this charge.
At a hearing of the Municipal Council last month, Chancellor Dennis Walcott said that the dismissals were part of the closed budget in June.
One member of the Council replied that the dismissals of school aid were not specified in the budget.
The Council officers of the 37th District stated that they would complete a notice of complaint, warning the education department that it would be pursued; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to formally announce the prosecutions to the Manhattan Supreme Court of State.
Dennis M. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be the respondent. The complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all of black or Latin American origin, such as most of the school aids that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the legal department of the city, said that the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore could not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union sent the number of redundancies in schools in the most disadvantaged districts of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose most of their aid due to regular underfinancing.
While there is no dismissal on Staten Island, and a few barely in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school grants have lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts in the southern Bronx districts.
Noting the loss of five school grants out of eight employees at Harlem's 36 public school, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecutions state that "This isn't a well-known family neighborhood that can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget for public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each underprivileged student registration.
The union also claims that school directors were able to be misled by certain terms in a memo allowing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memo used the term "extension" to describe the action, even though "excess" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "six parent coordinators have been fired", and "not just because of overrun".
Mission concluded: Congress finds agreement on the question of Libya
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats had reached agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It will take a successful uprising, capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Kadhafi as well as the American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision on Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republicain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "heart".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators of both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve the United States' military role in the NATO mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day as the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of US operations in Libya.
The American mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress was opposed enough to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under foot.
Congress's indecision has been exceeded by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "welcomes the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "welcomes the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their partners in the coalition engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win all the support of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as it was last June?
The Senator and Chairman of Commission Richard D. Placer (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the project.
In the Capitole, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other question, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have not so far succeeded in having their amendments approved, but this is not without trying.
The Goodlatta amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to be tabled at Congress, on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slightly different from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the Chamber only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle that would "control federal expenditures".
Some of these bills are identical, but they provide support - especially the new Republicans who want to spin their CV - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, approved last August, called for the House and Senate vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to raise the limit of two mandates for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is proposed forever, just as the amendment prohibits the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the annulment of federal laws if two-thirds of States oppose it.
As a result, the members of the Committee have been willing to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The cadence slowed down from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed at Congress in 1789.
"Massacre but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him off at Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said he wanted to go back first rather than return to Congress.
During his appearance in the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC channel, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return after the bullet that fractured his skull and penetrated the left side of the brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified his recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords replied " rather well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of an hour of "20/20", broadcast on the eve of the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special show has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the 8th of January shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he was spotted on his hospital bed, shaved head and a wide scar on the forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords was sitting in a wheelchair while the doctors taught him to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word is, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords said another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: is the Representative being seen singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with doctors, said he didn't remember the gun.
According to her husband, she was reading an article on the March 12 rifle when she stopped her and asked for the first time information about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being dealt with vigorously pending trial.
"There were many deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I've been beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you haven't been beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get out of it, get back and get back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie suit stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, the spring fundraiser.
A military high school present in the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, chief of the U.S. Army Staff, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They have been presented as a sort of orphan," wrote the military high-grade in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But that was not respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the military and a passionate American public, but often distant.
Praises are provided to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they declare a few soldiers.
The public is acting increasingly as if it is sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unappreciative or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations on mercy take place in full confidence among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the fight with the Marines, retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were faced with insurgents and traveled to distant territories.
Others would wonder if "a veteran in anger and violence is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who made him spend the interviews asked in a subtle way if he would be able to handle the stress of a job demanding in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you approach the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions," says Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a country that is so unfamiliar with the army and that sees little direct advantage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," says retired lieutenant general David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and the people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
The troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The Army in the face of increasing pressure to deal with rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged rape inaction.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
The first-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant 11 weeks old the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008. She would return to her barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a beer pack.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"C" was an alarm signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught him from behind, thrown down and raped, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still on duty and others, will eagerly await the decision of justice at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether a trial against the former secretary of defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been sexually raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claimed that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says he's taking it to the galloned soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Counsel also states that since February, it has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future prosecutions.
Her strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - thus placing all her eggs in the same basket - she will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, led by American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a decision of the Supreme Court in 1950, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active staff.
"The alleged wrongdoing is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicates the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not, officially, have the right to go to battle, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's military teams play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
As a result of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in conducting this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale's Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Centre prepares a case against the four main military academies to encourage a misogynist atmosphere.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America non-profit foundation prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of " personality disturbances" attributed to victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way of dealing with claims for benefits for those who claim to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mixture of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The March report also examined the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were tried - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her aggressor - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat in front of a judge, at a trial during which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as witnesses of morality to the perpetrator of the crime, which was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was rendered," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions.
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commander, "It wasn't his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was returned under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any advantage.
Will Lyman and the other complainants advance or not, it is a long story, says John Turley, professor of law at the Faculty of Law of the University of Washington.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army lies behind decades because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence as the responsibility.
"The chances are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things only change when the good ones want to fight.
If the trial is not in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will bring together hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who recognized that he had been taken by a deadly madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time prior to the attack on his computer, to discuss with some millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... sign up on Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a report recently published by DEMOS' think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook boasts so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they seek with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have done it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to an investigation. Questions were about their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
DEMOS' study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Thinking groups, medical researchers and polytologists use the site to study all subjects that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to the "I love", publications on the walls and updated statutes.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "data supernova" generates an explosion in the field of research, increasing the number of research works whose name of the site appears in the title of almost 800 per cent over the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's advantage is that it allows you to study people you might not be able to approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Mr. Megan Moreno of Wisconsin University, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits were enormously more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students on this subject.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would be too often about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for the Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Research Institute for Children in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would in another case not be recognized."
Facebook also consistently accesss the information of its users.
The data team studied statistics on the situation in love and on the day of St. Valentine's Day, the participation rate in the mid-term 2010 elections and a national happiness index ( thanks to information only available - the champions of digital freedom have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they have not even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, it is something else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologists at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study that he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As they know, exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going over the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you're saying on Facebook and what you're doing in reality are two totally different things," says Neil Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a block-notes and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social aspect is not in front of a computer."
"Froid et Inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 in Norway this summer, described himself as a combatant "of resistance" during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Temples of Norway," he explains in front of a 500-person courtroom.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I accept it, because you have your mandate of organizations supporting hatred ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, speak to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor on the Norwegian TV channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark costume and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at the journalists and survivors in his eyes by entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some of them.
But this does not reduce the pain and confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred him to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview at the Cinema This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing himself from the engineering and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how this creative spirit understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself to a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an improvement of organizational charts - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "sickness letting them think that a brilliant idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a brilliant idea of an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sat down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a complete video was found in the director's garage.
This video, which is slightly rebounded, is the base of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast at the cinema on Wednesday and Thursday next.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems amazingly enthusiastic here to expose technological philosophies and its commercial strategies.
And incredibly careful.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly ponders his thoughts, in order to provide a specific answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism is resurging, where he seems to be eager to hear Cringely's questions, kicking him to speed him up and move on to more important questions or subjects.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely accurate aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he sees as good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computer science.
It's one thing to read Steve Jobs' posthumous evaluations of career, but there's something gross and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
It has a vision of how things can be and must be.
He explains them and then puts them into action.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned how to run a company:
"For all these years, I have always asked: 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'Oh, just because you have to do them.'
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to provide details of his efforts to simplify Apple accounting.
Perplexed about how the costs were recorded - often started with a "standard cost" evaluated for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to take a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells of the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and to phone for free in long distance.
The device has been written many times in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphory here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, passing a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball in different things a half-dozen times and you shouted in the public phone and it came to you a minute later on the public phone next door," explains Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we ourselves could create something that could control billions of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much about both of them, but we were able to invent a little thing capable of controlling big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night, turning to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the U.S. diplomat, the two accomplices go mad laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love with technology (and release from Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, in the spare parts hunt to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and put him on a string.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. C" was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first ever designed desktop computer."
He was as big as a suitcase, owned a small cathode tube. I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At some point in the interview, Steve Jobs is talking about making new products on a head shot.
At the beginning of his career, as he settles to sell some printed circuit cards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, he should take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later, at Apple, he recalled the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big quarrels... I was screaming over myself, claiming that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that would be incredibly reliable.
On large businesses that go on:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way in which many industrial leaders were going to cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's admit that you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copyr or a better printer, and then after?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these types of people] that end up leading companies and specialized product personnel are set aside from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product from a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have held the entire IT industry.
She could have made ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a brilliant idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, electrons can do, glass, robots, factories, too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by combining them with each other.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso said one day the good artists copy and the great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
It's in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health law opponents while the court meets
On the day that the Supreme Court met in private to consider the question of political discord, whether the opposition to the law of President Obama of Health would be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that would defend the case in the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases concerned a 26-State trial contesting the reform of the ambitious health care passed by Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5h30 is expected in March next, and the outcome will probably be in a position to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be on the rise at the time the court's decision will be made.
The lawyer to be held before the court and will argue about the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as the general solicitor of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The PLLC Bancroft Legal Office of Clement has been one of the two dozen cabinets that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business Companies.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial issue in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There were, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican of the Senate and the stated opponent of the Health Act.
The guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing going against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fund collections of law-related and other organizations although the judge cannot be an intervener, an honored guest, or on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the business's lawyers' offices, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was sufficient to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court abides by the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"Judges drank and ate and collected gala funds with lawyers who have cases in court."
Their presence and participation in the fund-raising of this event demonstrates any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for criticisms that they too easily mix court cases with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a top-profile conservative activist.
In addition, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general solicitor of Obama's administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought at the level of the court of first instance.
His critics put pressure on Kagan to accept the case, saying that she had too much involvement in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing registers a record order of $18 billion for online aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-couloir-line planes, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, an estimated $1 billion market.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order containing 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is a whole case when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 planes reaches the record sum of $18 billion.
Also incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, an increasing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In the published forecasts on Monday, Chicago believes that the airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft with a total value of $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive order of commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-colloirs.
It was the Emirates airline based in Dubai that passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 additional aircraft, which would increase the total order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated on Monday that the company Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts of major fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than $1 billion.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have huge value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them because the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil increases, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The order of Emirates reinforces Boeing's predominance on the market of large-wing aircraft and helps to curb the attempt to implement the Airbus competitor with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aircraft show arrives four months after Airbus' announcement to defer the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which rivals directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus rejects its beginnings to increase its growth as a result of its customers' demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican President manifestly beaten in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo du PRI in the race to the governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her attempt to access the office of Governor of Michoacán in the course of violent elections, and on Monday she said that drug traffickers had favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI, was in the lead of the race to the position of governor of this Western State.
"The crime organized throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officers... they took the polls, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only recently emerged from Calderon, who was at the head of the polls before the day of the election.
Calderon, a candidate of his brother's conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, who currently serves as governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidentials for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former Mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the traffic of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A week before the elections a mayor of the PAN was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally because of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections have air, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages the coming Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to prepare to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growth in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indulgent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent the long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain point but it is not sheltered."
"So if China and India can help, nothing prevents them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan is dangerously high in arrow and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece resigned.
The growing crisis of sovereign debt in Europe gave rise to the fear that the global economy would return to recession, and called on the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag said that the IMF would provide Asian aid, but he also said that bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the United States financial saving fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power to the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade and Industry Minister, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a drop in exports and a slowdown in foreign capital arrivals.
"No one wants the euro zone to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to meet and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where will we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutush Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically difficult to make Europe accept assistance to 1.2 billion Indians, of which at least 800,000 live with 2 dollars a day or less.
"One day, they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and that they go on holiday in the sun and they'll have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many Greek officials well paid in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area was likely to cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
BASD forecasts of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "risks of loss" because of the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "help plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and significant capital leakage.
Strong warnings from the Pentagon on potential defence reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget compressions would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, through civilian rallies.
The Pentagon already has $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more compressions will be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditures.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating to the ministry," said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from what is called kidnapping would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"An equally important reduction, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and our inexhaustible construction projects - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm the other modernization efforts," writes Panetta to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on pay-free leave in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would weaken the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would possibly affect the fighting troops, continue Panetta.
"Although the financing in wartime of the accounts of contingencies abroad is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be adversely affected by serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contracts supporting the war."
"The staff managing wages would be reduced, leading to delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defence would have led to a rapid decline in the United States as an undisputed world leader in military power."
"We are quite opposed to this draconian action," said senators in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon in the publication of Panetta's letter.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to occur."
That the letter of Panetta and recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about the possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the highest position of the Pentagon in the years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a soldier with a shell but not a core.
"It's a ship without a sailor."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a hunting plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites the assault."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "produce significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could go to the coupet, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the F35 Fighter Joint Strike, a new scheduled bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new land vehicle, which would replace the military and marine Humvee.
Putting an end to F35's development and testing could generate $80 billion over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates the extent to which deception and lies are omnipresent in everyday life.
The Republican candidate to the presidency, Herman Cain, is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women, each on the other accusing the other of lying.
The Penn State administrators were accused of betting for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach had sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The New York Congress member and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, went on to be an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate for President John Edwards was accused of violations of campaign funding related to the coverage of an extra-husband link.
And then, none of those who have experienced the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating on school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test responses to students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have carried out an in-depth research of such projects, including in psychology and physiology.
One of the research results is that the oldest myths on the lie have been demystified.
The liars look into your eyes.
They don't swallow, they're praying or they don't always get upset.
Do not conclude that liars are hard to detect and hard to expose.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation and time of answer.
I have spent many years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are skilled at reading others, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people less often lie to their partners than unwed people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, the others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "setting the benchmark data."
This helps to provide a benchmark to measure subsequent changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, laughter, vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally removes his feet permanently so as not to launch unfair accusations when you see him kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and nonverbal deceptive behaviour.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceivers can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards a exit, change their posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated breath of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions are passed.
Questionors often falsely indicate that the interview was just finished to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, watch out for the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson broke up using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceivers can also use a distanced language: "I haven't had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a completely difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember good... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimization by crawlers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after the U.S. threat of late approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - sparking the anger of the trade unions while calming the environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says that it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada stated on Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Chapter of Nebraska.
Trans Canada's officer, Alex Perbax, says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval from an pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the dunes of Nebraska and Ogallala aquifer, vast sources of groundwater.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have pushed any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials denied the policy involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries of Texas.
In order to do so, it would be necessary to cross six States.
He is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have put on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to this plan insist that a law to force the remoteness of the Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current Department of State's environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General had ordered a separate investigation into the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist committed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hilary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice from its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit in fear
A family in New York claims that the Diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched in a riot of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrorized their little girl to the point of she poured out her fear.
The drama of the singer "Lady Marmalade" scared little Geneviève Monk 18 months old, so much so that she suffered "from personality changes, sleep disorders" and "great fear of strangers," said her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was last November 10th, while stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to leave on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the hall of their boulevard Riverside building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came after me and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said, "Yes," and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle angryly warned the pregnant woman.
"She told me of an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "what you say or think I don't care."
She became angry and began using oaths - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling from the bottle's water.
She said that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who always kept Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her entourage that led her to a car waiting for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so loud that she threw herself up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but no response was received.
Lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls for comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially towards a mother-in-law teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate Adversity has curbed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year to be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-calling for change, which has generated great expectations for the progress of the economy, but given the climate aversion of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The lower temperatures in February, apart from the loss of billion for the agricultural sector, have limited the opportunities of the State economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical decrease of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of ice cream allocations from the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there have been damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent have suffered partial damage, the main dead crops have been vegetables, corn and chic peas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate of the State during the first three quarters of the year, an accelerated increase was observed, as from January to March 55 thousand 053 signals were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, the rate in the second quarter became 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand unemployed, an increase compared to the first six months of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS School of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by public policy actions.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources approved by Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an illegal way, it is not easy for them to work to win, invest and use them in something," he says.
Migration detained
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the State to go to work abroad, in the United States was restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people remain here and asking for sources of work, which makes unemployment rising," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works without contributing as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for dissociation for the state is low wages, the entity has lower pay in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much less than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED Contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment in 2011, the highest reduction in the Foreign Direct investment over the past 10 years was recorded, according to the Economic Secretariat from January to June, the State FDI reached $630 thousand 697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5 million 143 thousand 312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Government of the State Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, mainly registered by the tertiary sector companies.
The debt
In view of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested the approval of a 3-billion-weight credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities in July, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the state congress was 2,600-billion-weight and until November no profit was observed in debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For employers, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has been really very poor, it is necessary to work intensively to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, it has been necessary to align the effort of all and above all the good already synchronized walk of this new government team, hopefully the next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the ice cream of the beginning of the year have retained the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced from several events, including ice cream, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level and flow in trials, products and services and, therefore, at the end of the year we hold very close below the expectations that we had," he says.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriahte, President of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that it is intended to channel the State into productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms, we have observed that we have worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important to deduce all the potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he says.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that could better guide the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in various areas, in terms of economic development, there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, which I can say is that much work has been done and that the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to be done," he said.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marijuana
One resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fines for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the small convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of marihuana possession for sale.
In accordance with the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on June 7, 2010 during a surveillance operation on the street of Cipriano Valdez, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker moved in a pick-up truck, white, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle trunk and on the copilot's place a small back bag where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Legal Consequences Enforcement Centre of the Crimes.
Debt to contributions to the works
Social publications reflected in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants may not be finished where there are serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes have progressed so far, they are in a risk situation, as the Government of the State has failed to fulfil its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He pointed out that the total investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, from which the State must provide 25 per cent and until now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is a possibility of delay in their completion.
"They must make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end they have given us nothing, even though since July they had to give us a part," he says, "and we, to not record delays, started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration, the Municipality had to apply for a provision to cover the 7 million that the government had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and programs continue to operate and this year, in order to have access to these programmes, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management to ensure that the relevant percentages arrived as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end, they have not given us anything."
The Court valid "the analogue cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has dismissed the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue cutup" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes required to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutional or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft award, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the decree's declaration as a non-constitutional, because radio and television regulations are a statutory award to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and to admit the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of Ministers also resolved to issue the complaint made by the House of Deputies, without discussing the project of which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures to prepare for the public administration to do so.
"I also consider that if it is done, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has for the constitutional mandate of the government.
Substituting analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years and this results in better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To adjourn the change, he supported it, would be to adjourn the benefits of digitisation which implies a decision of public interest which not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of a whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompasses a group of powers which the Constitution grants to the Faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries from around the world have already finished the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the highly specialized technical organs.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of Congress in one form, as it ensures in the administrative sphere that the laws issued by the Legislative are respected, he is sworn.
An analysis of the possibility of a vote in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 minutes.
The possibility of voting vote is a reality in the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Pre-Trial Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and the second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either its Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the Congress of the State has approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral process to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has omitted his publication within the time limits provided for in the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same November 9th, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms, because he does not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote per vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal stated that with the approval of the relevant guidelines by the IEM General Council it will be possible to make the partial and total counts of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of polling and the record of the ballot is not in the chair's case; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all polls may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the poll is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition by the representative of the party and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total vote shall also be held if, at the end of the joint count, the difference between the alleged winner and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate has gone out second, in which case the electoral packages that were subject to the partial vote shall be excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PRSP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without accounting for the 129 votes of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
Its ashes will be spread in the Zapalinamé sierra, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a mass of rest.
According to his family, the Lieutenant Colonel's last wish was that his ashes be spread in the Zapalinamé sierra.
After receiving the tributes to others who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the guard chapel of the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was paid tribute to the Institute of Technology of Saltillo organized by his former technological baccalaureate colleagues and the American football team that was part of Felipe Bacio when he was preparing for the bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and his ashes spread in the Zapalinamé saw, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considered that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and he cared for his family a lot".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he was even suffering from a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving an aircraft.
I'm the last goodbye.
With honours it was said to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, tribute to Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Institute of Technology of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself in both studies and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, next to the government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of this service.
The remains of the driver Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the splanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found killed at fires fired in different parts of the body and with the grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of Cadereyta road in Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this place observed that in the property, whose closure has beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, at approximately three metres, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At a distance meter there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were spread over the belly.
According to data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, as no in situ was found.
In the close of the property there were legends directed by one criminal group organized towards the other, besides some bullet holes in the property and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated primarily in the municipality of Caderyta and who were considered to have relations with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in the first instance on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros eight persons were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was able to be saved.

By arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 2:00 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on board the economic disaster
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on board the economic disaster and put the whole of Eurozone at risk.
A press release from the Presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a majority office by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive assumes his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the outcome of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly state that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The frame is now well-tagged, he adds.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normally, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels that are impossible to support.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard austerity package required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to move forward, the instability of markets to place the yield of Italian BTP obligations at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronage Confindustria, said to the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to make this emergency situation a reality.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the majority technocrat government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano on Sunday, which enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief review at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now come to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would give it only time to implement reforms before the elections were made.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that it should only be formed by specialists, an index of objections to a financial pressure process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is greater than that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 convened participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 hired by the two countries for today's Amical, at 15:05 a.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While national and European champions, the number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide register of Class A interselection games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England, keep an intense activity in national league and coup championships and in European Cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Football Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have limited international experience in an area, such as the Concaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goalkeeper Ikker Casillas, who on previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) has equalled the record of the former goal guard Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas today will play against the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, a cerebral fly from Barcelona, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the week before UEFA next to the other hundreds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the avant-centre of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The centenary loan is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the editor Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five were over the 30 games: Kelor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
Those with less than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar only has one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still not starting.
The historic editor of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz recorded the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will also become a dream to happen in this country.
The bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its celebration tour of two decades of work and on Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
That day will appear on the National Stadium, from 19:30 a.m., next to the Los Angeles Group The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcript of which is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I spent only once in Costa Rica; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity the days before.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we're sorry that so long it had to go through to this concert.
Some people already say that their concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the biggest shows we have offered during the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We offered two giant shows to Sao Paolo, and we hope that this set us up for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that is how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
By looking at the tour, you have great shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never worked there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that for?
I think it's partly because we have nine disks and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone loves different songs, so it's very difficult to choose which songs to play every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have not interpreted for a long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes also more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock band, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is very moving.
We love and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't work out better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunt?
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of major groups.
We are very close to the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and it is an honour to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we attended a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we are lucky to be friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of this sound of Seattle that emerged.
It is also very strange that a group like yours will remain united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
First of all, I think we are all fortunate to be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned with others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and that could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what brought it to us, without putting into mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and it was great at first.
We've been a group for almost three years and we haven't published a record before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration about the fact that she lasted so little and most importantly is the fact that we are still very close to Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas national group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and for that you chose him for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and this was the group we loved the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer on-line and it must be very distracting.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbeter's words live for?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
It's him who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
Somehow...
Among the first ones I remember was Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to maintain the grunt despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time and, if that is relevant now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening and groups like Mudhoney now make the best music than ever.
At first, its music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the result of this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and those songs, they probably represent that for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even so we can make music obscure.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during her Government (1990-2000) suffers from various diseases, including a cancer of the language for which she was operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, stated for television channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasmic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been performed four times as a cancer of the tongue, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as a severe erosion gastritis, a pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and circulation problems in the feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of a squadron of annihilation of the army that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political links
An official court, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and employers, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in Guadalajara city will be "proprietary for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French agent Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group of emerging and more developed countries in the world since November, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to push the implementation of tax exchange agreements out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), composed of countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004, a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The lead moistachu passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, untiringly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the bad Bowser's claws, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support", because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations to existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a quick and fluid part.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the least skilled users.
Once overcrowded, the most expert will be able to make a "second round" at play levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, which was no longer happening since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo glances at the saga's followers and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the lead moustachu must travel through mining platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even if I play I find new features in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom welcomes the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the money laundering of US$70 million.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called for Portillo to judge it.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term of office "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had taught all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did involves an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former representative of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for the diversion of Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial prior to extradition, but the Public Department appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 youth at risk
The entity was born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The assessment of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
In addition to this, the long hundred jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make the record in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping untrained, unemployed people with problems of drug abuse or marginalization.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of officials from entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, during the electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
On the side of the President of the Regional Catalan Government (Generalitat), Arthur Mas and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal and the former Deputy Mayor of the Mayor and current Eco-Socialist City Councillor Richard Goma.
Also attended in the large room of Fabra i Coats is the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time, and the present one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it performs," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 apartments of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived ended.
Twelve people left yesterday at 12 noon voluntarily the building they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-fests that were desperate for neighbors, in judicial order and without need of police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From this day on, there will be access control," said the administrator.
Squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were housed - took away the electrical installation and part of that of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially alcohol drinks.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained for Europe Press that as soon as the occupation of the building his business dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the disco they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation facility had to respond to neighbouring complaints about the noise, while, according to this, the disturbances were not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants at the parties there, who were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbours of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the trouble was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it's been nine months since this "forgive him" rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the common and civic problems that it caused the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there had been flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "it must end with impunity and be implacable against antisocial behaviour generated in the property."
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of convening beyond the controversy about fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
By the mid-1980s, in full support of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed promotional posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that doesn't stretch on the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (mer).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is in the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with straps in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door goes back to the park idea, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared all by itself: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to reflection on the city, is a theme of conversation by all architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme, of which two members of this former caste speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions that coincide with three architects from Barcelona, academic professors, who presented themselves there.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Roldán, after approaching the littoral front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of the pasty green houses has not been completed.
"It must start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title "ports of Collserola" contains a "legislative trap": it is not to think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualify the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
Dangers that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and which had been in the Forum area "his song of swan".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step", i.e., its overrun.
"It is necessary to think of new urban planning instruments, as the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GPM)) can lead to real disasters."
With a closer focus on the question, Modol feels that, by simplifying, the verse of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "does not have to be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the mayor offers to her corporation to intervene in this project "given the first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doute" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success", he says) that we have to create: "We architects, we should be only an instrument".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this play is complex, because the bases of the competition lack an overall vision of Collserola: "The 16 cross-sectional competitions have been convened - he says - in the direction of the mountains-mer, but there is no longitudinal reading that goes and understands the area as a whole".
At least in this case, he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project for one of the doors to collide with the program and define with that of the architect of the neighbouring door.
In her opinion, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately exceeds that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a gentle transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red's legal foundation granted forgiveness to the Mayor's brother of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the legal power of the Casino Red gives him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a blackmail trial against the Mayor of Monterrey's brother.
After the attack by Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic fee so that the mayor of Monterrey would allow the illegal operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Parquet opened a criminal trial against the Mayor's brother, PANist, and on 2 September the Parquet was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Department Agent 3 of Patrimonial Offences, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was given a second order of detention after the Public Prosecutor's Office had destroyed the corruption and organized crime crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal centre allegedly for having made the Casino Red owners sing with one and a half million pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, an order of capture was issued by the Clerk of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yanez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as that relating to the impeachment of 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; so he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Officer, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who was the one who granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under the 197/2011 file, legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claim may be filed concerning the trial brought against him; no damages and no punishment shall be sought from him.
After the hearing of the founding of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to San Nicolás de los Garza prison to inform Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate freedom which the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome reports details of the air accident in which he lost his life the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven others
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results highlighted the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven persons lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter crashed directly against the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to take off the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions were adequate for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements to carry the staff.
In addition, he said that the investigations carried out in the impact area did not report the appearance of soil parts.
"In one research, it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the Secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may last a few months, it may even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Aid Services, assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff Staff was operating at the speed of cruising and it happened on a moving ground.
"This information supports the assumption of normal operation cruising at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, the TBS licensee, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual Flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft moved towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico, there were layers of low-level nebulosity.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to conditions of nebulosity the crew has sought a lower and more visibility area to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remaining parts of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available to date allows the assumption that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral path.
The aircraft remains dispersal model allows the aircraft to assume that the helicopter has encountered against the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No trace of fire or explosion was detected:
There is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contact with the ground.
During the field work, the aircraft parts were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, with a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
Photographs show the sequence in which he was possibly disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a larger area than the surrounding area, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supported the presumption that the impact took place under structural integrity conditions.
MSS ad protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by NPI specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Assurance (IMSS) announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of obesity of children and adolescents' that will allow the markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital des Specialités of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been trained.
This team is supported by third-cycle specialists and students of the National Institute of Public Health (NPI) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvesav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate in the population with or without the right to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valle de México, where evidence is provided to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the sports unit Cuauhtémoc (State of Mexico West) and that, as of October 8, the activity takes place in the sports unit of Nezahualcoyolt (State of Mexico East).
After achieving the objective of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Independence Unit (south of Federal District) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (north of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that is to know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
As will be celebrated on 14 November on World Diabetes Day, he noted that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and history of family legacy of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
It has explained that Saturdays will be applied to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of the size), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (the aim is to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there was an increase in boys of 77 per cent in obesity and 47 per cent in girls of overweight; there was also a dramatic increase in overweights," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the others by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent indo-American inheritance, 30 per cent in Europe and five per cent in Africa, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, obesity genetics translates into the inability to burn the excess of energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full evaluation of children, which enables them to detect if they present a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored plus (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and doctors send it in writing to parents, to whom each is explained the measures and changes in the lifestyle they have to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - meat pasta to corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cassia
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemicals School, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mix with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair approximately 200 thousand rainfalls each rainy season in the Métropolitan Area of Valle de México, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemie (FQ) of UNAM, who ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous pavement is adequate, the casses could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory responsible for it develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the performance, and consequently, the formation of casses.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltene, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give to the paveda its viscoelastic behavior characteristic.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents a almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes cassant, adds it.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City in most of them were covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the small stones that forms the bed, it indicates, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles go through with efforts, it allows the forces to propagate very well into the pavement.
If the asphalt had changed, the asphalt would propagate better, the chemical engineer would.
On the asphalt layer, he says, one last layer called rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide adherence to the street.
As the part of the deck that receives and distributes the efforts, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made of should be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, as they significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil is wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to do, which boils all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes the cassis.
In the process of forming a cassia, he says, the first one that breaks is the rolling film and only later the asphalt layer is affected, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that needs to be treated at the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassia and therefore the thickness of each layer of the deck must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent training of cassia.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow for easy repair of casses and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Colombia miss?
Analysis of factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna to fail to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her title number 14 as a princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win Miss Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle with the fact that she was on the winner's podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico was mounted with the crown and the scepter, the top department already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Visa Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took away Miss Colombia's crown.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to appoint First Princess is the fact that she did not believe with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez, Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the response of the Valle candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a fairly deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Câtement", it's a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Blood Abhor."
This response was not primarily due to the term "culturalize" and secondly not to explain in concrete terms how each book quoted had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, read, please, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the assumptions made is that Valle was destroyed by favourism.
A Bogota journalist suggested that being the preferred, the ovated and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (the challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote of the public for the best craftsmanship suit, and Queen Mother), "he woke up the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage."
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at the Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the crown.
Although she had felt sure of herself at both sides, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "Como en cassa" program (Comme at home), of the RCN Canal said that Melina was designated princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another assumption is that Valle has failed to convince the jury of its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by its defects in its back and the fibrosis that was observed in its abdomen, but this is contradictory, because the jury specifically elected it as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the body healthier, good food and responsible physical work.
The Queens' Preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognized that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but his fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in fact had not been too well known to me, left him points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, considers that the error of Valle's candidate was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she's lost because of this."
For this prize, which the National Competition of Beauty gives up for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came up a cruel prediction that took place last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo gave Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A dictator of Cali went to history like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these staff members is crucial.
On November 4th, a CTI dactyloscopicist from Cali went to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopicists working at the local ITC offices, this week was the "availability" tour of Eliasar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Choco, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after following proper courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano we had warned Eliasar to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much less.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galton magnifying glass, ink, a picker and a lantern, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.
His eye did not wrong him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible who confirmed to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the chief of the Farcs.
Looking for the print
For a journalist of Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliasar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people didn't know about our work.
Dactylloscopy is an accurate science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from identifying the dead bodies, the dactyloscopicists support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders have false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and searches in the database.
The investigator said that in a case of flight he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of all the hand and identify to the offender who had participated in different flights," he recalls.
Printers may also exclude or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be a suspect of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincidentally.
Even if it doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it's the crime scene.
One ITC dactyloscopicist explained that the "digital fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a picker or band is used to pick them up.
Subsequently, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declinant database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the expert from the ITC.
He explained that everything is not how we show in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not of gold, everything you touch doesn't necessarily become a print.
It can, however, be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignants" defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people have joined the evacuation order and have moved to a nearby park.
The responsibilities of the Occupe Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Pomme.
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access by means of a judicial order that allows the 'indignants' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to evacuation by occupying a more northern park in the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in place, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the spokespersons of the "Occupe Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the 'indecents' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignites' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church parish.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray could not confirm the actual number, ensuring that he saw some journalists who had also been through the handcuffs.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support of members of the movement and has tried to intervene in favour of them before the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property enclosure - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled by this Tuesday during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
A few internally displaced demonstrators so far carried and distributed copies of this order and even delivered it to the agents who monitored the place, which caused 'small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials had hit the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupe Wall Street or applying 'laws issued after the commencement of the occupation or from prohibiting demonstrators from entering the park again with tents or other properties they used earlier'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and demonstrators, but he warned that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councilman personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided on account of the fact that the demonstrators 'violated the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm other people", because "some stores had been threatened" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation this morning at dawn has been repulsive and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The officials of "Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not think of organizing "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television program of Noel
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", married rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Canadian TV Noel.
CTV's private television channel today announced that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed like the Virgin Mary by supporting in a creche a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently introduced a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" appeared as Joseph.
Next to Anderson and Peters, the CTV's special Noel program also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who, at the end of March, married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called America's "pute" Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan was born after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the country's worst disaster in Japan since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September have been used to turn the page permanently: GDP has reached 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at annual rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the greatest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of the capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real incentive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, use the shortcomings for zero-croit.
Japan has mainly woken up by the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable resulted in 1%, driven by increased expenditures on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigmatise of the yen
Tokyo went back to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugees" elected by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the United States forecasts, a privilege that weighs as a result of the export company's accounts.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, accounted for their low performance between July and September for the contribution of yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of yen, must be monitored," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are halted.
Because it dropped four decimal points to 100,4 points, compared to 100,8 points in output.
Eurozone has even been below the average, which is at level 100, not lowering eight decimal points to 99.13 points.
Athens again fuels doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservative will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to interfere in the labyrinth that leads to the release of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is imposed by Brussels' demands that a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday, indicated that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days set in his designation may be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, made sure that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the planned date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," said Papadimos when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate which will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not raise doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the organizations that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently requires, and made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the whole Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not release the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the leading Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, although there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain's "préponder" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose " essence" lies in the fact that it is an "tool for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the assurance that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very much, in the one that aims to reduce half the volume of people who live with incomes under a dollar per day, to which the "soil of poverty" is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and takes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "enhanced the creation of new capacities and the best opportunities for the poorest and especially women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We "have achieved a lot of goals" and "we face a lot of challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families have come from the poverty line in which they now live.
Impulsion in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering manner" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she had known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous development," explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project gave her yesterday the qualification of "the head of the family" gathered in Valladolid from the "bank of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía finished her speech by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and in seeking solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, has warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits assume "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" developed country governments must work under criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "of trust" to people "exclusive to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, a chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for the programme but was imposed in the fall, in particular to satisfy the militants who judge the government's policy too laxistic towards the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, following their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The idea-master of the Chancellor - and of the motion - lies in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "time has come from a breakthrough in Europe."
This could lead to amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
This is in any case one of the proposals for the motion adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Sept will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile there and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also so.
But the yellow is laid.
Similarly, delegates rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country to the Director of the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which was obviously re-enhancing Germany's weight.
In order to ease the climate within its party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has also not sought to win her congress on the backs of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty soon to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the cross.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud in disease arrests represent?
After allowances, the UMP and the government are launching the offensive on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - repeated since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and attendance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts with a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less annoyance of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on disease arrests.
First of all, for budgetary savings: the government is planning to impose a fourth day of deficiency on private employees before a stopover is taken.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, a person who becomes ill would lose four days' wages, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that is likely to cause anger, but which would yield 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another, more symbolic measure: to impose on civil servants a day of non-compensation in the event of a cessation of work (they have so far no shortage time, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also revives the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuses related to work arrests.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will repay," Xavier Bertrand warned the RTL micro on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at work.
This has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are not sicker than they are in Europe.
Let us first focus on national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NCAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health spending in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% related to sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, on average, the French had 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the Career Management Site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they did not take any sick days.
Another study, this time of the Sickness Insurance , indicates that in 2010, 37% of the disease cessations were of less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer inclined to stop work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in disease arrests is very low in the face of black work.
With regard to fraud, it is limited in scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on disease arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long" or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% "inadapted or unjustified" cases of 1.2 million, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unjustified" cases, therefore, out of several million employees who have had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little, for example, the one of black work.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June, the latter would represent EUR 9-15 billion of tax revenue per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to correct its economy.
On Monday, November 14, the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, in front of Parliament, said that the hundred days given to his government of union would not be sufficient to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader on the right, supported the measures already approved on Monday to try to escape the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage in an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and of combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of 8 billion euro required without written guarantee of all the parties they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says an expert committee.
Canadians live in the denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to enable assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada has ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, they report to us experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die at the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring at the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report arrive at conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already said they do not want to change anything to the Criminal Code on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted by non-compliant or non-consent persons.
On the contrary, it stated yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, there would be more cases of these spillovers precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie says.
Canadians Supporting Euthanasia
Let us recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow end-of-life people to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the life of the elderly or disabled is less valuable.
As for persons who have committed assisted suicide, the respondents felt 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect a life-end refusal without fear of criminal prosecution.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some health law experts have already made reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's report of experts.
But Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has described as "extreme" the position of the report's signatory experts, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ills.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help to kill himself," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to place the individual's autonomy over all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society," he says, "there are balls and constraints."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifesta".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly challenging the data in the report on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Ladies denounces a plot
Syria is increasingly isolated
partisans of Bachar al-Assad showed yesterday to the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on Bachar al-Assad Syria, which, with Russia's support, resists them and denounces a "complement" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand for President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdallah II was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "cut off power" in Syria where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bachar had the heart of his country's interest, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, deplored the failure of Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year to the Syrian regime.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will go," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey adopts an increasingly harsh line.
The United States welcomed "enhancing the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey adopt a growing tone" in the face of repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces perished in the Deraa region, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians perished "from shooting and piloting to heavy machine guns at Jobar" in Homs City, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Moualem nevertheless felt that the country was "leading towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he believed was "a dangerous step".
Syria will not "flash," he added, ensuring that "the evil plots against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers in the country.
French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also welcomed the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believed is confined to the paranoia.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in connection with the protest and release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergueï Lavrov yesterday judged the Arab League's decision "uncorrect" while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while maintaining its support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Amount demand for time in Italian markets and sacrifices
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a little time in the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the lost credibility in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the unions and the patronage.
It should set up a relatively small office consisting of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the interviews, after meeting with the President of the designated Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will be concluded with Mr. Monti's submission of a small list, probably one dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets yesterday, demanding time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certainly the markets will be patient and will understand".
His appointment by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern had been raised, in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated prime minister should be a team with technocrats in particular, even though he stressed that he would like to include "political".
The new government is due to last until 2013, the next legislative date, he said.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti has committed, once he has taken office, to work in the emergency and to the goal of Italy becoming a "prominent" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, called for new measures to be taken.
The Italian patron saint Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, who is renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of the serious" and another "Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great stranger will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place EUR 200 billion in state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-use detonator, said on Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week on its "serious concerns" regarding a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Ural, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamond by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diaminants" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would have subsequently cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before his return to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA refers to "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during the core of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Crimes and anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased from nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence has declined slightly or little, according to the FBI statistics made public on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 to 49%, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and an overall increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased significantly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes increase again," the organization of human rights rights First emphasized, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he added, believing that this could result in an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual membership.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site introduced on Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to enable its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes their service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allows you to follow more easily, live the activity of other "Twittos", netizens who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows them to know if they are following messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast across the network on Monday, told the AFP the Twitter spokesperson, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its instinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to broadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the initiates happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the major public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were debating "tweets" based on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
Inclusion of a budgetary "gold rule" in the constitution
The Government of Great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary "gold rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus to avoid any deterioration by Austria's rating agencies (Triple A).
It is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision following a Council of Ministers, while Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced only from one crani, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest more each year," said Vice-Chancellier and Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria therefore responded to a request from the euro area member countries in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the federal government's structural deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional States and the municipalities will have to submit budgets to balance.
The objective is to move public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty to 2020/21.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens a new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the exchange market if the yen were to continue to mount.
"We will intervene as we did the last time if we find excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, explained Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of force since 1945 in front of the green ticket.
But the yen has been regularly rebounded since, made up of purchases by investors who regard it as a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was dropped on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro fell under the symbol bar of the 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar quoted around 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
This boom in the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago because it has earned the cost of Made in Japan and has reduced the value of foreign income by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan's struggle to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), said Mr. Noda who feared that this re-enjoyment of the yen would not kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The third world economic power has renewed with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in one year, thanks to a rebound in the exports and consumption of disaster-leading households.
But the Prime Minister found that the yen price did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for his part called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of his monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", suggesting that no additional monetary relief was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Emissions Institute increased by €5,000 billion (€47 billion) its purchases of Treasury bills to €55,000 billion (€519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts allocated to the purchases of various financial securities to inundate the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The rates climb, the scholarships flange
The risk of contagion in the debt crisis always undermines European indices.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to rise.
Always worrying about the stability of the euro area, the European Scholarships are sinking a little further into negative territory, this Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10h, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% at 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new strains on the yields of eurozone borrowings in difficulty, global equity markets continue to make some of their recent gains ".
" Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters Agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed by 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed market concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have proof that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, managing funds from Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved at its lowest level for one and a half months.
Around 10h, the European currency is worth $1,3570, reflecting 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she withdrew after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion, including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds to 10 years is 6.85%, that of Spanish securities with the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time in the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the " main task " of his government.
Spain is on the market line, while legislative elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The difference in rate (" spread ") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new higher historical level.
Waiting for eurozone growth figures
On the statistics side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, brought by household consumption.
However, the Insee has revised the number of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
And it's really the fourth person who worries the most about economists.
Germany, for its part, grew by 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11h, while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must take it to the dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under emotional strain, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear power.
The debate will only be successful if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their views on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate deregulation, a missing subject of environmental debate.
The accident in Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which submits itself to the need to be able to find a source of replacement capable of replacing itself, nor with Switzerland, which just intends to build only last-generation power stations.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote only them, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by resuming the construction of a power station interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality runs counter to the speech.
The choice of Berlin will lead to the increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependency aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions resulting from the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, all these negative effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be amended.
The European Champion of the Wind, whose 30% derives from its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittentness of the wind; thus, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average respectively.
On the other hand, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a key to the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
Thus, any significant reduction on the part of nuclear would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would shed light on the good statements on the reindustrialization of our country and on the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French refuse to pay, even if they do not show opposition in principle to this energy, polls show it.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has built an industrial industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and makes them very creative for non-relocalizable jobs.
If France had just decided to come out of nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a skin of sorrow.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to run sixty years while its manufacturer's decline would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity, no more than there is a diabolical one.
The development by Areva of low-emitting, nuclear and renewable CO2 solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a Safety Authority that exercises intransigating and transparent control over existing plants as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same security obsession.
In a half century, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failings caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two unprecedented natural disasters that have killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wishing to build a power station, the cessation of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to seize leadership in the undisturbed development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy stock for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate a debate that is also decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the recruitment of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the statistics policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "countries of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
There is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right on this subject.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot host all the world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, fear of invasion of the national territory by Polish lead hordes was shared on the left as well as on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that immigrants will receive.
In his program, François Hollande can boast banality, indicating that co-development will solve our "migrant problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electoral pay, but it is economically very expensive.
As noted by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration undermines growth and reduces employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace national workers, particularly low-skilled workers, with lower pressures on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly in job shortages sectors.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the job supply.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country with a shortage of anaesthetics, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows results in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
This does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of immigrants naturalized among American Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, in Germany, an immigrant who is 30 years of age will make a net contribution (less-expenditure receipts) of EUR 150000 to the average public budgets on the whole of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for the missing growth points "with his teeth".
The teeth in question, using to deter immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think of European democracy
Democracy is a very valuable thing; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, in order to have invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has experienced the tragedies of the Great War over the twentieth century, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be sufficient for democracy to finally succeed its enemies, to vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner that is.
We know, from Napoleon's "The Little One", that it was a simple thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, the Lights, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first of all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum had in this regard the value of double revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved away, and that for many of them Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized in terms of needs and in a dispersed order.
A white seing to the European absolute monarch or a jump to feet attached in the void of the nationalist reply: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to cutters, but we want a common exercise, of full law, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there can be no longer where to stop the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that goes to the dictatorships of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the pilotage of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The outbreak of crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, except of course lead to disaster.
After fighting this proposal from Socialists and Jacques Delors for a long time, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Maybe.
But thinking of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" the Republicans.
The Revolution in Interests could not suffice.
This lesson is still valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe on an economic level.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
The "no contact" smart cards are generalized
The world salon of the puce map opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% of world sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or to settle your purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million uncontacted cards should be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to further advance in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent nearly 10% of the overall market for smart card (6,925 million cards).
Long past the Asia-Pacific region, Europe wins land for the free of contact payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double caps.
Carrefour issued this year 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French establishments have committed themselves to systematically broadcast to their customers of bank cards equipped for contact without contact," says Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for making transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally know a real growth next year."
"Our tables on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday, to prepare the market for an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Alger has now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which the two organizations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without more precision.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French people in Niger last January would have updated the gateways.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by the close of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delors were to be killed the next day along with several of their fans during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the debris of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls directs to several speakers based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, a cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who tells himself close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but you may have to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had been increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and speeches or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosive devices increasingly complex and with the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account Boko Haram's problems.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of illustrious little interest.
Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haousssa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It politicizes and requires strict respect of the sharia while its militants engage in the fight against the central government impede.
First, they target churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrest alive, is killed in prison.
Then the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs in the north.
At Christmas last, she claimed an attack that caused 80 deaths in Jos, then another one in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took it to the police secure GQ during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia by going through Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned Boko Haram and said he was ready to share all the information.
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplism and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying the tonitruous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unsupported - were.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them "to manipulate their currency", a theme that brings to an America overwhelmed by the migration of the entire belt of its industry to Asia.
So much worse if it should involve the outbreak of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to Obama China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that "flatts" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is stagnant in the depths of the polls, remains unheard of.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he's fanfarenated."
"If Obama is reelected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows a embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he was calling against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently unaware of China's possession of the military weapon since 1964!
Governor Texan Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the US army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy foreign policy burden.
The current president's opponents say that Reagan also had simple ideas and he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to put water in his wine in counter-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the early departure of Iraq's "boys", on its tergiversities in Libya, thereby attaching to it a low label.
But the attack is not so easy.
Rather, the population sees the national security balance sheet of Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been suspicious of military interventions that lead to the eviction.
And, arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
North Stream, Russia's new gas port in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia by crossing the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with bursts.
More than 500 guests, of whom four heads of state and government participated, on Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects Russia directly under the sea to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Filon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first 1,224 km tube connecting the region of St. Petersburg to the Land of Mecklembourg-Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we already mention the possibility of building a third on the same course.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction site has air of victory.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will enable gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossings by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to the West European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supply.
But it is at the price of a weakening of Europe of energy, as the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has barely achieved its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are declining.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," confirmed François Filon, opening this gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major gas contracts are both political and economic.
This explains the broad smiles displayed by the Gazprom leaders, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical operation.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-gained steel to protect it against ships' anchors.
It rests on the seabed at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, by caution," said Jens Müller, spokesman of North Stream.
There was also a need to multiply the measures to protect wildlife and flora.
The tube is a long metal serpent, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts all its length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A monitoring platform was planned off Sweden, but project managers resigned from it while the Swedish were reluctant to see a Russian state company established permanently off their shores.
"In case of damage, we stop passing the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline is thus leaked into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who planned the welds to escape every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by a submarine robot, trained by a ship, for external observation, and by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
Of the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide by one meter diameter, and is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, he provides accurate information on the possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to run fifty years without having to suffer less repair.
Gas circulation is simply driven by pressure.
It is 200 bars in the beginning, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, holding 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this renewable 20-year company the total gas transport capacity.
" Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of actually transported gas," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be up to EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their fees, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters tall, form the gas exit door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, this terminal has received a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand name card.
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to re-enjoy the taste of writing.
It has a perfume of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white colour, as old as by time.
Yet, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo company, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a book of design notes but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The carnet is inspired by an old production technique, the soft skin (skin skin) which means a varnished cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
" Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, up to the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has become responsible for the brand at Mode.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first few years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a dress portrait of the buyer, as the notebook of notes seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginning, accounts for almost 100 today and has since 2008 two offices; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from Fnac to the small downtown shops and has managed to impose her identity.
"We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies Moleskine's development: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own books.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and its cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer covers... The brand has a wide range of media.
A success that made a lot of envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy set up in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is even greater than average: 19%, compared with 9% for the whole population.
Discouragement?
"No, Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the Association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled. "
" The progress made over the past 15 years has been considerable " .
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"It remains, however, enormously to be done."
It must be said that for disabled people, the obstacles remain much before they can get to employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the bac and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that specifically complicate the return to employment, and which "are the core of the problem," said Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
This is for objective brakes.
There remains the non-dict, the mindsets that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur for the City indicated that the interviewed managers had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, the private companies of more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% disabled workers, as set out in a law of... 1987.
The last known figures from 2008 show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc. "
" But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of the 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of the companies from 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "How happy I am"
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday evening (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match brought them.
We won't even write that there was conniving between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the platform of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made the peace well.
Five months after the mood gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian picker only has praise to do about him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and his being Belgian."
"I want to go ahead," says Lillois.
As for the contrast between his club and selection benefits, "it's a whole, it's justified."
"In Lille, I'm there all year long, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Made against Romania on Friday evening in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "briller".
Not to mention, however, the notion of "luisir".
The Blues have encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
It is therefore important to strengthen further the "particulier" character of this meeting.
Especially in front of him, "there's Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We crossed all the time."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens has for his part referred to the "goalty".
"Freety" to argue "a gala match."
"Beauty" also to see - as "near" - that France has become a very high-level team" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a work of thunder," he became enthusiastic.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would well share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians become great," he pointed out.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You are going to report on the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento begins with a great deal of optimism his return to Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams had missed realism.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt in the shadow, the Selecçao, which has been on hand since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to blow up.
In view of the match go (0-0), Friday in Zenica hell, it was obvious that the games were not made.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, of course, but it has been unable to mark this so precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk because we haven't marked an outside goal"
But at home, in their bright Stadium of the Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a public who should be there as boiling, even though the party obviously announces itself "very tight," said a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We're waiting for a very tight match, but we're absolutely convinced we can take the top," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012", however, relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The no one reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
No one can suffice for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk, because we haven't marked an outside goal," Bento regrets.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and who has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you're realistic this time.
