A Republican Strategy to Prevent Obama’s Reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth and affirms that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what is happening in Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of the American governments promulgated, from 2009, new laws that made the process of registration or voting difficult.
This phenomenon has spread since the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote were introduced in 41 states during 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, those laws reduce the periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as an electorate on the day of polling and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit a photo identity document.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana law.
For this reason, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo identity document.
It is important to note that, unlike what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have any identity papers with photographs issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 per year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have a photo identity document.
And there's even more.
In many states students, voters who most vote for democratic candidates cannot use the photographed identity document issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote on Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004 no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two of the three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished the registration of voters on the same day of polling in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service to voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, election registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favour the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida elections, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13 per cent of the state voters.
In the case of Hispanics it was exactly the same.
They represent only 11 per cent of voters, representing 24 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Ministry of Tax intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, it was possible to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the submission of a photographed identity document.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that with them it is intended to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A report by the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted those laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too soon to assert with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system scale will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this regard, measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Do you test or not do it?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough to cause men to doubt whether or not the detection tests should be done or not.
Do you do the test or not?
We've asked for advice from the experts.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a high rate of contact between sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who were not.
The study, with a follow-up to 12 years of age, also showed that there are between 30 and 40% possibilities for metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African descent have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are painless.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his or her cancer. All options are to be offered, and not necessarily to treat prostate cancers that do not prevent long-term life, in which case it should be chosen for active monitoring of the disease.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, as such cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer them treatment.
We have increasingly determined precise criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.
This document can be downloaded (for the moment only in English, but translations will be offered soon) at: http://ca.movember.com/en/men-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We believe that if everyone eats well and moves well enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would be at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Society against Cancer.
Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
One hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced to half.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the appearance of the disease, according to the CSC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering from colorectal cancer.
Charcoal products should also be avoided.
The preservation of the meat for its smoked, dried or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, his investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to CSC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one found a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, another observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about the concerns and family background of each one with his doctor.
"To do the detection test does not cause cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not entirely clear that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at an important physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still lacking to be completely safe.
However, we assume that this is Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem few. We will see what it is about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and do not try too hard, because it will end up doing harm.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics in it: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantical state"; a "state" which consists, largely, of some of its characteristics.
Physicians classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we meet the good citizens called farms, who wisely obey Pauli's beginning.
And on the other hand there are boins, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of whom we will not talk here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate themselves and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bounties, you might highlight here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone to a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is about another field, the Higgs camp, which needs to be "disordered" so this boson will appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it must reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were an frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide across the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN (the great Hadron collisionr is a 27 km circle ring!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept by itself stuck at the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what "can you provide" all these investigations?, asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and MS predictions.
On the other hand, many earnestly wish to be found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that taps certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation concerning gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of such research on our day-to-days is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that it will have any.
For them to see: early in the 1960s, laser pioneers in the laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in Bell laboratories, where laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "labour apparatus".
Imagine...
Moreover, applications can also proceed from all the instruments surrounding the investigation.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light picker in 1969 during his optical research.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this catcher now serves as an "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which was valued by the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that we never know...
Palliative care, the best way to die.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In his Commission to die in dignity, Quebec had recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed early as a bill is being prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year breath.
"I've been given five years of life, but I've been like this for seven years," says one pass, lying in his bed in the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," she continues.
The disease has caused her damage: a huge weakness that prevents her from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of a tasty lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Valent, even smile, talk to strangers who give him attention, bring him medication, and offer him a bath.
The bravery of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for me to heal diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found remedy to that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man is standing on foot," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois Center.
Returning to her childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the ability of the person to accept that regression," she notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
Mrs. A., 89-year-old's greatest fear is to die "conscious and drowning."
But the disease has made her children discover.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any more desires left in this life," she says, before I accept that she is put on a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, one last visit of your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers a group of volunteers the care of the body and helps to feed.
They are palliative care given when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know we're all gonna die someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the central doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
On dying are offered mouthwashs with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, her son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days pass without ever being the same.
Alongside a 94-year-old man who savors his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of cancer," Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
53% of patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the end of his life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care centre.
And several agencies, such as Victor-Gadbois and Grand Montréal's home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative deficiency in the health care of Quebec that makes many doctors specialized in palliative care support the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to demonstrate their opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not sufficiently competent to ensure that anyone has the right to palliative quality care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in emergencies suffering great pain without doing what is needed to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get proper care."
And at the same time, many oncologists are obsessed with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard’s survival hopes were already low when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my uncle that she wanted to stop the treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she said.
"But she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who ask to die are grateful to their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereu, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain-control treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of the suffering.
More and more, the unsatisfied disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be relieved."
The implementation of this report has been possible through a Journalism Fellowship of Canada's Health Research Institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fund raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia count, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobists are part of.
A "industry" which came too dear to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's funny how the system sprays once we've been hunting the big media," ironiza Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the escalation of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into the wrongs linked to road contracts in Quebec, that the liberal prime minister at that time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine funding of parties and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts," including some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, while he hopes to be able to "show the stratagems that exist behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies to its team of government actors, researchers and analysts.
This unit also works with the police of the "Marteau Squadre", which, since 2009, have made Montreal's "Square Cartel" moderate to inflate contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has registered fraud and corruption charges against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
Reimbursements are suspected in exchange for public contracts.
It has been formally accused of engineers of Montreal's road network and of entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambien.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the Mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambipa distributed money to right and left during the 2000s, providing more than $88,000 in Canadian dollars (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal collection of funds for the former Liberal Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, explained this perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and company bribes from the construction sector for a total of $736,000, all of which in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs affected.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received cash for inflating invoices between 30 and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his dirty money arks.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early in November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, he has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of campaign money was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she ensures that she pulls "from a thread so that she can understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the guilty."
And he adds that the process is "sorry, but positive."
We are cleaning up the wounds but it would require a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that doubtful practices do not repeat.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is mostly concerned about the role of the 'politicals elected in the light of the stratagem'.
Estimateing 70% of the share of dirty money that was earmarked for the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, irony: "I have been told that this is just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100 to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to it, "while electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It advocates a complete revision of the system of public procurement and financing of the parties: "we can't fall any lower; go to the bottom of things, bravely, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story goes hand in hand with the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look at the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
Day-by-day advance to your side.
Technical staff have also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements make me daily to raise the level of my game.
In one game, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't warm up.
From my beginnings in the preformation center of INF Clairefontaine until my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always moved forward to busy steps.
He's going to get the benefit of the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to fighting high-level games.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my positioning.
It is supported by attachments like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no equal person in League 1 and it is among the best European trainers.
It has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He's been working with big players.
I think other titles will be taken in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
Your confidence in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has removed our leader's position.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our greatest objectives is the Champion League: we have classified ourselves for the eighths in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first of our league in front of the Port so that we can receive the eighth round of finals.
Can the PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is being given to its means of implementing this project.
Don't win the drink in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in bringing us that title of champions.
In the last season, we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a rather better season.
This year I think it'll be good.
Even if the major teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media are waiting for more than the PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who are still finding things to reproach us is a little frustrating.
We wonder what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City which, after two seasons, has not managed to be classified for eighths of the end, and they have also invested very much!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be to neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "pulled" by this new PSG.
That proves that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up carrying the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better say we have a "Zlatandendendance."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he wears a lot of goals.
He's come to prove he's the star of League 1.
And he has demonstrated on all the teams that he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect man and player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 Eurocopa with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and I got stronger.
Today I get to play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the "blues."
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and this is due to our exemplary behavior today.
What view do you have of Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the "blues"?
He's getting results.
They are well located in the classification group for the World.
The selector is rigorous, close to players and inspires to win.
As was Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of 16 October in Spain serve to set the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn't lived a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
In contrast to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technology, the political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol to the way BitTorrent allows the exchange of files equal to.
About 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin's contribution, after reaching the top of $30 (€23) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, before today's rounding the ten dollars (quotations are censused on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not impressive if we compare it with world changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "that competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual coins such as "credit", used to advance in a video game and which can be won by playing or can be bought (and even occasionally cashing).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositors of accounting books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins changes consist of the public account book, which spreads across the network.
The key point is to write that new transaction in that book.
This is due to the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file-cutting, i.e. transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers "cook" the new transaction and add a number before "twrinkling" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any change would change the mark.
If, to commit a fraud, one user would like to pay twice with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphaned, as both have different tracks.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the one-hundredth, which leaves a broad margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network already has its heights.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The fault used does not affect the same protocol", says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Initiative in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November the "giant casualties" were launched.
"$30,000 has been changed," rejoiced Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a teaching book on that currency, creates much in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which is cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain in the anonymity.
The system is easy to start up in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for you to provide a address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", Pierre Noizat needs, which ensures you have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to be imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change," he says.
Moreover, in its report the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of their territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished mainly the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, more the wounded and the maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads of refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the times of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes unite the Jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerates, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which observed from the top of the hills planted by almonds thanks to the French credits, was made by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attacks, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His take of control of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the darkness of their peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old lotahidines, the current government and current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, being made with government land to resell them as suns for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived in the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to work on those young people who will not want to return to the darkening of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are hungry for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish brochures that present a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstitution of the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, removing the position of the prime minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no packaging has been fixed and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, governmental control would have been necessary.
The rumor that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth was widespread.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take over them.
No energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, no mining operation.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig out the huge Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "wine the hearts and spirits" and to perform the impossible task of making the aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, eager to obtain local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increase of crop surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in those valleys which are often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled and direct civil aid.
A Constitution with Forums in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever with respect to the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, he decided to play the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote for its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And nearly two years ago, Egypt has used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial shocks.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues "treasoning his word" and "twisting the right".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a measure to bring the institutional and political crisis to an end and accelerate the transition process.
In the next 15 days a referendum should be held.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to give up their draft explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview to the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains a ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or vote on my text or keep full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, a vast majority of Islamist, voted the text yesterday.
The majority of the Liberals did not reach the call.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not make their views valued.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the quorum required, 11 people, substitute members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As expected, the articles voted unanimously.
On the other hand, the commentators are grateful that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed almost at the time of the prayer, so that several members of the committee came to think that the time of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 of the Constitution of 1971, which stated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law, remains the same as that of the Constitution of 1971."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the norms", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than an advertising squabbling.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is made through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who must confirm his conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next director of this university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
The majority of the jurists who have worked on this text are not olemmas but university students, some of whom are trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might be raised in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to pronounce themselves above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms concerning the extended powers entrusted to the President of the Republic.
Muslim Brothers will claim that there are few compared to those during the previous regime.
Another conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
As the military wishes, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Civil prosecutions in military courts will not be prohibited either, as requested by human rights associations.
These also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberal.
Blasphemy is maintained and now insults are banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, reports Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive was the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to leave last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state manifested themselves on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the ombligation of the world and a sea of salmon
The promised Earth combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence on the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
Anyone who enters this "Baptismal Stack" is believed to receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine into the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the nets filled.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers travel here on the Viacruci or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Vía Dolorosa").
It begins at the Fortaleza de Antonio, the Pretoire, where the trial was held, and continues along the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Unction and the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Obligation of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here with their wishes, which will then become reality.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are in mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And reaching there by their own means, they can only those who devote themselves to climbing.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
Even there, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly dwelled pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On one trip you won't be able to visit all of them.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Rollos of Qumran, discovered in the caves of the Jewish desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In its exhibition of paintings there are canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha Bathroom Museum, which are some old Turkish bathrooms rooms with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth going through the exclusive Ralli private museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
The entry is free, and categorically no donations are accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Memorial of Children, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they are even bathed in the winter months, as the temperature of the water is not lower than 21 degrees and the air is warmed up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that can easily hold up to those who can't swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salt water, salmura and healing muds and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to order their broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of old age
It preserves the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed through the famous maritime route between Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, this was where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, carried a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "mix" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds coming from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph yourself.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30 per cent of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to bring it in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed to shekels (currently $1-3,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the High City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travel on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transhipping for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Saturdays is celebrated the Sabbath.
From Friday night until the sunset of Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupt their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There we offer a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are soft garbanzo balls, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no street dogs.
On the other hand, there are many well-nourished cats that "pass to their taste" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the cars parked.
The rodents love the crowded places and do not reject the golosins.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to the insurance, it goes for $15 a day.
And the rental of a bicycle will go out for 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012 more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who arrived to travel the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, amounting to 51 per cent at the same 2010 rate, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: Immigrants Save for the Language
While representatives and human rights defenders discuss the implications of the law on compulsory review, they have already appeared in the countries of bullies trading with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens from Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December a law enters into force, according to which each worker must carry out an examination to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, community services institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, in time, as they promise in the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be sufficient to give up the examination of the language, if not also of Russian history and of the fundamentals of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language are the exception.
They will not be subject to this law by persons who were able to obtain their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of review centres will be sponsored by the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of the Peoples' Friendships, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be tested in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 centres of this kind are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the representatives of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask this question to the press: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will bring the mandatory knowledge of the language, for both Russians and immigrants themselves?
First, representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from “work slavery”.
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labour migrants, explains Victor Sebelev, chief of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before its departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
Immigrants have problems without professions, education, those who don't know the language and they don't have medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the immigrant future will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, with the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" to a creepy and narrow cockroach, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but when they arrive they are cheated, they are deprived of their passports, they do not pay their promised wages," confirmed the Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be angry, boss!
However, in the meantime many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do they know the language of the country they want to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don't even have anything to feed the children, because they don't talk anymore about dressing them, putting on them and buying them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as language law is concerned, rights defenders point to an important point.
The tests will be carried out only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no review and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbid the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and language difficulties in itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a fake inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry fake documents, we are not registered and the cases of extortion appear.
"They ask us for one hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov, told the journalists.
"Come on, don't be silly, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was revealed that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several "false" language certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed on standard colour printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand roubles.
This is twice and half more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker 3,000 rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that the "diplomas" cannot be purchased, they converge with government officials and rights defenders.
To date, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not have successfully passed the first time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigorously with regard to the owners of weapons of civil use.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Shooting fires during wedding celebrations where there were fortunately no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow's lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Tore seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and to raise the minimum age for licensing to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard hand policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "responsive rigidity be discontinued".
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of recorded weapons is minimal, commented at the BBC news service of Russia, criminal lawyer Vasily Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 firearms offences were committed during the six months of 2012 in relation to a total of 1168 offences registered for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be a drawback for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at low price.
In the meantime, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says the retired colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the Senior State.
Screenshot of the website accepting arms requests
The first, "arm or military prowess," that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and the same Caucasians," Baranets said.
The next type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police stores and stolen weapons directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are being sold from military arsenals.
There were often explosions in many military arsenals.
"There are proven versions that some fires were first provoked to cover the lack," says one ex-military.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
"They have now proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
Large numbers of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of illicit arms supply to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problems Analysis and Public Management Planning.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose topic revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market's weapons have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," says the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent are "illegal archaeology".
The dependent on one of the arms stores, who requested that his name was not mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal excavators had not bought them for a long time because they were too old.
More often, it says, suppliers turn to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some portage, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This brings the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan is to be carried out, they buy evidence to illegal arms traders," he adds.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer often find themselves through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed that I go to the platform "Begovaya", where I would be a man who would take me to a "squinita" where we could negotiate.
Of the price of the weapon, I only found out there."

"To get a gun I need a friend to have contacts," says the store's dependent. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there also you have to get there, say "from Mr. Ivanovich, who asked him to tell him that a tooth had fallen from his daughter."
I can even get a couple of steel knobs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I'm not going to flatter him.
Newmen are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s when an article on this subject was available.
Schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't "all."
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets' words, does not offer cat for hare: everything there is can be proved.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; let's go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop of sofas
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where you offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No document or personal meetings are required for this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertising notice "Buying a gun or a machine gun."
There users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (conserved spelling).
"I buy TT. Moscow gun," he implicitly asks his question "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handed captures of those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military commentator and expatriate Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: usually, the website is registered out of the reach of Russian laws.
People do orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions for him to know where the weapon is hidden," says the NGO's press secretary "The right to arms", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one remains without a gun and is put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handed captures of those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the onion, and then to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov per $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
One and a half months should be expected.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the middle-ranking chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which constitutes 22.900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are being hit.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, in the United States, there has been a wave of protests against low wages paid at the Walmart corporation supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and to dawn in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the goal of protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, the orgy of casualties that captured millions of people, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some Walmart corporation workers, who employs 2.2 million people in the world, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside the trade unions and left-wing activists in the corporate stores, whose products are directed to people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything, from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why many badly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and supply of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because he pays little to his workers.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as lack of mountings or hand scanners.
This "Black Friday" participants demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of the corporation's health insurance went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at California University in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, this will cost the $3.2 billion corporation.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the pay increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they'll spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they're spending now.
Walmart supporters commented with satisfaction that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" extended in its shops from 8 o'clock on Thursday to midnight the next day and during that time Walmart sold around 5000 items per second.
In total, their registering boxes carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website, that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had only been "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"Free house!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not precisely the Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and therefore for now there is none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and don't pay for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, to me it's incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald's and worked there, behind the exhibitors, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few viewed this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly run into some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a comment whose author says it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast-food waiters and cooks start paying for at least $15 per hour, i.e., that they be doubled their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing them from this right and punishing the activists of the union movement with bows and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main features is excessive staff rotation.
Disorders
Noiseful protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in half the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians participated, particularly the member of the Jumaane Williams City Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's says he's selling billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received the support of other prominent Democrats in New York, such as the mayor's candidate in the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast food sector so that they can get fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New York deserves."
As described in the New York Times newspaper, this has been the biggest manifestation of this guy in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were fast-food workers, working tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is still unclear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy."
The theme of the increased reality, so popular among the fans of modern technologies, is recently perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Early in the summer, at its annual conference Google showed a moving model and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it became clear that for the scientists of that company, glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted to the perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of the study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to the interaction person-computer, but we are also trying to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now mankind in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with his finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everybody is interested in gesture control.
- What about the future?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes on 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional viewing systems, based on different technologies, including those of design.
The world of information technology must be released to ours, to our physicist, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, hell with those silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, you can't consider a panacea, you're waiting to solve the privacy issue, because you don't always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each one in his own field.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose moves, but shorter.
In addition, gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda can?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, do you want to force users to adapt to what they can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good in-depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Are you missing resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
I mean, we have to remember not only the resolution on axes X and Y, but also on Z.
It is also important to speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps movements are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that modern serial-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects man-machine interaction.
It would be very useful for my work to have an equivalent of such a device, but that it does not require contact so that the tables per second are more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "camera", one of which is in fact the infrared transmitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
On the contrary, increase and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a Kinect flexible analog, play with the camera's location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of enhanced reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up an intelligent phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased reality "transmutable" when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (private things you can only see them), but also your weakness: an enhanced reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no touch-up!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that the increased reality is the seventh break in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth one could be the addition of touch sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as image support.
Log the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really oriented to bring tangiability to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is found gives a sensation similar to that one feels if someone is blowing it in the fingers, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- You tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what it looks like he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here there is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of the belts of running (not like those of gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, cheating in the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That is what makes work attractive with virtual reality for researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Personal subjective taste in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even knowing Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philophosophos of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg's vanguard at the end of the 80 - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and lifts all the mood.
Recently, he took into his hands an organ and became the organizer of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, by his existence bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little grey arouses aggressiveness and agitation of nothing good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you understand you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my works were displayed.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was already finished.
I went to the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... it was important for me to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the Bohemia of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Names, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an entertainer of many programs before the time of Halifax-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club, are the remains of the Clinique of Art.
There were our employees and regular customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man to whom the truth, honesty and culture of the past century are pleased.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something in your work that's recognizable.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them are clearly expressed the current and the occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns".
The clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like this is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything is swallowed up and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change in clothing.
Now one is followed by clothing, oriented externally, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person shouldn't even be given a hand, but spit on his face.
And deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
A cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but can the best commercial art be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touchy.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
People used to gather in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simplanes others.
Now they've all been divided into microcommunitys, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to like everyone.
Now we have to think who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov arrive for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, the sex-social sphere works there.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10 thousand will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything will fade.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you've achieved.
When he was young, he made such paintings that a collector had hanging them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
Now the concepts are often confused.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied money just to paint pictures.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: official of culture.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When kings were the right ones, it was otherwise, kings might not understand the culture very well, but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level who properly evaluate them and open the way for them.
Now it's prospering subjective personal taste.
The same is true, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's for you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious about exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art look fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Lighting up in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with an assassin asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board start looking for a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of ingravity or on the same planet of spare?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says Chief Investigator of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in Venus' orbit... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with the flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been conducted for half a century.
Four generations of barley growers did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breed of insects in the orbit, small flies of fruit, the drosophiles.
In 1979, they sent to the codorniz egg space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of ingravity.
We get a normal pollination as a result.
But then trouble starts.
"The problem is that this chicken has to find support, it must stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they didn't find support, the poultices would turn around at random.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
Pollutants did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got them born, but then we left them because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the polluters in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In spring 2013 experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" they will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, who were sent to space already with fetuses.
At first, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, when losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a proper emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our flying gaviota, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight to space.
She may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has responded to this question," says the veteran of the Vakhtang Vachnadze aerospace sector.
In June 1964, only after one year of flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told who after long flights everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, Russian hero, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the cosmonauts preparation centre is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
Under conditions of null flotability, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates ingravity.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable, yet hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its native element.
Little amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is found about 9 months inside its mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier to get used to water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bathroom only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if ingravity is a more natural state for a newborn, it is necessary for women to gravitate, the force of gravity.
In the ingravity of the abdominal muscles and pelvis are decrepitated very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, let's skip that, trusting in the action of stimulants for delivery.
You can, of course, give birth to a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear with a special suit for training, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we're going to do together, by allowing a child to be born in a strange environment, will give us the opportunity to bring to Earth a disabled person, to a totally inadequate person," says the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Chief of NKú: The inspection of the system "švarc" has not given to the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is being skewed.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NKÚ) said in an interview with Aksuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," he describes the current situation.
The joint checks of the Czech and German inspectors also arrive at similar conclusions.
As an example of a wrong practice, he mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the system "švarc".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Cyvic Democratic Party) would not bother the businessmen with inspectors. So, is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls or to demand obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you discussed the common project between the Czech team and the German team, in which the legislation on public procurement was compared in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started to perform about two years ago.
In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public procurement is to be organised, this follows the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself.
We have united everything and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more stricter and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but rather to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually do? What do you think are the conclusions?
It is precisely a common control of this type that could help us to stop investing our efforts in the creation of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting something right at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long term, criminal actions.
But not by the fact that we reduce the award limit means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "papelo", that those who want to look for system failures can do it more easily than if the limits remain as high as now.
You talk about the problems in our country with the transfer of legislation governing the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized otherwise?
As for the offices, such as the NKÚ, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a college too, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also at some point analogous, however, as Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are even at this level. In this respect it is slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, there in Germany, are controlled at the Federal Court of Auditors.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to draw up a comparison without specific data. However, Germany is still a model in some respects, but it cannot be accurately specified in what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of the inspectors?
That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make this kind of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as models must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, it wouldn't be any benefit to you to work with our office, would it?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean for its Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post controls, there must be a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool for "non-economic risk detection", for which we have passed almost 14,000 public tenders, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are amended, the conditions of some types of the selection process are corrected and similar.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be beneficial or rather a barrier to the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is probably a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "strengthens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and each unrespected law on public procurement meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law this way?
I don't think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and do not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this road starts.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to the fact that it is autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the prime minister of government can prevent the performance of the Office that has an obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
You can say, "Let's change the law and allow it," but you can't say that we'll do anything.
In the law on public procurement, legislation is quite strict as to how it is to be formally acted, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
On the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best offer for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct, that is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads have ice plates, although they are mostly transitible
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are transitible, some should be extremely cautious.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitible, but they had ice and snowboards.
The temperature falls and will vary between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is fine.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metal Mountains, the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to the information of the road traffic control centre in the region.
The R6 and the first-class road in the region are now transportable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and resbaladed.
In addition, all second- and third-class routes, including mountain roads, are accessible.
However, in some of them there are still straggles with ice debris and overcrowded snow.
There is a need for increased attention on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Pardubice Region and Hradec Kralové
On some roads in East Bohemia there is danger of ice and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have formed on the roads, reports on its pages the Road and Highways Directorate.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
There can be ice cream in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and above all on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Krkonoše mountains in Orlické hour.
There is a snow layer in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemia area, today the sky will be between clear and partially clouded, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually oscillat between three low zeros and a positive degree, will blow a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are transportable today in the morning, although caution must be extreme and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the first hours of the morning there will be ice, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent descent of the temperatures, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will meet with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what is revealed from the information of the road operations control centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is nearly unrestricted, although caution is recommended, especially on the road between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most of the first-class roads is dry and without ice.
In the Pilsen and Tachov road area border with Germany there may be ice plates.
The second and third categories are wet, so in this case it is also warned of ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the least transit routes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers who head to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will meet with partially empty snow.
After chemical treatment, it was still snowing at the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road workers removed the snow during the night; on the Šumper road they piled about three centimeters of snow, according to the track managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transportable without restrictions.
"In the tallest areas of the Šumper road, there are remains of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with average waste snow in the direction of Jeseník", a operator of Šumper road administration in the ČTK has confirmed today.
On the ground and at night they also went to the Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the slopes of the highest areas are now cleared and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are transportable without restrictions, in Šternska the drivers should drive with caution on the forest tranches, where the roads are still wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
North Bohemia road operators have reported on complications in different sections at first hour in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lowest areas, so the ice and snow obviously remain in the shoe. Instead, in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
There have been no complications of service due to the mint.
Road operators have notified of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and the sky will be cleared and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfavourable conditions have been announced on Road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Hornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just less than a month, the end of the world will come, how do you feel about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to hold on to.
To the music group The Tap Tap we rather like to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-wide charity we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that is at the end of the May calendar set out for 21 December at 11:10 in the morning.
On the previous day, on 20 December at 21 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will finish at approximately the same time when the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
Initially it was my idea, then we went for the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to bring together enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, along with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear in the beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time in the three concerts.
The hymns will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the role of Jesus in the videoclip, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial acts and concerts...
We put all our efforts to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in and have fun working with us.
What will the money collected in the concerts against the end of the world be used for?
The equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap at Jedličk.v useav.
The students at Jedličkčv school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they do fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient economic means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedličk.v, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and interpreters are involved in each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, Lesbians Support, Illustosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will act.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other "spectacular action" similar in the future?
In May we will act for the first time at the festival Pražské jaro, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as hard as it might seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, boxes with the instruments...
So far, however, we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not stop surprising me.
Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything went out without problems.
Thanks to the departures abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still no frequent movement of a person alone around the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in wheelchairs in lifts, there it is not.
Luckily, a civil partnership has been set up to work towards addressing the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what ways should we take examples from more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with serious disabilities move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever you want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we go a little ahead!
A respectful society or without barriers is one thing, but when the moment comes when prominent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers start changing everything really.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličk, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And over time, as our moderator La Angelovič says, he left us a little of his hands (Laughter).
However, popularity has not come up until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us enough to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the European Union's assistance, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
You meant to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something else can be done.
The show world is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in his own way, to welcome all new things with caution and takes a long time to accept them.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and those we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and to develop, of course, the condition that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something works out for people with disabilities, then, it is not just a step forward for them, but for society as a whole.
Did you help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and with their head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to practice, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
Currently, the Tap Tap group has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
There is only one: Laa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever wants and wants will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 a.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Brno Fléda and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through video conference to sing the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World, Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources necessary to finance multi-functional equipment of the STUDEO educational centre without barriers in Jedličk.v usedav of Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entry in the pre-sales option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency countries last week Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member of ESA of the former Eastern Europe bloc after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the Agency's project commission.
However, Poland’s way to the cosmos started a long time earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before the Second World War, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the participants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won in France the award Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was put on one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a dredgedina was built in Poland, which was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known, nor are the project details known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the drain or for its braking.
Information about this Dresin is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the stored material, it is evident that the investigation reached the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna and rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committeeet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all draft missile techniques for military use and coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemmy, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, the creation of a society that would devote itself to cosmonautics was proposed.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) had aspired to become a member of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronauticals.
He completed this post until his death in 1959.
As of 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna) rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 metres, about 80 cm in length and did not reach the 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and the two-stage RM-2 rocket air tests started in the Błędów desert in the summer of 1959.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of a real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the height wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor to the first rockets of the RM type was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from one another by space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, at the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and at the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket, the first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km of height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was subsequently built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research into the cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the social labour law is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the law social unrest.
The resolution aroused a heated discussion in society.
It will, of course, be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less regulatory competition.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of the major differences in the labour cost (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to this end "proposes a drop" of the competitor's price in order to make itself with most of the market and thus to increase its profit margin.
On a large scale, it means, for most entrepreneurs, to move production abroad, to buy there cheaper or either disappear. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, as a result, it is not responsible for unemployment that this phenomenon generates, it necessarily increases the state's social expenditure.
This whole situation fosters the total uninterest of employers for paying taxes and for compensating the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of benefits.
The situation is so universally known that no specific statistical data is required.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create situations in certain economies in which Governments of such countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thereby attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own people without regard to social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially in respect of wages.
This, on the one hand, takes place through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees to work rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people who receive this type of aid is now about one million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly common case occurs: people employed with such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public in connection with the situation of auxiliary employees of the German Federal Parliament.
The saving measures of virtually all the southern states of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same situation: people, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to malvive with a painful wage within society, hoping that someday it will reach the private investor capital country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African continue to work for a small part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the extent that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, which leads the economy to its failure.
Private capital defends the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by entering control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its selfishness on the political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in the very powerful and omnipresent practice, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that is manifested in the area of corruption, mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
The situation in Germany is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This kind of bill is passed later in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as is announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is clear that democracies with liberal orientation are quickly in a situation like the one that Appianos describes in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in the times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating and the administrations occupied force."
In exchange for bribes, favours obtained illegally and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unhindered, and people went to the polls with the pre-compliant vote... "there were no people in character who aspired to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "He began to speak seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appianos thought of Pompeya, Caesar went up to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that the present society is based on unconsidered preferences of the individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as that of then, a decadence of the unprecedented elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next blow.
The real demolition is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in the past and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international and within the EU, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and which weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the chaos laboratory.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose scribble prays "Let's not forget how fragile we are" (we don't forget how fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, various reactions have arisen.
One, on the side of Israel, argues for the right to self-defense and encapsulates the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide against Palestinian Arabs and stamps Israel of a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the periodic killings and who is the victim. At the end of the day, the citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who benefits from the tensions that have been dragged for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small surface of Middle East land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions to which I have come on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on whom or which group of people is the main driving force behind the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind the history of the struggles for power is in the front row.
At every time we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if there was someone behind his throne who directed his actions toward a certain objective.
We must accept that we live at a time that concentrates the wealth of the world on the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power it implies has not been able to reach one generation.
Of these astronomically rich families one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much to them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which always meant strengthening for them.
They have important stakes in almost all the world's central banks and in those countries where they are not represented, declared or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan they were 7 countries, after Iraq's attack they were 5, after the overthrow of Gadafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschilds, began during the Secession War to print money and was killed in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the EDF for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
His desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war marked the goal of eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second war wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third war aimed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (like slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so much resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a preliminary project for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the richest family group, along with the Rothschilds, operates follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and they always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after that, the First World War was unleashed, they destroyed zarista Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War suddenly and unjustifiedly ended from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end the zarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for World War II, the bankers and politicians allowed themselves to create, in a hidden way, a conflictary situation following the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany, which created the optimal conditions for radicalization of impoverished masses. Afterwards, it was enough to serve the Germans the Führer solution, which was strong enough and simple and pointed out to the culprits, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority to represent and represent as well the role of the fifth column, which caught the flame and caused the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the basis for the massive immigration of Jews into Palestine and started the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope that the international bankers had tied it to in principle or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers managed to start it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now along with the Arab population or generally Muslim Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also at international level. Let us take as an example how Israeli sympathizers and detractors are divided in a tacit way.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice generate injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at first it was the greed of some individuals and their pursuit of world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their representatives, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare the war to Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz, by which it passes 20% of all world oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are now shown the words David Rockefeller pronounced in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls all his beings.
"And it obliges all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark in the right hand or in the front, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of its name.
It is necessary to understand this: whoever has two fingers in front, who adds the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo Film: If you get raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist students held the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who, after the revolution, fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer any positive perspective: throwing the shah over the edge could not be allowed, since, if it did, it would endanger the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified even more with the failed attempt to free hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the U.S., their destiny caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran made a decisive contribution to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck discusses an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before taking up the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated periple, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, thus helping a covert story: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan by the expert in "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
For the lie to seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film the mood states are combined. On the one hand we find well documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits we show emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
In addition, scenes from the CIA's central and other institutions: men brought along who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the office halls, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respected director and his manner of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Friendly, Adios" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which action has no place in the city of Boston, where it grew up.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed old film directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is "frozen" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of taking the embassy is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that at the same time conveys the excitement of the confusion and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect on fictional scenes (the imposter team at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And they are quite well arranged. Sometimes something is added to reality: here everything doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene in which it is facing the crisis at Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its track become a madness).
The weakness of Argo is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, appreciate its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70's.
But if it collapses, that'll be hard.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflated balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which presents a survey of the most absurd banking rates each year, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in leadership positions in large European companies," explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the nominal absurdities, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women had better prices in life insurance because they were objectively at a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the binding addition of biofuels to fuel that, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers of all life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark guideline the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the substantial increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual prohibition of the use of the term "untar mantequila" or the removal of the classical bulb of trades has been criticized.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often takes such decisions under the pressure of one or other commercial or industrial lobby whose petitions in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that high-quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curves".
The European Commission argued that this only seeks to harmonise non-homogenised national standards so far, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive involves a waste of edibles.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU prescription last year that inflatable balloons on the market it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction is also in force for use by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to injure the sensibility of Greece, one should speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Bank ovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laisz Fair, appointed in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then surpassed, for example, the volume established for preserved mushrooms, which posed a substantial threat of fines.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the request for grants.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have sea.
We call on the European Union to make compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued this with the fact that in our country there was a lot of grain and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the stores full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission expressed its willingness to help the Czech Republic and organized a public invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). In particular, it is intended to draft requests for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The Member States' guidelines are often full of criticisms, EU regulatory efforts, and more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to a number of experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that the Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fiber, as is the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious of these battles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the request of Olomouc, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became called "tuzemak".
Only products produced from sugar cane distillate cane may be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected EU designations of origin, together with known feta and gorgonzola cheeses worldwide, the Mazapán of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, for example, are already the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the Pohořelice carp and Třeboň and even the variety of hops of Žatec.
As protected EU maras, you can be proud of the ginger bread of Pardubice and the boats of Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did the election for president come about?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't apply.
But I can no longer bear to see how they have been stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves get taxed, and the retirement age.
He had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to make a solution to change it.
And since I am already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon thereafter it has set itself on its way to the presidency.
Aren't you giving your back to those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I needed that if I was elected senator, I would present my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and as much mandate as possible.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we pounce anyone who wants to start a change.
To this the media are added, who despise you and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I'm told I've bribed journalists what I've been a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents itself to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership above twenty million.
To do so, you must change the law.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the guiding profession to be recognized as self-employed, and we have succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether right-wing or left-wing, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential for the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without lacerations or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be a man of right or left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more than left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we move on.
I don't care if someone's right-wing or left-wing, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or the ODS and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
He jokes about you being populist.
But you're not proving it by what you're saying?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of the parliament, you have only orders.
And with this it cannot survive in the long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you address and talk to people, you will, for example, achieve criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And eventually they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character pointing to the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Let us take the President's direct election by chance, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say that I'm just a fan, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I just started politics and tried to get as much support as possible for my programme.
I'm trying to move things forward myself, but in case it doesn't go well, I'll leave it in six years, and I'll go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that I don't do anything with a person, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, if you'd better be encouraged to apply for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed fraud with light heating oils.
I presented myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not attend the polls, and those who did so voted on the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it because I don't have time for it, to check the unattainable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money either.
I have no money for the campaign to the presidency, there are only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
Speaking of property statements, how is yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have an estimated land of 25 million, a valued ten million floor, another land taxed in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued in one million, and in the account I have a couple million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, was fighting against evil and injustice.
Does Aston Martin drive, his property is valued at 60 million and he doesn't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to be in debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that you do not have any sponsor shows that there is not too much interest in my programme.
And I don't have an obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The campaign costs essentially cover what I will receive in terms of Senator ' s salary.
For example, I could not pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to earn money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So you'll continue your business to live?
Didn't you say before I was going to stop this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, in part I left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People wanted me to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How often do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I still win.
If I were president, then I'd quit business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently finished "bookmountain" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and at last there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a transecent passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "in addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one likes to go to those old fashion libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a city bedroom located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, bears the dubious honor of having made itself up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute somehow to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented on euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that's how the political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a whole master in the art of bar charts and responsible for fun buildings to the pair that cynics, took the theme with his usual serenity and came to the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around and shrugged with shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellows:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, the so-called `Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises at the expected location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and home buildings.
In early November the book mountains were awarded with the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the little town lacking history, which to date had nothing but to offer a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly township behind whose white façade one would rather intuit a milk center, now has a contemporary architecture work.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in his history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that it's a book paradise under a cheeseburger.
It is true that there is an elevator that carries us right to the center of this massive mountain, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to melt with their topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully crystallized interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor covered and the elegant lighthouses unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
Upstairs can be seen by the park banks, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally the book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is we put paws up the classic space configuration and pull the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of mural coating, parapet and balconies at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that is how one day, in a frizzy farm, we met the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and in the Netherlands camps, a plastic fabric of few millimetres of thickness has been used as a basis for subjecting the roots of crops.
This is cheap and efficient material.
This thin tissue lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library this fabric was taken for the first time in such quantities until it obtained plates of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells of a new car mixture and sport shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of nearly 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the café you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy delicious Dutch croquetas and their figus planted in huge macetas.
These create a pleasant environment to the pair that maintains air moisture suitable for this mountain of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"Although it is difficult to believe it given its large acrystalated surfaces, this building is an exemplary project with regard to ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is situated under a huge crystal pyramid, even in the most sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences that cross the glass façade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable inner climate.
The rest is the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there, too.
Also, Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul".
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to give a book of their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete file; at present it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has closed down.
The shelves are packed.
"There is nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows your book is part of the library.
Although he's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved all success in this discipline queen that in the specialized argot is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uncultivated it may be.
Finally, a starting point to make up your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the observer status of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was to establish a flight ban zone.
This was finally declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because he is currently reorientating his foreign policy, moving away from a policy that is led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a consistent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to it.
I think they're still trying what their role will be, but they've already started the path to a "normal" foreign policy.
A similar foreign policy to countries such as France or Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy has a strong motivation for economic policy, i.e. exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the United Nations vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Near East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why it must be careful and not alienate from Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give it so much importance, since it's not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by refraining from voting in important decisions such as the Palestinian vote?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with this Germany has achieved a certain amount of respect.
After all, all of this has done nothing but show that it is a country to which they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the United States and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama government is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend this position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the extent to which it is attributed.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it maintains with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is nothing easy for Germany, whether simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a very dangerous subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really wish to take on a leading role?
Or might it still be hard for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to find a more important role.
If we look at the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that every time Germany takes its position as a leading actor, certain anti-German feelings are dispelled.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
Given this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
The U.S. influence on European policy is decreasing ever more, but the EU is not currently covering that gap, who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant to them or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, it's life!

"Market protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-known brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name, a name officially registered in China is hidden but has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real ones do not present a demand.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to keep track of their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of Puma sports items.
Pattloch opens an archiver in which he keeps seats from Beijing's brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in that of copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large stores of several plants exclusively dedicated to the sale of counterfeits.
However, the cases of Pattloch are of a different nature. On behalf of its clients, it fights against the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pa" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
referring to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty
"It's harmful to the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes water, the monopoly position disappears, and the damage that the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year China is, in size, the third market in luxury goods and the one that grows at a higher rate.
However, making the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the trademark register is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can be extended up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had been so long since the name of the claim had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is in bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarism because the process has damaged the China brand," Pattloch says.
This is sometimes the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a complaint against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that was recently absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
So to this day, the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, used at first a white and blue logo that largely remembered BMW; the matter was settled in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitationrs from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 there have been difficulties in the lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the situation of work emergency returned to normal."
Thus, the number of unprocessed claims has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year the CTMO registered over 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost one third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China is leading for the tenth consecutive year the list of new inscriptions around the world, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, $1,800 million in rights would have been paid.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
To fight this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting against a Chinese copyist in the courts.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the copywriter has managed to secure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also dismissed the appeal of the municipalities.
In the following two instances, Freudenberg was given reason, but the opposite side is still fighting today.
We have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the gates of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending resolution.
Wentzler trusted that he could resolve the issue favourably and praised the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review records up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "sum of six figures in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much we care," says Wentzler.
The dangers they face in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically, if the copyists there ensure the rights on unprotected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since abandoned this trade area, but it has been able to prevent registration.
"We must be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and counsel Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious in doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international brand rights legislation, but what needs to be done is "to record in China everything that can be susceptible to protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic can be much more expensive than simply a record.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would expel us from the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir and Swaziland rejoice the AIDS orphans
The history of a link that can exceed much more than 8.733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and mocasins look for the compass on parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to slowly raise the voices of the singers (contalt, low, tenor and soprano), rowing, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his closets by trying to get his strong, soft gestures sorted out.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the Imbongi choir tries a new song.
The 50 singers from 23 to 69 years old have also arrived from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorus voice has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS programme worldwide has approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already seropositive.
The Association Voices for Africa has found in Germany fathers for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, a child can be paired.
This contribution will cover the school registration, the uniform and will ensure you a hot daily meal at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirist".
In this room no one can speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been practicing songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometres straight from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a people called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the people in Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying over thirty years has become a habit.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this small population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than few.
In the beginning it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which since then has professionally taken care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the TSEs of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Laddillas and sarna are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more often given in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, tricomones, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrhea infections.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
There were approximately 2,700 cases in 2011.
This is a tenth part less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urination disorders, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100 per cent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if sexual partners are frequently changed.
If they are diagnosed early, most TSEs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, finally, but not less important, of the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
"In total, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of herself and with leadership abilities manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandparents.
The "gogogoes", as is called the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where to live and take care of children going to school every day and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cookers who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, has built two chickens and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has made it possible for many of the people to undergo HIV testing.
This is not obvious, since, despite the patents of this disease throughout the country, it is not often openly spoken about.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excess lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of life that is not officially accepted is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless timers who travel across the country and take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin contact against skin."
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years across South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost extreme of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; such recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and much joy, but it has also managed to rip a couple of tears to some other angry border soldier.
The trip always takes you to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children with aparinados.
Although this small population only appears on the maps, in the Ezulweni River Valley is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines," says the people of the place.
And after walking around the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the practice rooms of Bergheimer street full of singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Although it is the nearest planet to the sun, there is also ice water, as is revealed from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the planet's area that is permanently in the shadow.
It looks like this one's at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is likely to come from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that in their day collapsed against Mercury.
No one relates the finding of ice to the possibility that there is life on the planet, states the chief investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can be up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, findings could help to clarify how water and other life components have come to other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, the probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
Occasionally they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.

This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the " newborn" stars.
This region of star formation, called in a romantic way by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This sunscreen image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.

The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object with a simple view in the night sky.
With the telescope, however, the colors can be better appreciated.
The Helice Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this image of infrareds.

Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the Austral European Observatory shows the Trifide Nebula located several thousand light years in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided in three), since dark lines of dust divide the bright heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the Constellation of Officio, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years from the Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of fusion are fluctuated towards each other to end up crashing irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it with the nickname of Austral Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in Cefeo constellation.
The 1,400 light-year nebula is composed of dust particles that are between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years of Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest young star group of our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roses Nebula, there are also continuously new stars; 5,000 light years from the Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is not yet dust, just gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found above all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of this more economic construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search (SETI) you can help anyone with a computer, providing processing capacity.

Here rises the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on Mauna Kea's Hawaiian volcano were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a 30-meter mirror diameter.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 he has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers start from the basis that in the south pole of Mercury there is also ice.
However, there is no convincing evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have been pointing to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first that orbits around Mercury, now scientists are sure it is.

A search for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The trip through Talysh's mountainous region could qualify as wild and romantic.
The minibus moves through the sinuous road that passes next to wooded hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, you might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are located in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a town of which you don't know much, apart from which they perfectly dominate the Persians and the Azeri, and which are very long.
Our final destiny is Lerik.
This small city boasts a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit in at all in such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists hardly get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban cores, it takes eight hours because the road is one way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to Caspian oil has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilatea Fatulyeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulyeva indicates a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son died at the age of 136
However, the indisputable star of the museum is the pastor of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we take into account that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"Born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. It seems that he still had time to conceive a daughter more at the age of 136.
So was Şirali Müslümov wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hungarian Valley in Pakistan, they also live very old people," Scholz says, "there are many older men even in Sardinia."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age; maximum when there is no civil record.
Every day glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azeri Tourist Guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of talyshi.
The museum director, Ms. Fatulyeva, believes instead that the cause resides in the food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the food rich in the calories of talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially all the dairy products and many of which, besides, drink daily a glass of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97 he is relatively young for what is spread through these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves in an untiring way a huge tin of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughter, both became grandparents long ago.
They also play two small children on one side.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in typical glasses with a flat form.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the cloth hides two long braids of dark red hair that his son finds us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen and kept its color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been shopping at a supermarket in my whole life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything came back to his tail when the "loved father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult professing to the paternal figure of the nation, which runs its country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he handed over the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the older people of Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, a quantity with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And maybe Mirzayeva's son is right: "in our culture the older are highly respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is embroiled.
The future constitution, with the sharia as a base, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not flaunt in patetism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And let that happen is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to Christian Coptics, liberals, illustrated Muslims and seculars.
All of them, immersed without remedy so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile because of the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, has had to temporarily reverse the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand its "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
Indeed, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamic members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean as "principles"?
This was and is still open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that it has, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what suggests a new article added: all Sharia issues are mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be that way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh repression of the opposition.
Up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons after the dictator's fall.
As set out in the draft, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morale and its values".
This is so inaccurate in legal terms that with the help of this article State institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, this is nothing but censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, it prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacy.
However, it is unclear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits "offensive to people"
Is a president's caricature enough or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for his signature and that according to, his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to referendum.
"Revolution is back"
It has been weeks since the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday at Tahrir del Cario Square and swore to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end in defeat," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who occupies the third place in the lists of presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the bottom of the garbage of history".
Through Twitter he accused Morsi followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy".
"When he summons the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been purified," was quoted in the Egyptian media as opposing politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifestation; if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the salafists took part in the same in the cry of: "The people demand the application of the divine law".
They demanded Morsi to "clean up the country," while proclaiming: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, Morsi's supporters did not want to risk anything like that.
Muslim brothers claimed that both those opposed to the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their high and clear views.
Now would be the time to let the people decide in the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of Islamists is guaranteed by the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers of the State had this lawyer re-assigned.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Rather than strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protestant on Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian Rakfisk: the world's most mallysing fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country will remain in any connection with its greed for an extremely ill-fated fish?
Take a series of overly cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothing.
Leave him there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralysing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisites.
I'll meet you in the little town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is a saloon trick that lets itself stand in water during, depending on how painful you prefer it, up to a year.
As it darkens and gets colder, the Norwegians flock to a festival that is celebrated here in Fagernes, dedicated to this meal of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"It eats raw and then drinks aquavit glass of a drink," says Harvard Halvarsen, fireman of the city who is also known as the "General of the Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking an important amount of drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," says Harvard.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it is not bad; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty shook Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, fish was kept during autumn immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of the winter, when it is already well fermented, it comes out and, evidently with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it eats.
Only one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they emigrated mainly to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A flow of Swedish inhabitants, the old rival and even does not make much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be an important part, an essential, but quite ill-fated part, of the past in Norway.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the cooler of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and murdered 77 people, among them men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of 22 July".
It is hard for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's present wealth there has been growth since the early 1970s of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as she goes through rakfisk trays and that, with her long blonde melancholy and amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
While everyone wasted money they didn't have during the years leading up to the financial crisis all over the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
"While we can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a boxed devolve.
I'm in the snow tailing for something to eat; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now a brand-new hamburger is definitely something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, he's coming back to that lousy fish.
The hotel where I am staying is one of the many locals where a rakfisk dinner is held in which comensians vote the best fish, or perhaps the most testing the nasal pits.
A TV has been connected live with a showman who is carrying a pajarita and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Harvard."
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While Mexico's incoming president, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, analyses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and that is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against drug trafficking that has already taken about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," explained Peña Nieto earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before coded with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populated state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which means a huge improvement compared to the paved roads and full of berries that have been rehabilitated.
You can also see plates with their name at the entrance of a modern multi-sport and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his political friend and ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, Member of the party of Peña Nieto, PRI.
"Particularly, with regard to security and economics, we expect the interesting and true change that our country so much needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was released by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations for Enrique Peña Nieto within the party.
It also rejects the qualification that the opposition lacks the essence of the new President.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic state man and, above all, he's a person who can hear."
However, on the other side of that state is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, military intervention was called for to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left out in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, that he did not know how to address the problem of feminicide while in charge.
The most critical accuse their administration of turning the eye upside down.
In a concrete house, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendia has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I came to his house, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned up," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that it had been beaten and the rigor of death had already appeared."
As her mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross where one word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like an old schmuck, a bully, a cheesecake.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shut up."
"But that can't be so when there have been so many irregularities and neglect," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope he's the same kind of president that he was when he was a governor," says PRI Olvera MP in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what families of the victims of Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, according to prosecutors
Prosecutors are trying to deal with allegations of Bradley Manning abuse during their stay in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period in Quantico's military prison in Virginia
Defence wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is charged with stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest filtration of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation conducted by the prosecution to Manning in a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Ashden Fein stated that the records of weekly visits by unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing carried out following the defence's request that the case be dismissed since its imprisonment had been hard and that it had already alleged enough punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is charged with stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks posted the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At the sight of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers filled after the visits to Manning during his arrest at the Quantico military prison, where he was in prison for maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning and noted their answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment given by the cells as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, even though the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had spoken about those problems and had indicated that they would be addressed, but that they had not made a record of those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidences' (after they talked about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I hadn't mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting in January 2011 with a council to examine the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months before.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "prevention of injuries" regime under which he was present.
The military said that they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is below the level of surveillance for possible suicide, in order to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the older state to know that I was okay and (I wanted to) stop being under injury prevention... in order to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the sea base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, that cage," Manning explained Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning stated that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a rink, some clothes and glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming out pointing to his eyes as he slept.
He said that if the concealers couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so he would turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal claim in January 2011 on the treatment he received Manning.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about a claim he had made in the Thursday statement that, after having been forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of the captors and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover with the blanket during the counting.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced by the order given to him by the concealer that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his chalclas to self-injure himself but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed their underwear, chalklaces and glasses from their cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted in the war council, which is expected to start early next year.
The defence stated that it plans to make Manning plead guilty of minor crimes and to defend other charges considered too extreme.
The view is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention are justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was retained in accordance with the rules of application for any detainees who are in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leaking information from national defence and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who have gone; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had hardly come down the explanation and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two tails: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Extrangers".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where to go.
When I grew up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" throughout my life.
It's about ethnic tachygraphy, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian."
I later decided to become Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, tachograph or scripts were not necessary.
He was just American.
I speak Spanish. Enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have a native's vocabulary level and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the foreign queue.
I thought at the time of this week that the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always the leaders of these two countries come together, it consisted of immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also hoping to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment a Mexican is so likely to stay in Mexico as he ventures to go to the United States.
It wants to be associated with the United States and Canada and to create in North America a trade block in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in half of its territory to gunpoint.
But for the Mexicans, who think of centuries, not minutes, the elements that remember it are everywhere.
So, at the moment when a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Moctezuma are set up in war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.
The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door to the opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this rock between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first know more strongly who they are and the second that bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered a part of the two countries.
In the meantime, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I've learned during my journey, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be alone with this idea, friends.
Fair enough.
If some Mexicans are still not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resented by the way their family members were treated a lot less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The fire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the futile and usual discussions about who first began, piles of buildings have been reduced to debris; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But despite the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left everything that they like or do not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional boom.
Maybe this makes your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their lethal state of death could disembark.
A war that doesn't lose or win
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the fire agreed on 21 November remains high, this week's clashes have strengthened the halcons of both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has suffered a good beating.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to stop Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining land in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders could conclude that time is in its favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renaissance regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas' joyful members say that the Islamic average moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbulá militia dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamic trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Above all in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas' cousins and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may appear as a protagonist to whom it cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
With regard to the military question, Hamas has been placed on its site.
The Israel Iron Dome system has shown its effectiveness and many of Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep calmer for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier that runs through the West Bank, the main piece of an aspirant territory to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that, according to international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud has joined an even harder line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the period prior to the elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why do you pamper these Palestinian riots by giving them a state of their own?
If they were truly ruling in the West Bank, wouldn't they shoot rockets as well as their compatriots in Gaza have done?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab spring might alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the zone will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire high is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two to three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push of people outside the conflict.
The solution continues to be the one with sensible people from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel ' s assignment of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the high fire gives a little more impetus to the people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to put a stop to the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote your attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases shine on boxes of a black-out, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with an envelopment of an olive green blackout, amazing images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies as children of smoking parents.
Except for the various health images and warnings, the only difference between the boxes, which have been mandatory since Saturday, is the names of the brands, all of which are printed in a small type of source.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
He trusts studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before age 26, there are 99% chances that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Pibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco the counterfeiters will bring from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Other people say that their business benefited from the bill.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone handkerchiefs and decks to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been fired almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law in the Australian Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was waiting for more stocks.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you sell tobacco and only you have this small window to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews of brands from "foot citizens" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It is worth asking whether it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what implies new regulation than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Pibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being implemented.
Many smokers in Australia are challenging.
"The photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"Take your cigarette and keep the pack," says Victor El Hage while buying a pack with the image of a tumor in your mouth.
"Unbelievably, there's only one reason why I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, the manager of the pond King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that the uniform boxes make it more difficult to place them on the shelves.
"It usually took an hour to disembowel a delivery; now I'm late four," says Yu.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it's, well, it's over and we're closing the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to bore a bit
During the Thanksgiving parties this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free stores.
But there are more and more academics and experts in child development praising the kindnesss of boredom.
According to them, it is good that we and our children get bored from time to time.
Borrowing forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept boredom in a good mood?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at Calgary University in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The Boring, a story animated") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompey there are graffiti in Latin about the boredom that dates back to the 1st century d.C.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and raising the idea to a discussion group consisting of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desire, but not able, to participate in an activity that fills you".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do anything but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly."
Boring can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, bored people tend to view the problem as a question of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider it to be a problem.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the next room a TV program at all volumes that kept no relationship, others heard it with the low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of care can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not to get bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or doing garabas, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"The research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to be quiet," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers in the 1980s developed a "scale of tendency to boredom".
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at West Florida University, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a type of group that is quite easily bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and his parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He found out that 32 percent of teenagers said he was bored while he was at school or doing his homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when he wasn't at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they'd get bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boring rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its higher rates," largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, going back to my first question: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into substance consumption as a method of combating it, as evidenced by research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"A boredom is the way your brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch television, you may be satisfied in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your son is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to shower," says Professor Fenske.
And "this ability to dose applies to other situations," he points out.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we should not be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of seeing, we need to be bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate to something worth it," she says.
It points out that what people really seek is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: without instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and football player in Southeast Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of a marijuana stone and a pipe that used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and later Orozco received a summons for the possession of drugs and related items (smaller crimes involving each one of the US$ 100 fines) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor cases due to drug possession depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of minor crimes by possession of marijuana are being cancelled here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
The police departments have ceased to present charges against those over 21 years of age for small-scale possession, which will be passed legally once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed themselves to moving forward with open cases of marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly authorized marijuana stores from being opened in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, right east of Denver.
Those in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the issue around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licences; all this before the deadline is reached, on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states with regard to the regulation of marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work.
"There is no true precedent that serves as a model for us," he says.
Washington law, known as I-502, comes into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but the possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide an "appropriate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis businesses in a radius of less than 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds, children's playgrounds or child centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, Aurora's chief of police, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would cease to bring court proceedings for minor misdemeanours for marijuana possession to people over 21 years of age and that the police would stop bringing charges against such crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said they would be responsible for enforcing the law of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers.
In the county of Weld, in the north of Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are faced with positions of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other positions.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal proceedings against those shortcomings that occurred at the time of the crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the Mesa rural county, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.
"I don't think he's wasting his time on keeping the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
Contradicting reactions throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials in relation to the great environmental experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier to district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the defendants for marijuana possession and who is the local spokesperson of the National Organization for the Reform of Marihuana Law.
"They've spent so much time taking people to the courts that they still can't accept that it's legal," he said.
By being the first states that consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become test cases at national level in terms of the legalization of drugs.
While state lawyers and officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some outstanding arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has made it possible for most of them to sell marijuana for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although it is likely that anti-drug agents will not pull down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will probably be reluctant to allow the operation of state-controlled stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a drug policy exaggerator of Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will pass about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious federal problem," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the county.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted against in favour of what the state voted."
There are many questions about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "I've been harassed to get rid of Oxford for being a Tory."
You don't attack university students because of their views just now
I don't remember any time in my life I haven't been dreaming about getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the career of History, he had already done the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father fell and wept.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper stated that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some college colleagues having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced that I had gone because I was forced to drink in unspoiled cups.
The truth was less fun.
I got out of there.
Yes, I did, because I had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because it came from a private school.
My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they wonder what that comes to now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-central students is undergoing similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of the students of the Conservative Party was such in Oxford that, last week, a group of students claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (grading student group) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people" by their political ideas.
They would like to establish a position on the Equal Opportunities Committee of their college to ensure that they can freely express their views.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC 2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, Brilliant and Right) on student policy and which presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative Party at Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with the silver grip.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as "Turkishheads" by the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20-year-old and vice-president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of leftrs in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old and history student in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old and elected president of the OUCA, says that the attitude of JCR members towards people who are on the right-hand side has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
For my first few weeks in Oxford, I was more lonely than one.
I went to university in September 1986, she was a very shy 18-year-old.
Hatred to the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The year before, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causative" after the cuts in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist amazed.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness I was expecting.
I found that not only did the cathedrals look fat in front of the fungus that was made of conservative colleges, but they were willing to participate in it.
The policy of the miners strike, the privatization and opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the wood chambers of the seminar.
The first one to attend was to translate 18th - century French texts into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Mr. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (yet dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
Don't say one.
Pitt, a low-headed man with a face that looked like a bizcocho mass, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Is that whatcherists refuse to learn French or is that they are simply fools?" he asked.
The other college students laughed.
I was burned at the eyes of the tears I was trying to hold.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you're not too busy to meet people," Pitt grunted.
I went back to my room like a soul in sorrow.
That night I sat alone at the time of dinner at the university; then I felt a slight slap on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of OAUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that's the way it's going.
They're messing with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even worse for you.
Many Tories have just come to appear to be laborist."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to dissimulate.
I insisted that you didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student in Philosophy, Politics and Economy who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" asked one.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me only after last night?
Should I become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I was expecting were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
He was hated not only by the Conservative party, but also by Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place why he considered it to be provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 she accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began to travel from Oxford daily to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my more open family and friends of metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it is the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would be broken if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminary in which another professor of History had insinuated, speaking entirely seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old men."
The truce lasted little time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career in Oxford.
By that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was in a row of fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they went, I packed the suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you'll call me weak lorone.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, who has not only formed 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party but, to this day, is hiding behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of the Costure", which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital to host an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this during the inauguration of "Valentine: Master of the Costure", a retrospective apotheosic that brings together more than 130 high sewing dresses created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "the lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rich and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3rd, private cards and photos are abundant with the signature of the most grenade of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social promotion: of humble modisto of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they don't put off the collars of their shots on your magnificent carpet as they do some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to their chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, playing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of modisto.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on its floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High Cost Week in 1995.
"Never goes by fashion because its designs are works of art," he concludes.
Alcurnia parade
Garavani's life is not a history of obsessions, but of well-matched love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the gateway to contemplate a dream "hearing" which lights Valentino's master works, as the dress he chose Jackie Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe that Monica Vitti used in "The Night", or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this mannequin audience there are names such as that of Sibilla in Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Mart in Norway, Rosario in Bulgaria or Sofia in Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and Modest in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "not able to forget."
I remember him perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" jacket and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that he made me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love to women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors you use, they have great light and they are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion writer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtamaco can't forget the first time she saw a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting to have the age and the opportunity to wear one of her night costumes...
Finally came the time in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flying skirts, "corsage" flagged and hear the word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashion party dresses with "the greatest care... because a dress is not only a dress, it's also the set of memories she carries."
The "king" of fashion
The grand end of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding costume with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girlzzes" (as the modist calls their seams) to develop this ivory silk suit with pearl incrustations, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in the high seam of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of high society".
Obblished for years with the "know-being" of the elite, now Valentino is his best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of its clients' husbands.
"He has always called me attention to his refinement, his calmness, his clean and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of the Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time does not pass to him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers play life and health carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another that literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this, you have to go down every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth is solidified when you come into contact with the air.
After stripping large sulphur rocks, which total weigh about 70 kilos, it carries them in two bamboo baskets that carry on their shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausting carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb through the turtle, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps not to slip and fall by the cliff.
They know that any transpire could cost them their lives, as a French tourist who spent years at Kawah Ijen's risk.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur they extract
Once above, they pass among tourists photographing them as circus monkeys and, carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little further, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make waxes, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As normal is to charge 70 kilos, we pull some 46,000 rupees (€3.8) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily doors.
It takes three hours each and ends up wet, but allows you to add 18,000 rupees (11,5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what would win in the field.
"The miners' newspaper is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid at 15,000 rupees (€1.2 euros) on the day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (€167) " , clarify the carrier, who used to work as a butcher on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and the coffin was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a weight reason which, in Indonesia, is as striking as the sulphur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to become Islam."
Then he has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass her bill despite covering her face with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in English more than acceptable.
Punished by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waitress or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, it rises every day at two in the morning because the sulphur does not cease to eat at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater, dawning with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers carry the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and both the weight.
In fact, they don't even see part of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) charge per camera which, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (€1.2), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for the animals and not for the people," protest Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
Capable of raising up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will endure to work "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulphur burns the throat and hides the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases ... further, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, kneeaches and ankles, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
By rocking the basket over its back, Unainik can now only carry 50 kilos to its 53 years.
Each day, he and his companions take 15 tons of sulphur to the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamasari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat path between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims opening his mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works carrying sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the harshest trades in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and cost of property and education for not having children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unbelievable that these verses are part of an ad of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video turned viral on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bay (bollo) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, holds the hope that with the ad they can draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music so people would do their "national duty".
This is something purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing evenings of quick dates (speed-dating).
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
What is not taken so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1.300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and their strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently in 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as a replacement rate - was 1976.
So why don't Singaporeers have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, says that it is due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in singleness, and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration to address the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia is barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not being integrated.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling in the birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government tries not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have 46-square-meter surfaces and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the El Developers real estate company, says that his "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than the largest units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units wear out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers, to whom it used to be blocked if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a State city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeers working in the financial district of the center seems to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man about 20 years old.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of property and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
The private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private or "the scope of private life that is entitled to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply to your daily life and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers that you are exposed to venting out situations on the Internet that you probably wouldn't be sharing off-line?
The Journal interviewed five boys between 10 and 15 years old, frequent network users.
In four of the cases, they associated the term to "something very mine", on the personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not upload them to a post," says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been held accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everybody," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I'm also having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that isn't mine, or someone who's making the joke," she says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures to meet the 35 friends he has in FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just raise them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertained, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
There is no doubt that he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even mind someone recommending a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter it admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his home or his phone number.
"If I'd been pressured or demanded by them, I'd just take them out of my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not outside the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine's acquaintance was extorting him into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"I never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to José, didn't close the bill.
"Just put her privacy."
Then explain a number of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
If I did, I'd get hurt or I'd like it.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet arose as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, master in Pedagogy by Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We're the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we're still learning," she says.
It comments that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to spread, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for that."
"They are also selective when what they care most about is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents privacy is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do so does not serve," he adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
You know what others publish about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, do you all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they have to act on line as they do off line.
They're the same rules.
"One out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it must be on social media," he says.
Monitoring
Student Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential for family parents to read social media policies to an awareness.
Understanding each of the incisos they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," she says.
According to Guardia, it is vital to remind children of the lesson of "do not speak with strangers."
Ends Unasur Summit without making public the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically subscribed by the seven assistant delegates.
Effect repeatedly attempted to access the signed document at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Chancellor and Presidency noted at a start that would deliver it after the closure, but then stated that it would be published at some point on the Peruvian Government website.
Having been consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a few brief statements to the press.
Access by journalists to the Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the appointment, although not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is the statement by Humala, not the official document that closed the summit.
In October last, Peru was the host of the Third Arab Summit of South American Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite its insistent demands from the press, neither was the so-called Lima Declaration issued previously.
On the official ASPA website it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that there were secured transmission systems for all journalists, but that information was limited to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Court of The Hague which sets out a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they would respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations from both sides, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will act and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are taking to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean pair.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, along with the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that the ICJ will be submitted to occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Covenant of Bogota for which he had agreed to submit to the judgements of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that he considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the insistence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after the noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document reporting that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investment.
The agreements adopted included that UNASUR countries will "take important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residency agreements".
It reported that action is being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-priced internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphal matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and to visualize a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas, bringing our countries together and generating new economic circuits," said the president of Peru in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and they are located on the transversal axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to re-integrate the Union of South American Nations", of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations among neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional appointment he hoped to meet with his partner from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute in a respectful manner after a decision by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"The morning (Saturday) may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We're going to check all these paths, they're not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell you that we handle this in the most civilised and respectful way possible," said Santos.
Santos and Ortega will be found on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the defence ministers of the block met in advance to adopt the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal where "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a country".
In that regard, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship that encourages the Unasur member countries.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also expressed support for the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give a chair never commit to anything, and instead we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," said Ecuador's founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa affirmed that he is not sorry for that decision because it has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process would not be respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that the interrogation be submitted to his territory for a alleged sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out through videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said Ecuadorian deputy.
What is true is the danger of deteriorating physical and mental health by being locked up in a small space without being able to perform outdoor exercises.
"That complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the granting of a lifeline to allow him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there had been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is making a number of procedures at different European bodies," he said.
And he believed that "if Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this ends."
And if Sweden, as it perfectly permits its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him via Skype tomorrow this problem ends.
Correa took advantage to reaffirm himself as a press freedom defender and nuanced that what it does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, it was pleased that these journalists are no longer "not the bankers nor the bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and it went on to be re-elected "will spread into the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto in Paraguay in Unasur until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and couppism clothed with legality" because it actually "destructed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered, "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not addressed.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed in a broad way to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the dispute by sea limits that maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and believed that "it is right for Latin America to seek international authorities if the two countries undertake to accept any judgement as hard as it may be".
With reference to the eventuality of candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard."
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 beginnings, he will withdraw from public life.
I have never been personally interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement thought it was me who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsiveness," he said.
Winning would be my last period in the presidency and from there we came out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan vice president Nicolás Maduro and told me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that he expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in President Chavez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of State today participated in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Deaths by AIDS today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if I dropped a bomb," he said, recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "more smooth", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients in the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was bringing a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least in the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after reporting that this information was evaluated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system that patients present at the start of diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years, when reporting 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25, under these terms "while remaining in control may live without problems until the age of 75," the interviewer explained.
To scale this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, with 187 deaths until May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't had enough medication the problem is that patients get very advanced because they don't know their condition of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He said: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection what they have to do to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make more early diagnoses and, therefore, they have to offer massive detection tests to all those who require it."
Specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida) coincide with their own patients, such as Fabrizio, who went to test at a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had made it a friend and, despite his short age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die by now, I'd better come back three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the drugs.
To date, her parents only know she suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I travel, I have an active, but responsible sexual life, I care for myself and the other person," Fabrizio listed, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, within the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Tests are made, if they were at risk, that in the near future they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live as anyone, being responsible.
That, your message, summarizes the battle slogan to AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Great are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, supported Ricardo Salazar, a Tapapé journalist who has assumed the cause about HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task, "there has indeed been an increase in the split of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packs of 100, and that is very good, but it turns out that there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with a smile and valuable judgements of social workers, school guidance, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents are not exposed, assured the communicator.
I propose to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be behind the exhibitors and those hundred are found in public bathroom dispatchers of the sites that young people frequent.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
It's not about paying for the scaffolds and motels, as Governor Emilio González replied, when he asked whether he would have distributed condoms in his administration.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to approach condoms to those who already engage in sexual activity," he pointed out.
Jalisco Keys
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the contagions correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. Appellate Court of Appeal that ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial contract in Mexico, the scenario sets a disastrous precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures for survival of signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, in contravention of international agreements.
In the practical field, the backbone of the sentence issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankrupt Court for the North Texas District leaves defenseless to Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties in alleging the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to attend the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
At the entrance, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the trade competition dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would be to ignore international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, for that purpose, the United Nations Model Law on Uniform International Trade Law was created, placing the American Law Institute as referee.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the intercompanies vote, recognized in the critical mass of the trade competition, the debts that had with their mother the subsidiaries of Vitro, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, it is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-companies owed the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
In addition, the remaining votes of the subsidiaries, however, the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States Courts, that is, the "good" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The Court of Appeals has omitted the data.
From another angle, it blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 on the basis of the severe economic crisis that he faced in the United States, pasting the country's collection.
Soon, the signing of the González Sada family will appeal to the appellate tribunal itself for the vote to be taken at its plenary, i.e. the five judges, since they only voted three.
Failure to prosper will call for the remedy of Cerciore that requires the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The grave fact is that the court filed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the form of friendly curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competition Act, noting that the court was defused with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to match it with chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: take Vitro and hit the country.
General balance
For several months the complaints put on the table by the Mexican Aviation Unions against the exduan of the company, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Pilots Aviadores already found the bottleneck.
The instance led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Values Commission that is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the Supervisory Authority has consistently refused to report to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from Banco IXE’s trust F/589, on behalf of Mexican Aviation, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to purchase shares from the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're looking for the Dragon Mars.
Gathered on the weekend in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal shopping and distribution centre for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
The Canacintra had previously succeeded in unifying the governors of the south-east zone to oppose the monumental coso that torn apart part of protected areas and raised the mother of all the amagos against the industry.
ACTA Died
Soslayed by the government a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Commercial Agreement, known for its English acronyms as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, action was given despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social media.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the Homex housing developer is placing on the market Bursatile Certificates for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical ones that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitive Birth
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders of information technology, has just been born a consortium with competitive social reason, whose goal will be the service market for software clusters in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Kings: "The basketball has been my life"
Trotamundos of the basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years connected to the board sport and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And it's just that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, he was a minor player, a national superior basketball player, taken over and leading at the BSN with the Bayamón Vacceros or president of the Balkan Federation.
"I put many hats in the basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a first hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of your house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote your extensive journey, so witness it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, those who treasure with greater emotion are the ones who remember their passage through the Cows from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he reached 15 years of age as a co-powered or taken over by the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones that I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight cowboy championships since 1967, as well as as as being taken over, co-powered or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I fired with one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
From then on "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had run here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a very strong player, 6"7" of height.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartow then recommended to sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Cowboys' Championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at the distance, as by 1988 it was already a federative mandam.
For that time I would prefer to enjoy his executives and Mincy's in the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the Pre-Employment in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth place and it must have been bronze not to be for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Kinges said.
Is this 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave it to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze in the world.
This team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, to the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and to Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and great joy was the 1995 Prelympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner in place of the players suspended by the Pan American League of the Sea of Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt that was Piculin Ortiz.
Its numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't count his trajectory on the different leagues he played.
Who was the best bulge leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
It was part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and at the beginning of the 90, the National Team had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you have to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the Island in national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessary.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, desk officers and referees.
That's my pleasure.
What are you doing now?
All I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Kill actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, best known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a man of unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative business.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., home producing "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her audience, Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
It was creative, generous, fun, funny, caring and talented, and I'm going to miss it a lot.
"He was an original person and lived his life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that were little time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included roles well received by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his greatest star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in betting houses.
It also helped give the series a record of audiences at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and converted to "Dallas" in the second most visible entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with hooking up as a prostitute unless she was out of town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be hospitalized.
"I know what I want at the J.R. tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here's the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiation he lost.
Victoria Principal, a co-protagonist of the original series, recalled Friday to Hagman as someone "great, inside and outside the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we were lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and one sixth was in progress, the chain reported.
There was not immediately a statement by Warner or TNT about how the series will handle the loss of Hagman.
Originating from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who stelarized classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage to counsel Ben Hagman.
He was lucky at the New York theaters in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While I was there, she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought I was going to hurt someone or affect them somehow," said the Associate Press at the time.
After liver transplantation he became a organ donor promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to assist fearsome patients.
"I advise them, I value them, I meet them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "no aku, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they're gonna be okay."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
They start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor in religion Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible anchor: The end of the "long regression account" of the Maya Calendar, on 21 December, to which many people have been held as a proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he was expecting in the next couple of months: The hurricane cataclysmic Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "dedarmagedion" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of the times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been," Charmé said this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good time.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate with time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could explode a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option of giving the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "minent ruin", students should study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"He got tired in two hours," Restall said about his student course on an average high, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who wondered if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less one teacher - said to believe on the date of expiry of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and we somehow discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior student at the Temple, 21-year-old and West Chester.
Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back to several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about a course on "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, implying an exception from a higher authority.
We have a Pope's pardon.
Restal noted that many days of the final judgment have been spoken over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people will begin to think immediately on the next day" or to philosophy that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they're going to "the end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I call some friends to laugh together," said 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
