Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronovirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronovirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
According to the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a small number of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a home of unknown ethiology pneumonia was reported to Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronovirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with VOCID-19 have a benign condition, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which heal.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 causes a more severe attack requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a severe form of disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom (U.S.), and compare it with the developments in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and United Kingdom countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 edition of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (U.S.) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtaining cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of cases of VOCID-19 reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA and the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020 at 8.00 p.m. with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of the COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom
The 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom generally followed that in the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom presented a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom compared to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that, at 15 March at 8.00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 increases rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progress at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in national public health services responses, potential variations in case definitions, as well as differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up tests.
In early March 2020, physicians in affected regions in Italy indicated that approximately 10% of patients with VOCID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not submitted).
However, systematic collection is necessary to complement current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study carried out in 2010–11 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care for 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios related to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalised VOCID-19 cases associated with a risk > 90% of overcapacity in beds in intensive care, are provided in the sixth update of the ECCM's rapid risk assessment relative to VOCID-19.
Given that the cases were up to date grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally receive a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should, preferably, be established at level 2 of the Statistical Territorial Unit Nomenclature (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly moving in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare themselves for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with VOCID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care, as well as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent early risk assessment of the CPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential for delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2, from an approach to a mitigation approach, to the extent that the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window in which each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Without this, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the days or weeks to come.
The disease epidemic with coronovirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronovirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infection in China and elsewhere, causing a humanitarian disaster.
As its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which led to thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, VOCID-19 presents less severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this subject of growing research.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, ethiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will contribute to better understanding and eradication of this serious illness.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, has forever marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain closed for the entire golden week as well as for other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronovirus (CoV) that causes an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; that is why it was baptized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease called coronovirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan and spread rapidly to all of China before reaching almost 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of VOCID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the public enemy number one", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works have been published on VOCID-19, including in the fields of virology, epidemiology, ethiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 with the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this new subject in full growth.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronovirus disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and we will address some still outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-mortal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common rhymes 4.
However, during this century, we have had two highly pathogenic coronary coronaviruses for humans, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before rapidly spreading to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The present COVID-19 is therefore the third coronovirus epidemic in recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1.1, pneumonia foyers of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronovirus sequence was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with the interruption of all its public transports.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of the infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO qualified the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of writing this report, the disease had already spread to all of China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
To the extent that the situation changes rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COPID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very little less than 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
VOCID-19 developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and on the outskirts.
The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of VOCID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-72).
The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincided with the massive displacements that took place prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
The coronavirus is a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a simple bree RNA.
They can be classified into four genres: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, the coronavirus known to infect the human belonging to the alpha and beta genres.
Glycoprotein Spike (S) of the envelope is related to the conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and to dipeptidel peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
Viral RNA genome is released into cytoplasm; after replication of viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vesicles containing virion, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betachoronavirus, with more than 99.98% of genetic identity between 10 sequenced samples taken from the outbreak site, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using electronic transmission microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-fine sections of human epithelium of the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a lower infection than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein coded by the orf3b as well as a secret protein coded by the orf8.
The ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the ORF8 does not contain known functional areas or motives.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 to a resolution of 2.9 and in complex with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for the screening of drugs to eliminate the infection with SARS-CoV-2.
The home host and the intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were derived from bats and were transmitted to Man via civets and chamelades, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who has allowed the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect Man remains unknown, and the transmission route is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., gave rise to the assumption that the virus could have been transmitted bats to humans by snakes, which would imply a homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers from Guangzhou, in China, the pangolin - a long-sweet mammal feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by 99% genetic homology between a kronovirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % gap between two genomes is a difference in importance and therefore it is necessary to expect conclusive results to establish concrete evidence (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may well have similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally free of immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the immune system inherent to it through molecular motif recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
By different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humorous immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a re-established patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction from the immune system results in a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can result in severe lung injury and other organs and, in the worst scenario, multi-viscral failure, even death.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by an outbreak in the home, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally than 3 to 7 days after a study of the first 425 cases reported to Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days for a range ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded at an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) after a demography of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of quarantine after as accurate incubation as possible, in order to avoid the transmission of the virus by infected but asymptomatic individuals.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of VOCID-19, and may be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, thoracic pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the disease occurred.
Regarding severe cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as patients with acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnea and 3% diarrhea, and 8% of patients needed ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported by two recent studies on a family and home following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with SRMS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% needed ventilatory assistance, much more so than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with higher lethality of the SRSM compared with the SVOID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with SRMS.
With regard to SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat pain (13%-25%), and ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2%, for 66,576 globally confirmed cases.
Comparably, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) at 95% of 5.71-7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 was only from 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to propagate than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but that it is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than it was for the epidemics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients restored may again be carriers of the virus, which emphasizes the need to increase quarantine duration.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L and a high rate of aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had high levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the D-dimera rate, a fibrin degradation product in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
thoracic X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral shadows or a depolitic glass opacity at the lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In case of ADRS, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of liquid and progressive fibrosis seriously compromises gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in the surfactant rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying thoracic examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a pneumocytes dequamation, the formation of hyalin membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a deceased patient of the disease, which coincides with viral infection pathology and SDRA and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
SARS-CoV-2 ARN detection via a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as a primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for the diagnosis (which was no longer based on the RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive band in less than one hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practice if it is used on clinical specimens.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support to patients with COVID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, restore patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients was proposed for treatment.
All pharmaceutical companies are working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OCC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivative technique used for the treatment of critical heart or respiratory impairments.
Furthermore, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting vital organ functions, are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune system reaction has been shown to cause cytokinic shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ADR and multi-visceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially for severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include modulation of the T-cell immune response, blocking of cytokines IFN-, IL-1 and TNF, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 signaling suppressor, and ADAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking high-dose steroids did not have a beneficial effect on severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would have serious side effects, including an avascular osteonecrosis, which would significantly affect the prognosis.
However, careful use of low to moderate-dose corticosteroid short cycles has been recommended for patients with severe VOCID-19.
At the time of writing this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, proved effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, redesivir has also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other viruses to simple bream RNA, including the MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead sent the compound to China to enable a number of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir association and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury and other side effects may occur as a result of combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma restored patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from it is an ancestral practice.
Patients recovered often have a relatively high rate of antibodies to the pathogen.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
In this way, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who cured COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms have improved in 24 hours, in combination with a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to be able to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
In view of the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies may cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which is potentially fatal.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat severely ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from restored patients and to identify genetic codes coding relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would make it possible to rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the absence of a specific effective treatment of COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease remission symptoms.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest cure rates for COVID-19 were observed in China's provinces using TCM for 87% of patients, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which had only used up to 30% of patients with COVID-19, has the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison, since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be considered for the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study that compared treatment using Western Medicine (MO) only and combined treatment associated with MO and MTC.
It was found that the return time to normal body temperature, the withdrawal time of symptoms, and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the rate of aggravation of symptoms (light to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% to 46.2%); mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM remains to be clarified through more-scale controlled tests and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of VOCID-19 are generally very concerned about this highly contagious and fatal disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric disorders have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crises, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact search and quarantine, in response to the public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt among the sick with regard to the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to patients with VOCID-19, to individuals identified as likely cases, to people in contact with these populations, and to any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support must include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission chain of animal and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity from SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these potential vaccines in the elderly and on models subject to lethal provocation and their protection against an infection with a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, since no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and homes of MERS continue to be reported in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for the MERS using the inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective for monitoring the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the important period (18 months on average) needed to develop a dynamic coronovirus vaccine and variations.
To the extent that this is an emerging disease, the COVID-19 starts its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a model of prediction is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to date, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SARS prognosis, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
VOCID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% over 50 according to a study conducted on 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age of 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with VOCID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive cholangiocytes of ACE2, which may lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a potential predictor of disease, treatment response and healing.
The correlation between the CPR rate and severity as well as the COVID-19 prognosis was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also be involved in establishing the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially at the heart and liver level, and are released in case of tissue lesions.
Therefore, they traditionally constitute markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of VOCID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in addition treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high dose corticosteroids were widely used in severe cases of SARS, many survivors experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with VOCID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the VOCID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, patients often suffering from long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty as well as the death of close or other patients.
It is imperative to offer long-term psychological support and support to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, VOVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause or induce symptoms in the first phase of the infection, like coronaviruses at the origin of common rhymes.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly hinders the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current epidemic of COVID-19 is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than that of SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continuing quarantine of almost all the population with a view to interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as on other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the phase of decline will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believes that the COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than the SARS, will not be extinguished by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the removals of the average nasal cornet and the throat of patients restored, 2 weeks after their exit from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the progressive decrease in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial estimates, Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was eventually controlled.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectiousness to eventually extinguish or evolve into a less pathogenic virus that coexists with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig.
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough or sneezing, and also possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in seals, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
It is therefore appropriate to take precautionary measures to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even anyone who might be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the wearing of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) participates in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they could be passed on to others.
However, only masks N95 (1860) provide protection against inhalation of virions of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to penetrate completely; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the larger SARS-CoV, since both measure approximately 85 nm.
Since particles manage to cross five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients carry N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals need to wear adjusted isolation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor turned out to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus might have entered his body through the eye because of an inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals must also wear transparent visas or protective glasses to contact patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfecting soap more often than usual, to remain confined to maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high alert status after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Centre reassured the population that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited interhuman transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable release, especially at the time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from them and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official organizations; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) perform more targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of the population about epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve the society's response system on a regular basis.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to all of China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of VOCID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the epidemic of VOCID-19 is emerging as an impression of already vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
VOCID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SARS presents a higher mortality rate than that of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
The transmission of the VOCID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by severely ill patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of VOCID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 ARN detection tests may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, restored patients may be again positive to the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of propagation.
Despite rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronoviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to confirm that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from chiroptera.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the original host virus, for example bats, to Man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt the transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to the ACE2, but how does the virus enter exactly into the respiratory cells and how does it result in pathological changes?
Is the virus also related to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a prompt and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all these and many other questions.
However, regardless of the expenses that this must lead us, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only few immunodepressed patients experienced severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Apart from the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could generate approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period between 4 and 7 days, the peak viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially exhibit myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false liver function tests and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in case of suspected SARS.
Common alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which can be fatal especially in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to research on HCOV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunodepressed patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of this same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old male with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he was identified in the Netherlands, he is actually present worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laryngitis, also called a crop.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old hospitalised man due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to communicate effectively and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of the SRS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by an evolving acute pneumonia.
Contrary to SARS, many patients suffering from MRS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MRS in relation to HCOV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories were reported with a high death rate, 34.4%, making MERS-COV one of the most known human viruses.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 were reported and could contribute to its rapid spread in the world.
Comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCOVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCOVs (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of VOCID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in sample samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and its sustainable distribution after transmission to humans, will have an influence on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCOVs that cause moderate symptoms have adapted well to man.
In other words, both could be the survivors of HCoV's previous pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must be replicated in humans in sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate the host's restraining factors.
In this perspective, the more the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 persists and the more people infected are important, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by 40 or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired COVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple rhyme in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require animal reservoirs.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are highly pathogens, have not adequately adapted to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and propagate in their zoonotic tanks and seek an opportunity to achieve potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs acquired in community.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired and less pathogenic HCOV than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without an animal reserve or intermediate host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, we will be very helpful in discussing the definitions and characteristics of the changing, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of a HCoV if it is home to a close ascendant sharing a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The original virus has often been well adapted and is not pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a tank host houses HCoV in a continuous and long-term manner.
On the other hand, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural tank host.
In particular, given that 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also serve as an amplifier intermediate host cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive to the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the basis for a new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
The converting enzyme of human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reserve host of SARS-CoV.
That is why bats cannot be the middle reserve host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromadairs were seropositive to specific antibodies neutralizing the MERS-CoV, as well as camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only by the respiratory tract, but also by the feces, which also constitutes the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than the distance between the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-CoVs.
Scientists remain divided into the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could both be derived from bat coV, while the parent viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed the barrier of species to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of bat-suris near HCoV-229E were found.
First, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the alpagas.
Then, the alpaga-Alpha-CoV-Suris related to HCoV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in bat-Suris, while the alpaga-Alpha-COV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaga alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In reality, bats are the direct source of human pathogen viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCOV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while bat-suris alpha-CoV is used as a genetic reservoir of HCoV-229E, alpagas and dromadairs could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-COV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to human dromadares and dromadares.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known by its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromadares for decades.
It has been well adapted to these chameleons that have moved from intermediate host to stable natural reservoirs.
Contrary to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, the beta-coV of the pangolin are highly pathogenic in the pangolins.
Several inter-species transmission possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through the crackling or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by cutting and consuming game meat.
Many mammals including domestic animals may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place within a third species having been in contact with bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-line RNA viruses, estimated VOC mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per site per year, depending on the COV adaptation phase for new hosts.
Nevertheless, the rate of mutation of the CoVs is about a million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well adapted to dromadairs.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals ineffective in the short term against SARS-CoV-2.
Third, the VOCs change randomly and frequently as a model when replication of the NRA through a unique "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as for the COV observed in the animal, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Huge virus interaction related to transmission
Beyond these three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receiver as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryptoscopy study indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times greater than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, the HCOV-NL63 also binds to the ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural HCoV tank hosts, such as bats, dromadares and rodents, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
Emergence of new HCoVs: Return to check-out
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many emerging opportunities for new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCVs.
Among the accessories proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, since the SRS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they codified divergent ORF8 proteins.
This deletion splits the ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is felt to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of host.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic of MERS-CoV has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which have occurred in dromadairs in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaga alpha-CoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a deviation from the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by selective pressure exerted in their reserve hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected by CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats were well adapted to the Anatomical and Physiological VOCs.
For example, anomalies in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the high level of reactive derivatives of oxygen (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of COV and affect the "recollection" by exoribonucléase, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts, such as bats and camels.
They respond strongly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes severe human infection are found.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions are.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was cut off from the replication of the VOC.
The same immune response disassociation strategy could have a beneficial effect on the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
For example, administration of type I interferon in at least the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Based on this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with CCM950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a mouse-bore beta-coV that shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a bat-coV that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Remarkably similar beta-CoV of the pangolin to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the beta-CoV of the pangolin could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The VOCs returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromadarian for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camel, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, the zoonotic potential of which is very high.
The culture of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Actually, there have been many viruses on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural tanks until there is a chance of contagion.
Continued surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from ecological niches of natural zoonoses tanks.
First, if bats transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, the SARS-CoV-2 or the near-identic parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example by omitting to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of hand-washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterial, virus or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronovirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during births at home.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as handwashing in soap.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which accounts for nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Washing hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deletion, frequent handwashing can weaken the skin by causing skin desiccation.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive handwashing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly frequent among health workers.
Too common handwashing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (CTO).
Deparasitation twice a year, associated with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic soils, are difficult to solve in the water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants allows to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, although antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the active and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary sanos were as effective as antibacterial sanos intended for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of warm water did not help to reduce microbial burden on the hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thick agent such as carbon (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or to a moisturizer such as glycerine to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the absorbing effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide reinforces the antimicrobial activity. hand disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their quick disposal activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may result in skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by moisturizers and/or moisturizers of the skin.
The effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, as they remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hands disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and the formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas using benzalkonium chloride presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after the application, unlike alcohol, which is mitigated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
What is more, if the soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it is likely to increase the spread of diseases rather than stop it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wash your hands with cold or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Swallow a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action of friction creates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and to fry longer to remove more germs.
Rinse enough in running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant watershed can result in hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or free air.
Wet and wet hands can easily reconnect.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and nail polish can accommodate microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin injury that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, to make water flow from a suspended or perennial cane and/or to use as hot as necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as typy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging hook using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers often found in the toilets.
After the washing and drying of hands in hot-air hand dryers, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased on average 194% on the thumb pulp and 254% on the palms.
Dry-drying with jettisoning resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the thumb of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand-drying, the following changes in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers were compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical washing of hands must last for at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to bite and fry each part of the hands.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by walking between fingers.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The objective of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogens ("growths") and avoid transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewels must be removed.
Under this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should be prevented from flowing to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite economic options to build hand washing stations.
Nevertheless, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can switch from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations may be part of the hand hygiene campaigns that are carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
The World Day of Handwashing is another example of awareness-raising campaign that claims to promote behavioural development.Following the coronovirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji depicting handwashing.
However, one review suggests that the promotion of soap-washing is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmes.
For example, in Germany, posters showing "good handwashing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The expression "washing hands" refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash their hands before and after each meal.

Because it's the flu season.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in the genomes of viruses, which are very likely to result from the pressures exerted during the selection, especially by the host's immune system.
For example, the complete ORF4 loss in the HCoV-229E prototype strain can be cited as a result of a two-nucleotide deletion.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaga alpha-CoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a deviation from the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by selective pressure exerted in their reserve hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected by CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats were well adapted to the Anatomical and Physiological VOCs.
For example, anomalies in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the activity of natural kill cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural kill cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of the molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive derivatives of oxygen (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of COV and affect the "recollection" by exoribonucléase, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts, such as bats and camels.
They respond strongly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes severe human infection are found.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions are.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was cut off from the replication of the VOC.
The same immune response disassociation strategy could have a beneficial effect on the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
For example, administration of type I interferon in at least the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Based on this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with CCM950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a mouse-bore beta-coV that shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a bat-coV that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals in the markets were discovered as carriers of viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 was identified.
Remarkably similar beta-CoV of the pangolin to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the beta-CoV of the pangolin could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While issues remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
The VOCs returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of VOCs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of VOCs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and on-market claws, the closure of fresh product markets and the slaughter of the on-site claws could have effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the markets for fresh products to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, taking into account the discovery of many narrowly related lines of beta-CoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the studies to follow.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromadarian for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camel, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, the zoonotic potential of which is very high.
There is no shortage of opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombinate, causing the emergence of new, more communicable and/or mortal CoVs in humans in the future.
The culture of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan of preparation and intervention should be put in place.
Actually, there have been many viruses on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural tanks until there is a chance of contagion.
Although bats have many positive characteristics for the spread of viruses, the likelihood for humans to be in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away from them.
Continued surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from ecological niches of natural zoonoses tanks.
Not all secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, the SARS-CoV-2 or the near-identic parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will clarify the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of VOCID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive on the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronovirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge are gradually progressing on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 (seventh version) diagnostic and treatment directives published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronovirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called severe acute respiratory syndrome at coronovirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
She has received a lot of attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are progressing slowly on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) has had seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which were substantially modified.
Our directive received a comment from Zhou et al., the latter presented a simple assessment proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We support their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated in accordance with the latest ICVOID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Version Test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case must associate one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to form a complete analysis, or correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) an history of contact with a confirmed cluster of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in the space of 2 weeks in a reduced area such as home, office, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count as early as symptoms begin.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the whole viral genome with strong homogeneity with known new coronaviruses; (3) positive serum testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; or modification of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increased title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogen testing of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); the serum evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of respiratory pathways including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive outcome of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
Moreover, increasing evidence reminds us of caution regarding atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified persons with no clinical symptoms as "low-risk".
The evaluation system must also be checked in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to pass on their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and comply with the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive on time to offer its help.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country thus records a death record due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladeshi Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (IDRC) reported that the number of registered contaminated persons included 114 active cases and 33 healed persons, who remained confined to home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport started on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transportation of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always allowed.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded the million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, extended the city's confinement until May 1st.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the 15-day national state of emergency; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronoviruses
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal an infection with HCV could be.
Most HCOVs come from bats where they are not pathogens.
The intermediate reserve hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identification of host animals has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Studying the CoV-host interactions in animals could also help to better understand the CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, the VOCs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV).The genus Bêta-CoV contains the majority of the VOCs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCOV) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracing of the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the driving forces and the restrictive factors of crossing the barrier of species.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the storage, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the prevention of future contagions.
The CoV animals have been known since the end of the 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCOVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was then adapted to grow in the pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headaches, sneezing, malaises and throat pain, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present throughout the world and appear to be mainly broadcast in winter, in temperate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce the limits of toilet paper by purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evenings Australian Woolworths and Coles store chains have reduced their restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to two and a package per purchase at all stores at the national level, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the caisses and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently collected reservations because of the fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to a package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of 8 March, stated that, with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in stockbreak within the hour after delivery," and qualified the demand for "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales experienced a "strong increase" last week, according to a spokesperson from Woolworths.
The Costco Store in Canberra also restricted the quantity allowed to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a planned promotion Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on delivery times by truck make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers are trying to meet demand, and less promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early stock deployment, some stores are unable to honor the promotion of Wednesday.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a distribution expert at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores refuel stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in stocks of a small amount that, once exhausted, leave large areas empty in rays, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if such products as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic," explained Russell Zimmerman at ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were in stock breaking.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper that manufactures Sorbent paper, pointed out that they work 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, said that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first buyer at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because the buyers were on leave during the long weekend of the Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page poster intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, in which they announced that they did not provide for the introduction of purchasing restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday night that the UK online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization identifies the pandemic VOCID-19
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current epidemic as COVID-19 (the disease caused by the pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2).
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, not to the danger of specific cases, the WHO indicated the need to move governments to action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries test, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
"We are deeply concerned, not only at alarming levels of propagation and gravity, but also at alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
He stated, in statements published by CNN in February, that "in addition to the flu, no other respiratory viruses have been observed since its appearance until its continued worldwide spread."
Ghebreyus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
To this he added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the epidemic an international emergency of public health.
The director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "To be brief, the situation will get worse."
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The coronovirus pandemic of 2019-20 has been an ongoing coronovirus disease epidemic since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute choronovirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364 000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Current symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include acute respiratory distress pneumonia and syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, and monitoring and confining suspected people to be infected.
The authorities of the world have responded by setting up restrictions on travel, quarantine, fire cover, risk controls on workplaces and closures of establishments.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic disturbances, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has circulated over the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of Asian origin and appearance in East and South-East Asia, as well as against other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a home of unknown cause pneumonia cases on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to Huananan's seafood wholesale market and therefore it is believed that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered and closely related virus to the coronovirus of bats-suris, pangolins coronovirus, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was found that the first known person with symptoms fell ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no obvious link to the subsequent home of the fresh product market.
In the cases of the first home reported in December 2019, the two-thirds proved to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unaudited report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case might rise on 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old from the province of Hubei. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases appeared to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with benign symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and less representing 2.4 per cent of the world's cases. UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60 per cent of the British population should be infected before they could achieve effective collective immunity.
Cases indicate the number of persons tested at COVID-19, and the test has been confirmed to be positive according to official protocols.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had had as their official policies not to test those who presented only benign symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that 86 per cent of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated in China until 23 January, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79 per cent of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people suffering from COVID-19 heal.
For those who do not heal, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to VOCID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, approximately 80% of deaths were more than 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official counts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who died who had been tested positive to the COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, since it might not include non-tested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the numbers of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of the deaths of COVID.
A spokesperson from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the sub-assessment in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza epidemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, out of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the onset of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-decade report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global case-decade report is 6.0 per cent (9739/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the death-related report decreased by 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurring between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that occurred after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the lethality rate (letality rates), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who succumb to a disease, and the infection rate (infection rates), which represents the percentage of contaminated (diagnostic and non-diagnosed) that succumb to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the infection rate for the pandemic in its overallity is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomised tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on lethality estimates.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said: "Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to recede when the disease is lacking in available guests.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when it will happen.”
Chief Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government Zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be completed by June" if all countries were able to mobilize to follow WHO's recommendations on measures to curb the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine declared that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to a study by the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—for it is very easily transmitted—was completely gone" and that it could "be transformed into a seasonal disease, capable of reappearing each year."
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Current symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretions (muchosis), loss of smell, swelling, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemopathy, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people is severely ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify symptoms of emergency symptoms such as respiratory distress, persistent pain or thoracic pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakening, and face or bluetongue; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent development of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicaemia, septicaemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms, but with results from the test that confirm the infection, then researchers issued recommendations that people who had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese asymptomatic evaluations range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) is between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. For example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with VOCID-19 who lost the odor was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted primarily in close contact and for droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have revealed that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) at 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted through droplets that would remain in the air over longer periods, which could be projected by speaking. Respiratory drops can also be projected at the expiry, especially by speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Posts may land in the mouth or nose of other people located next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus lead to air spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that they may be transmitted through the saddles, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has excluded the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but the spread may be possible before symptoms occur and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive to the disease up to three days prior to the occurrence of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few asymptomatic case reports confirmed in laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if one does not know exactly how easy the disease is to spread, one person usually contaminates two to three others.
Specifically, the virus could be detected at the end of three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after a day on cardboard, and at the end of four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals were tested positive at the COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, the British authorities recommend washing their hands after affecting animals, such as having been in contact with other areas that infected people might have affected.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three patients with Wuhan acute respiratory disease cases.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it would be zoonotic.
A genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (Lignage B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is identical to 96% of the total genome of another coronavirus sample of bats-suris (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolin virus and human virus.
The comparison of the whole genome revealed to date a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between the pangolin coronovirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, the final confirmation is carried out by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanning.
A study comparing the PCR and scanner at Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, as much of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the scanner should not be used to detect or as a first-intention test to diagnose the COVID-19".
WHO issued several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available in a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinoparynx sampling but also a throat sampling can be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and tomodescence (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral glass opacity and a lack of pleural expansion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Because of the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed imaging by PCR is limited to detect the COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the thoracic scan results to the PCR and showed that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in the epidemic areas.
Convolutional neuron networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect characteristics of the virus in the imaging both on radiographs and scanners.
Disease transmission prevention strategies include overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the hand directly into a garbage bag.
It was recommended to those who would have already been contaminated to wear a public surgical mask.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential travel to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. It is recommended that health care professionals deal with someone who might be infected with usual precautions and contact precautions, and wear protective glasses. Contact search is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of telephone tracking data by Governments in this regard has raised confidentiality issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communiqué calling for limitations on this type of monitoring.
Several mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record a user's presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive at the COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, scratching the nose and garnishing with oral bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one vaccine.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often in soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before they eat; and after they have drunk, coughed, or sneezed.
It's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended that a disinfectant be used for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% of alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), in particular ethanol at 62–71%, isopropanol at 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5%, and iodine povidone at 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment as an office building or creek, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by the sick persons, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their elbow bent or a handkerchief when they cough or fade, and to throw out every handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the projected posters by speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions explaining where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Having a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hands hygiene."The use of masks has also been advocated for those who care for a person potentially infected with the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they deal with a COVID-19-infected patient, even though it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not to touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their population to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical masks in fabric. China specifically recommended the use of medical masks released to healthy people, especially in case of proximity (1 metre (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transportation or docks.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to make face masks in themselves and to clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outlets without masks or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone would protect themselves and protect others.
The Austrian government ordered anyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the wear of the mask on passengers of long-distance trains and buses on April 1st.
Panama has made the wearing of a mask mandatory for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of an artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes measures to control infections to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distancing methods can be applied by remaining at home, limiting travels, avoiding crowds, greeting without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by government and health agencies in the United States was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious disease and complications. They were invited by the CDC to stay at home as far as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations have begun to replace the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing" to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by preserving social links, whether virtually or by maintaining a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" meant believing that total social isolation should be used, rather than encouraging people to maintain contact with others through other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with someone with whom you live, who does not have the virus or presents any symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for those diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in the affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people from the most at risk groups.
People who were exposed to a COVID-19 disease and those who had recently traveled to a country or region where transmission was very important were invited to be quarantined for 14 days from the moment they were able to be exposed for the last time.
Epidemic control strategies are intensification or suppression, and mitigation.
Intensification is established during the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When disease spread is no longer possible, efforts are being made towards the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow it down and to mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Intensification and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The elimination requires more extreme measures to reduce the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. One part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, masking and individual quarantine; social distancing measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; as well as environmental actions such as surface cleaning; more drastic measures to curb the epidemic have been taken in China as long as the gravity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the quarantine of whole cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced localized mass screening and quarantine, and issued alerts on the displacement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected individuals who have quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not done so.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States have shown that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
The removal may be preferred, but it must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), because otherwise the transmission is rapidly rebounded when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medicines without an order against the cold or consumption of drinks and rest can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can aggravate the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of VOCID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" may soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care for the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by the WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services for resource redeployment at different levels, including through the provision of laboratory services to VOCID-19 tests, by cancelling non-emergency interventions where possible, separating and insulating patients tested positive to VOCID-19, and by strengthening intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of available fans and beds.
There are various theories concerning the place of origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could go back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of coronovirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
They are generally related to Huanan's seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. A home of unknown cause pneumonia was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital of the province of Hubei, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SRAS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was rebuked by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of an unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to initiate an investigation early January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub and a major railway correspondence site.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by posting the most confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 were healed.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted travel and border controls.
The national reactions included measures such as quarantine (also called orders to stay at home, shelter on site or confinement) and fire cover. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are subject to a form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people in the world had a form of confinement, a figure of 2.6 billion later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 to Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would go back to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a home of unknown cause pneumonia cases on 26 December, which she informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
The initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
The doctors in Wuhan received a warning to have "propagated rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to indicate the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the greatest quarantine in human history," a health cordon was announced on January 23 to stop travel from and to Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting approximately 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
Celebrations of Chinese New Year (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was subsequently built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as conference and stadium centres, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to identify the epidemic of COVID-19, including the issuance of health reports for travellers and the extension of the holidays for Spring.
Universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote working measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
The population displacement control was applied in many cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) were involved in one form or another of displacement restrictions. After the epidemic entered the world in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country in the previous five days, in the event via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang stated that the spread of cases transmitted within the country was essentially blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced to Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the beginning of the confinement. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry for the holders of a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specifying when that policy was to end.
People wishing to enter China must therefore apply for a visa in Chinese embassies or consulates.

Of the 9 336 church members, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms on 22 February. South Korea announced the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korea military bases were set up in quarantine after three soldiers were tested positive to the virus.
Air companies' schedules have also been affected and therefore modified. South Korea has introduced what was considered the largest and most organized program in the world to test the population with the virus, and to isolate all infected people as well as follow and quarantine the people who have been in contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via mobile application, virus screening drives delivering the results the next day, and increased test capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's programme is seen as a success in the control of the epidemic, although it did not put 40 whole cities into quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's prosecution for the government's poor management of the epidemic or, on the contrary, his response.

A CNN report indicated that the combination between the large elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all people with the virus to date could have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first appeared as one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any form of social dissociation or 40 mass measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of reactivity and liveliness in response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, recommending all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and showrooms.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational establishments such as pubs and sports halls should close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of the wages of workers, within £2,500 a month, to avoid unemployment linked to the crisis.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control, the U.S. government's main public health institute, announced that it had developed its own screening kit.
Despite this, the United States has made time to start testing, which has obscured the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were initiated by defective screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval by the federal government for non-governmental screening kits (universities, businesses and hospitals) until the end of February and restrictive criteria for qualifying for a test until early March (the order of a required doctor later).

WHO has praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the management and control of the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where the Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment that impeded prevention and induction efforts, and the current crisis in which the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of New Moon Year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban to Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that even if it was "not a recommendation from the WHO," it was, however, a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is the most concentrated" and he spoke of a "unprecedently in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic was an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked during the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhamom said that the USPPI was due to "the risk of global spread, especially for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason why measures should interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparation in low-income countries, calling for the urgent need to support those countries that "have no systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear".
Tedros then said that we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest or pay more tomorrow." On 11 February, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was named COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the “force of the entire United Nations system into the response”.
Therefore, a United Nations crisis management team has been activated to coordinate the overall response of the United Nations, which the WHO says will allow them to "focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to provide expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic."
On 14 February, a WHO-led joint mission team was engaged in China to deploy international experts and WHO on-site to support national management and assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural environments."On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronary artery pandemic", indicating that although it is too early to speak of pandemic, each country should nevertheless enter "in preparation phase".

Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you must keep yourself ready," adding that the right response measures could help the world to avoid "the worst."
Ryan then indicated that current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we accept in absolute terms that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronovirus epidemic could be described as a pandemic.
The Director-General indicated that the WHO was "extremely concerned at both alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction." The WHO faced important criticisms of its management of the pandemic, which was deemed inadequate, including due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.

The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British cabinet minister Michael Gove and the son of Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for managing the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were noted for their functions following their management of quarantine in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political leaders to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger compared to the coronovirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronovirus epidemic would have begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracyist theories supporting that the COVID-19 would hold its origins in the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration called the coronovirus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", stating that in China "the censorship has overpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which was then taxed by some opponents and intended "to divert attention from the inability of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has sought a telegram from the U.S. government outlining the lines of a communication strategy apparently from the National Security Council, whose strategy is quoted as follows: "Everything comes from China.
We are asked to try to communicate this message in every possible way, especially at press conferences and television apparitions." Press bodies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have argued that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus were part of a growing propaganda to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy leader Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "generosity policy".
Borrell also stated that “China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also called on the United States to lift their sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending aid to the latter two countries prior to that.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma in Cuba were blocked by US sanctions on 3 April.

This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-placed political source" which indicated that 80 percent of Russian aid was "little or no useful for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed gratitude.
Russia has also sent a medical-aided jet to the United States.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov stated that "by offering his assistance to his American colleagues, [Poutine] shares the principle that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to render the same as necessary."
The magnitude of NATO's "defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries will be reduced by NATO's greatest manoeuvre since the end of the cold war.

The President of Iran Hassan Spirituale wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, stating that his country had difficulty in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets because of the US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic called on the United States to adopt common social policies to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare program, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election during the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after the latter announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed two weeks in quarantine on government designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided on the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's prosecution for the government's poor management of the epidemic or, on the other hand, praising its response. The pandemic has enabled countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to authorize the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree until new order, to suspend parliament and elections and to punish anyone who would be accused of spreading false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The coronovirus epidemic has been charged with several cases of supply breakdowns, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and interruption of plant and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Products Agency has issued warnings regarding drug shortages and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and interruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of necessities such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, causing shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has alerted delays in e-product shipping.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhamom, the demand for individual protective equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This application resulted in an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also resulted in delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also resulted in a shortage of individual protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that this will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity to Daligos to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of child milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in North Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products, these two areas were spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages planned in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural production, North Italy did not see significant decline, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food rays have been emptied only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government members have released pork reserves to ensure adequate population survival.
Similar laws exist in Italy to ensure that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.

In North America and the Middle East, traders found a drop of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a drop of 33 to 43 per cent of pedestrian traffic in shopping centres in March compared to February.
The operators of commercial centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as the increase in cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of customers and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional persons under extreme poverty in Latin America in relation to a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, during the peak epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the some 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves trapped in domestic provinces or stuck in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for help from the government.
The coroner virus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confining in India has left dozens of millions of migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) to unemployment. The Angus Reid Institute's survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement imposed on mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies had their employees shift to a government-subsidised partial activity scheme called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time compensation scheme was adopted by France and Britain.
The arts sectors of the show and the cultural heritage have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations and individuals, both employed and independent, at the global level.
Art and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, showrooms and other cultural institutions were closed to new order and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry has also been interrupted. The Vatican has announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which take place the last week of the Christian penitence period of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or television while others propose to practice their worship as a "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels and the Saint Peter Square, which was visited by all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants into the sacred sites of La Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most important interruption of the global sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, the EUFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 LNH season.
The epidemic disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which initially had to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but not later than the summer 2021". Casinos and other gaming institutions around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has driven many players to sign up online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new recordings. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups that have suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many great theatres, such as those on Broadway, also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet by replacing traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online festivals created for artists to produce, disseminate and promote their works.
Online, many Internet memes on the topic of coronavirus spread because many prefer humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a rise in prejudices, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still limited in China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received a justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei inhabitants reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to Chinese, whether online or offline, and to people in areas affected by the virus.
As a result of the spread of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, the Italians, who live in the first European country to suffer a severe epidemic of COVID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea first signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan became angry on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced the criticism for qualifying the coronovirus as a "China virus", a term considered by his detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North East India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The president of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh's Bengale-Western Unit said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The comments were subsequently condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, who described them as "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were triggered by the pandemic, while foreigners were described as "foreign waste" that should be "removed".
Many paid-access newspapers have been removed for any or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the open access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of coronovirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for the detection of the virus and the detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronary artery RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA only.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too light to be reported or asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests conducted in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngeal cavity or the expectoration sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharyngeal valves is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Thereafter, the virus may disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In patients tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken in deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or a burning (expectoration) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charity in Berlin in January 2020 using an inverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), and was the base of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the specific RdRP gene at SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the emergency authorization of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR.In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CCD) distribute their diagnostic device by RT-PCR in real time of the new coronovirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the old versions of the kits, one in three genetic test obtained non-conclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a test bottleneck at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at this time that federal and local laboratories were authorized to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories started testing early in March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of NCOVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also distributed national VOCID-19 tests on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. Sample collection and treatment must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Centre for Research in Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test at COVID-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA authorization for a test that could be carried out in large quantities within 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Holic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA US test for approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal amplification technology for nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently approximately 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically related to the protein of the new coronovirus (N protein) nucleocapside is developing in Taiwan, hoping that it can deliver results in 15-20 minutes, as a rapid flu test.
A literature study in March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary X-rays present low diagnostic value at early stages, while the results of TDM [tomodensitometry] can be conclusive even before symptoms appear."
Typical symptoms visible on the TDM include multi-lobial bilateral depolital glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and consolidation are developing as the disease evolves.
A study comparing the PCR to the TDM in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that the TDM is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, several of its imaging results coincident with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that "TDM is not used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC recommended the PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These may be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and in the context of population surveillance. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CTA) or by patient's hair test (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The high-speed automated systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For the TLC, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, only one blood sample is generally taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody testing.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation.End of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their testing kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
The antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the testing kits to the antibodies purchased by the country was capable of being used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which suspicious cases may remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube," patients crack inside, refer it and receive the result of the test later.The British NHS has announced that it will carry out a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the context of the VOCID-19 test drive for suspected cases, a health professional takes a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The drive centres allowed South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive screenings in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Mandatory Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform some 12,000 outpatient tests per day, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, driving tests were available in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that in the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to the 12/2020 week and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) had a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples from 64 patients at once, by grouping samples and only by testing if the combined sample is shown positive.In Wuan, an unlikely 2,000-metre-square-denoise laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: , i.e., "Fire Eye" in French) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, and can handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
Thanks to its five-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, modelling revealed that cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multixed free models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1 122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without a liquid manipulator robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has led some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes to continue testing.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing most of its population per capita for the Coronavirus, and were in the process of intensifying testing to reach the majority of the population.
These results have been achieved through a combination of the ability to drive tests and the purchase of a population-wide high-speed laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different testing formulas targeting different parts of the coronovirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to manufacture kits sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020.The protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centres was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of testing kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and testing recommendations of health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, largely in private-sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programs as a better means of slowing down the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for virus-wide testing caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be delayed in the United States private laboratories, and the reserves of chemical
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the CDC-developed test kits presented "deficiency".The government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing.Spain purchased test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be related to the inability to collect samples or to use kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it will remove the kits that have failed results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic have provided false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits in China that have proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey purchased in China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million testing kits in China, but announced early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who achieve a positive result and the tracing of people who have been in contact with the carriers of SARS-CoV-2, has yielded positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first death linked to the COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, to about ten days apart.
Nearly half of the people who achieved a positive result did not have symptoms, and all of the cases found were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement in the commune, this measure has completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracing, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronary virus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun to advise residents to stay with them on March 28, but schools have reopened at the scheduled date at the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, entry, screening and quarantine restrictions, but with less aggressive confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that performed the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have significantly lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories only have limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to perform confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the table below, the "positive as % of tests" column depends on the national screening policy.
A country that does not prove that people admitted to the hospital will have a positive value as a percentage of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they present symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Handwashing, also called hand hygiene, is due to the cleaning of hands to remove dirt, fat, micro-organisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via oro-fecal.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example by omitting to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands in soap at five key moments of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's butts or changing its layers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
If you have no water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands in ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after it has been bitten or coughed/skinned;
after affecting an animal, animal food or waste of animal origin;
Hand hygiene in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medicines or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand-washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterial, virus or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronovirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during births at home.
According to a study carried out in 2013, improvement in hand hygiene practices could result in a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as handwashing in soap.
This simple practice may reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by nearly 50%.
Action to promote hand-washing could reduce diarrhea episodes by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying low-income regions with drinking water.
Washing your hands in soap allows you to reduce diarrhea by 48 per cent and is the most effective and costly way to prevent acute diarrhoea and respiratory infections (IRAs). This is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which accounts for nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the practice of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and almost half of the deaths due to diarrhea and one quarter of the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is generally associated with other health measures in the water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
Washing hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deletion, frequent handwashing can weaken the skin by causing skin desiccation.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive handwashing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly frequent among health workers.
Too common handwashing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessional disorder (CTO).
It is important to wash your hands to the soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (mission, disinfection), after cleaning the buttocks of a baby (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
It is also appropriate to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after treatment of a cut or injury, after being wiped, coughed or bitten, after affecting animal waste or handling animals and after having affected garbage.
In many countries, the rate of soap hand cleaning is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 with 54 countries and on hand hygiene, 38.7 per cent of households on average washed their hands with soap. A study carried out in 2014 showed that the rate was the highest in Saudi Arabia (97 per cent), the United States was in the middle of the table (77 per cent) and China had the lowest rate (23 per cent). Today there are several methods for changing behaviours and democratizing the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. In particular, it is possible to propose to schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day so that children do this habit.
For example, the Philippine Ministry of Education has implemented a "primary Health Care Program" to promote the health and education of children.
Deparasitation twice a year, associated with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the micro-organisms present on the skin, it is appropriate to add soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic soils, are difficult to solve in the water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap found that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicates that “automatic liquid soap distributors are preferable”.
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to people concerned with their health status.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants allows to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain current antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms are resistant.
Therefore, although antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the active and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary sanos were as effective as antibacterial sanos intended for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of warm water did not help to reduce microbial burden on the hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early twenty-first century, non-alcohol-based non-aque-hand hygiene products (called hydro-alcoholic solutions, anti-septic solutions for the hands or disinfectants for the hands) began to become popular.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thick agent such as carbon (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or to a moisturizer such as glycerine to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the absorbing effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide reinforces the antimicrobial activity. hand disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after the application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after the application.The disinfectants for the hands are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and nails should be faced for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing rather than using hydro-alcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their quick disposal activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may result in skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by moisturizers and/or moisturizers of the skin.
The effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritant contact dermatitis made them more attractive than washing hands to water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, as they remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hands disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and the formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas using benzalkonium chloride presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after the application, unlike alcohol, which is mitigated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many have no means to buy soap, and use ash or land instead.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
What is more, if the soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it is likely to increase the spread of diseases rather than stop it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the hands be washed properly to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Swallow a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action of friction creates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and to fry longer to remove more germs.
Rinse enough in running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant watershed can result in hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or free air.
Wet and wet hands can easily reconnect.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and nail polish can accommodate microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin injury that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, to make water flow from a suspended or perennial cane and/or to use as hot as necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as typy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging hook using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers often found in the toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers and more modern jet-hands.
After the washing and drying of hands in hot-air hand dryers, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased on average 194% on the thumb pulp and 254% on the palms.
Dry-drying with jettisoning resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the thumb of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the thumbs and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether cross-contamination potential exists with other toilet users and the environment of the toilets depending on each method of drying.
The air-jet mornings, which blow off the aircraft at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), can expel the microorganisms from the hands and the device and potentially contaminate other toilet users as well as the environment of the toilets within a perimeter of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air dryer allows microorganisms to be broadcast at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres of the day-dry.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Product und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand-drying, the following changes in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers were compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in a medical setting became mandatory well after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent hospital illnesses.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical washing of hands must last for at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to bite and fry each part of the hands.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by walking between fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a fur brush to remove them.
Since the germs in the water are likely to stay on hand, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from re-contamination to contact the surfaces.
The objective of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogens ("growths") and avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand-washing remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, a large number of doctors and nurses who regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, the proper washing of hands and follow-up of other simple procedures may reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed to wash and rub hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect feedback from netizens.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Devices available in trade can measure and certify the hygiene of the hands, if compliance with the regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Indications" on Hand Hygiene as follows:
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After contacting the patient, adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (we know "medical" or "antimicrobials") provides the hand washing agent with an action to destroy germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To "frote" their hands for surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without being touched by hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry their hands after washing them, a sterile brush to fry and another sterile instrument to clean under nails.
All jewels must be removed.
Under this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should be prevented from flowing to the hands.
Once the hands are washed, it is appropriate to dry your hands using a sterile linen and to put on a surgical jacket.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Comparing hand washing with a common soap to that made with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing hand cleansing with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, it is observed that the first decreases bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A virus (H1N1) and Clostridium spores present in the hands. In order to improve the hygiene of the hands in health care institutions, it is possible, inter alia, to train staff in hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to it and to send written and verbal reminders to it.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap washing is considered to be an inexpensive and essential tool to preserve health, or even to feed properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite economic options to build hand washing stations.
Nevertheless, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting soap-washing and raising awareness can influence policy decisions, bring about benefits related to this practice and lead to a long-term change in behaviour within the population.
In order to achieve this, follow-up and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand-washing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective; in terms of promoting hand-washing in schools, UNICEF's "Third Star Approach " can be mentioned, which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can switch from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations may be part of the hand hygiene campaigns that are carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
The World Day of Handwashing is another example of awareness-raising campaign that claims to promote behavioural development.Following the coronovirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji depicting handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the number of healthy years of life earned (i.e. avoiding DALY).
However, one review suggests that the promotion of soap-washing is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers injured in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two hands hygiene pioneers: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "modern nursing founder".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmes.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the incidence of COVID-19 in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters showing "good handwashing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The expression "washing hands" refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It came from a Bible verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, by Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary spot, symbol of her bad conscience in view of the crimes she has committed and that she has encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that some individuals, after recalling or considering acts contrary to ethics, tend to wash their hands more frequently than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for purposes of both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual washing of hands put forward in many religions, including Bahaism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, the washbasin in Christianity and the washbasin in Islam. Religions also prescribe hand washing for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash their hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash their hands before and after each meal.
VOCID-19 risk controls at the workplace
The VOCID-19 risk controls at the workplace refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary according to workplace and tasks, based on an exposure source risk assessment, community severity and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, lower exposure-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including hand-washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory label and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Jobs at risk of medium exposure include those requiring frequent or close contacts with persons without suspected or known VOCID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and some large-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of individual protective equipment in case of encounter with a person with VOCID-19.
The OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with suspected or known VOCID-19 with a high risk of exposure, to a very high risk if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of samples of persons with suspected or known VOVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
The epidemics of COVID-19 may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of others or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models can change, both with respect to the goods requested and the means to acquire them (particularly, to race outside the peak hours or to use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan to prepare and respond to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protection measures.
The plans take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic diseases.
They also outline the controls necessary to deal with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemics.
Plans for preparedness and response to infectious diseases may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The risk control hierarchy forms a comprehensive framework used in health and safety at work to group risk controls by efficiency.
Where the risks of VOCID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are the technical controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protective equipment.
Technical controls involve insulating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers; they can be the most economical solution to implement.
Administrative controls identify changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the worker's risk, properly adapted as needed (e.g., respiratory masks), properly worn and systematically inspected, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or discarded to avoid any contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures to prevent infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory label, including covering their mouth and nose for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and trash, preparing for telework or working hours when needed, deterring workers from using other tools and equipment and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others at a workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with acute respiratory symptoms stay at home until they have no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of febrifuges or other symptom-related medicines, and that they also recommend that flexible sick leave policies be applied, allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1.8 m) of persons without suspected or known VOCID-19 but which may be infected by SARS-COV-2 due to an ongoing Community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with a widespread transmission of VOCID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, especially in schools, high-density work environments and some high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly effective air filters, the increase in ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as high population density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at highest risk include the installation of highly effective air filters, the increase of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation rates of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic plastic plastic glass windows and the installation of a driving window window for the client service.

Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person becomes ill on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: to separate the patient from others by 6 feet, to appoint a crew member to take care of the patient and to offer a protective mask to the patient or to ask him to cover his or her mouth and nose using handkerchiefs when he or she coughs or sneezes.
The cabin crew shall carry disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger is suffering from fever, a persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items must be placed in a bag for hazardous biological wastes and contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned and disinfected subsequently. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include the postponement of the journey in case of disease and the immediate self-insulation and information of the medical on-board centre if a fever or other symptoms are developed once on-board.
Ideally, medical follow-up must take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person went to a school building, irrespective of community propagation.
In the case of minimal to moderate Community transmission, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational outputs, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choral or canteen meals, increasing the space between offices, increasing arrival and exit times, reducing non-essential visitors and using separate infirmary for children with flu-like symptoms.
In the case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For the law enforcement forces carrying out daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDC.
Order forces officers who must contact persons with suspected or confirmed VOCID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt prior to re-use using a laundry or detergent spray and follow the standard procedures for the containment and disposal of used IPRs, as well as the containment and washing of clothing.
The OSHA considers certain health and funeral workers as belonging to high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known VOCID-19.
They become very high risk of exposure workers if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of patients with suspected or known VOCID-19.
Procedures producing aerosols include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
High-risk funerary jobs include workers involved in the preparation of the bodies of persons with suspected or known VOCID-19 at the time of their death; they are at very high risk of exposure if they practice autopsy. The additional technical controls of these risk groups include the isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known VOVID-19, including when performing procedures producing aerosols.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain sanitary and funeral environments.
Samples must be handled using Level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms according to the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, the OSH recommends respiratory masks for those working less than 6 feet of patients with a suspected infection or known by SARS-CoV-2 and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 approved NIOSH or superior respiratory masks must be used in the context of a complete and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better comfort from the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO recommends the wearing of a surgical mask only by the screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or transport patients COVID-19 in the absence of procedures producing aerosols, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In case of aerosol-producing procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a patient COVID-19 to persons directly involved in its care, the use of PPE required for the specific task only, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of PPE and deterring the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

DATE/HEUREWEDEN: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and of the responsibilities that we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of global community empathy, cooperation and strengthening that is at the heart of this organization.
The fellowship and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud of you all to be among my colleagues.
Last week, someone thanked me for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the moment, and the strong symbol of the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain operational sites, make sure that our colleagues or the safety of our communities are paid.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will make consistent adjustments to how we work together from next week.
Adjustments to Our Work and Time Jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our time use in the days and months to come.
During this conversation, we have considered what we believe would be a suitable response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we were trying to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take a break, don't worry.
To all staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be about 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week to the new order.
We do not declare holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at present, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, to race, or to consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or pay leave required: just prevent your superior and help your team to review time schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed as positive with COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from the T&amp;C Ops department to help you with the T&amp;C and make sure your situation receives the necessary attention from management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced it, and we reiterate our commitment to honoring our responsibilities to our subcontractors and our colleagues in the hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of his usual working hours under normal conditions.
It's worth if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to eliminate their stress in the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly gratifying, especially in times like this one.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior so that we know what we are waiting for and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
SRE Teams, HR Ops, &amp; Security and Fund Collection (among others) perform essential work that may require backup.
We will initiate a process with all departments in order to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slow down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice more to catch up on time" when the pandemic will pass.
We will not ask you to do overtime to respect now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new objectives and timetables if necessary.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to our daily working time objectives, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to set up a budget to enable employees to focus on essential work, take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their reduced work schedule in the coming weeks.
This prolongation of deadlines considerably reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, too cautiously, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution of hospital quality to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own protocol of due diligence, which uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return there.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, which shared with us and all the staff members based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues are working at a distance for the first time.
Our habitual colleagues in remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce meeting duration to meetings of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider apportioning them over several days.
clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, thanks to tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and online exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or make collective notes).
Send an electronic mail to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your welfare refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations Team studies ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all the beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the a-thons, until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both of sadness in the face of turmoil and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the following, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space so that the community can monitor the impact and continue our communication with them.
Stay in touch despite the problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This applies to us all and we are here to help you in any way.
By then, you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to the COVID-19, on Office Wiki.

We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff members residing in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, major workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and provide liaison if necessary.
For confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of International Global Operations HR.
None of these changes should be regarded as abandoning our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that at present our work and our obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These steps are those that we consider necessary to support each other and to continue our work, to bring to our movement the help he needs, and to provide the world with the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be here waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to assist and prepare for the important work that will take place in the weeks and perhaps in the months to come.
We need each one of you to get there, that is why you need to preserve yourself and take care of your families in order to be able to give the best of yourself at the moment.
Finally, please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is an enzyme related to the external face (cell membranes) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestine cells.
ACE2 against the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of certain coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a methyloenzyme containing zinc on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains a N-term M2 peptidease domain and a C- terminating renal amino acid collectrine transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane type I protein, with an enzymatic active area on the surface of the lungs cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of the ACE2 is clipped from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called seddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is connected to the cellular membrane mainly of cells of type II pulmonary alveols, enterocytes of the grain intestine, blood and vein endothelial cells, and the arteries of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 ARNm is also present in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate the ACE.
ACE climates angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ACE2 cleves amino phenylamine with angiotensin II carboxyle (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and vasodilator angiotensin hydrolysis (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also blink several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinine, apeline, neurotensine, dynorphine A, and ghreline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus originating in SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus originating in COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 strain protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of the ACE2 to the cell surface results in endocytosis and in the translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes within the cells.
This process of entry also requires the initiation of the S protein by the TMPRSS2 host serum protein, which is currently being inhibited as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can contribute to the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended continued standard treatment with the help of ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant reduction of 34% of pneumonia risk compared to test subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitor who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those who have CVA and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less evident than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The converting enzyme of human recombinant angiotensin 2 (rhACE2) is presented as an innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolisaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to conventional inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. RhACE2 under infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 kronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons ("contacts") likely to be contacted with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on the tracing of the geographic location of application users, raise questions about privacy.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application named TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!" a Bluetooth application to track exposure to potentially infected people and to communicate quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Department of Communications and Technologies and the Department of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the tracking of contacts was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCvid").
Australia and New Zealand are planning to set up applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a georification application for patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis and resident in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, raised several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple only authorizes "official" or generally trustworthy organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists expressed concerns about the implications of coronary virus applications for mass monitoring, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to address the coronary artery pandemic once the threat was removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of monitoring.
These organizations provided eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extensions of control and surveillance should include extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the COVID-19 targets;
data security and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
digital monitoring should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
protections against abuse and recourse should be provided for citizens in the event of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all "stakeholders concerned" would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by deleting the mechanism of tracing the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, the network trace was approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present important potential privacy concerns.
However, all central server-based systems do not need access to personal localization data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, allowing privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to trace contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, which they then associated with in order to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to notify potential contacts, the government also made localization information accessible to the public, which was permitted following the profound changes in the privacy protection laws of the information after the SRS epidemic affected that country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems that preserve privacy.
The details have not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The mapping of privacy-respected contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-respected solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PCT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all matching is done on the device.
The Privacy Group of MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques when collecting and using localization or contact data to monitor the spread of the COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace de Enigma MPC platform, a company that develops privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure material technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and sanitation data with other users and authorities without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, a key factor in their adoption by a broad audience.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would help preserve privacy and involve Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption ensuring confidentiality.
They have also published the specifications of basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official applications for privacy-respecting coronavirus tracing
Direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the problems of adopting the solution and persistence of monitoring by initially distributing the system through up-to-date operating system and subsequently deleting it in the same way once the threat is removed.
The repositioning of a drug (also called reorientation, reprofilation, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) means the conversion of an approved medicine for a disease or for a medical condition other than that for which it was initially developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these liaison sites provides the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are the papain-type protein, dependent RNA polymerase ARN, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribosis phosphate.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-paludene medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the related chloroquine and hydrochloroquine would be part of the four drugs studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the New York State tests on chloroquine and hydrochloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency authorisation (USA).
The treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the U.S. only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydrochloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Physicians reported using this medicine "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in association with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School conducts a test on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydrochloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipyravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who had not received it.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipyravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence for the drug is minor and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine in Japan for its reserves and use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for the Trump administration to acquire the medicine. The medication may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who are trying to grow up.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded "no benefit was observed."
These drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado tried to change these drugs to find a compound that would be related to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several philoviruses, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronovirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one on people with moderate pathology and one on those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing intravenous vitamin C clinical trials for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill of the COVID-19; two controlled against placetabo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The New York State began testing for azithromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) provides for a clinical trial of Teijin's alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected by the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is being tested phase II with 200 patients to be recruited among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years of age and over who have been diagnosed as positive to COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or those who do not have an effective contraception method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients and studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on the repositioning of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and Western Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Humifenovir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Testing is also in progress in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many attempts to develop are ongoing.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, a disease virus before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in phase I safety study.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak occurred worldwide in 2020, generating important investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, ECI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms conducted research and development projects early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets in phase I security studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenoviral vector)
As ECI scientists stated in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are at the first stages of development, including 78 (79 from the Milken Institute) confirmed as assets and 37 other announcements, but with little public information available (presumed under planning or design).
A phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against placebo and carried out in several centres, determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring the adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccines (early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human person assessment phase (always in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pinched vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced that it had started working on a vaccine, which human tests were expected to start in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with her partner in biotechnology, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neo-antigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.

On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Genex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that she had started a vaccine project to create a Ii-Key peptides vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in man "at 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project for the development of a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both west of Maryland, announced work on a vaccine.
Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced joining Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedures, it would take about one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a Quebec biotechnology company, indicated developing a particle similar to coronavirus thanks to the partial funding of Canadian health research institutes.
The candidate vaccine is in the process of laboratory research, with tests on humans scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "a large sum of money to benefit from exclusive access to the vaccine against the VOCID-19", which led to the protest of the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an ARN-based vaccine.
The BNT162 NRA-based vaccine is currently in preclinical test phase with the start of the clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the man test for its candidate final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium for the search of a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and Pittsburgh University, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US$29 million.
The remaining ECI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing the animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 to be developing a VNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of China sending the sequence.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian societies and universities such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the $192 million-C assignment dedicated to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with plans to create a national vaccine bank containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronary virus epidemics occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University of Medicine School reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, claiming that "SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine sub-units administered by micro needles triggered an important response from antigen specific antibodies [for mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the design of a potential DNA vaccine candidate in the form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-hosted computer resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomised trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health professionals.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need to implement level 3 biosafety containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against the MERS.
When MERS spread, existing SARS research was thought to serve as a model for developing vaccines and medicines for infection at MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, only one vaccine against MRS (based on DNA) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were in progress; all vaccines were in viral vector, two with adenovir vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one with MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social media have published a conspiracy theory that the virus that originated the VOCID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various publications on social networks refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronovirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Current symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in moderate symptoms, some develop towards viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, over 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus spreads mainly during proximity contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Since these droplets are produced at expiry, they usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days following the onset of symptoms, although the contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during later stages of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the actual-time polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing masks by the public generally vary, some authorities recommend their use, others recommend their use, and others impose their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most of the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and exhaustion.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, persistent pain or thoracic pressure, confusion, walking difficulties and a face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal flow or throat pain may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease may cause pneumonia, the failure of several organs and the death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period of the COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days after the infection. Reports indicate that all infected people will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission started to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; out of 166 infections observed today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectoration and saliva can both carry important viral loads.
Speaking loudly releases more drops than talking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient's chambers produced positive samples to the viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus lead to aerial spread.
Although there are concerns about the spread of the stems, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if one does not know exactly how easy the disease is to spread, one person usually contaminates two to three others.
Specifically, the virus could be detected at the end of one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (ISI 304) and at the end of four hours on 99% copper.
This varies, however, depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap based products degrade the lipid protective layer of the virus, which deactivates and eliminates the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glucone (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salt samples were taken on average two days after initiation of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease outbreak.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) which is the most abundant in the type II alveolary cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called spicule (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac lesions were reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial lesions may also be associated with ECA 2 receptors in the heart.
The receptors of ACE 2 are strongly expressed in the heart and in the heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with unfavorable prognosis. Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropic for respiratory tract epithelial cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, GM-CSF secretory T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at the autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase in real-time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinoparyngeal sampling; however, nasal or expectoration sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours, or up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but they require two blood samples taken at two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independently of chain polymerization reaction tests (CPR) to detect virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (possible to detect active infections and previous infection of a person) were under development, but not widely used.
China's test experience revealed a precision of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test close to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobal bilateral depolital glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Pluural dominance, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuresis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
Moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytary hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASD) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolary cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation spread (CIVD); leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding bouncing places, frequently washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, getting good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hands hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering its face using a fabric in public places, to limit transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with large groups by stopping schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling important groupings of people.
Distance directives also include compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known drug to be effective in the prevention of VOCID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element of the management of VOCID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "applating the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before they eat; and after they have been drunk, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends the use of a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for commercial hands are not available, WHO offers two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is "not an antiseptic active substance for the hands".
Glycerol is added as moistant.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and the support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that persons suspected of being carriers of the virus carry a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a lifestyle and healthy diet were recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments may be useful for those who have moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for the IOCID-19.
Resuscitation and pneumologists in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the BCC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Regarding symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the front line.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in conditions of care when performing procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals with VOCID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an air-adapted isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air-transmission precautions. The CDC stresses the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (face masks) are preferred.
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or as a last resort, handcrafted masks.
The majority of cases of VOCID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases is.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-flow nasal canal or positive pressure of the double-level respiratory tract.
It is not known whether either or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to hold to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal canal. Serious cases are more common in older adults (over 60 years of age, in particular those over 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak of the number of cases of VOCID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
The mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
The high PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral medicinal products are clinically tested.
Redesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs are already being tested in other indications and the tests are already advanced.
Antiviral medication can be tried in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary plasma authorization of persons who competed as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
He was not submitted to the necessary clinical trials to demonstrate his safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "near contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not recommend only self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of massive data on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone localization and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security agencies to locate mobile phone data of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was intended to ensure respect for quarantine and to protect persons who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregate telephone localization data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, the Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera stated that he was informed by mobile telephone operators that "40 per cent of people continue to move."
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called on the world to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have moderate changes with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as the cold.
Moderate cases usually recover in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on similar virus data, such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severe cases affected, VOCID-19 can rapidly progress to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASD) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-visceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, clotting disorders and heart, kidney and liver lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, have been described in 6% of cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal impairment being observed in 4% of those in this group.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of people with COVID-19 have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five years in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of between six and 41 days.
In a study by the National Commission on Chinese Health (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples present a diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image looks like acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart injury due to high troponin rates or cardiac arrest have been observed.
According to data from March from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had preexisting diseases. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region can also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the disease mortality rate vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Sub-numbering of moderate cases may lead to an overstatement of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have a 2.4 times higher risk of getting into intensive care or dying from non-smokers. Concerns also emerged from long-term sequelae of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital administration observed a 20% to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some patients who were cured of the disease, and lung scanners suggest organic lesions.
This may also lead to post-intensive post-care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection had an effective long-term immunity in people who were cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered to be likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of cures of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be a worsening of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and animal-based, by propagation of infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost only led by a transmission from man to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first occurrence of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health.
At the end of 2019, WHO has affected emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for COVID-19 case deaths diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in a laboratory. The death/case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time range.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious lethality rate (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected persons develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, generating a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to VOCID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overburdened.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to the VOCID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in both men and women.
Human mortality is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is the highest among men in the 50th century, the difference between men and women disappearing only to 90 years.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% in men and 1.7% in women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a lower age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of the people who died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data related to the type of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, especially nursing, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with the international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly referred to as coronovirus.
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as "coronavirus" and "Whan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of provisional 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as valves and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency breathing valve and the supplier could not provide it in due time, a local startup retroconceived and printed the 100 required valves in one night.
After the initial epidemic of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to certain other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY trial to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, sub-unit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these research focuses on the S-ply protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new vaccination technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation was suggested as a potential challenge in developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are under way.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved against malaria, including four studies on hydrochloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on redesivir in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of candidates for vaccines and medications against VOCID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicinal products are evaluated in the treatment of VOCID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydrooxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the efficacy of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with medesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some request independent analysis of research.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan virology institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that twice the dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by means of an emergency authorisation for the discretion of physicians treating patients of COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or humifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating a low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial-particle protein starting with serum 2 transmembrane protein (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the receptor of ACE 2.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limits that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock can be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic shock-related properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
Phase 2 is being unrandomised at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be the cause of the death of certain affected persons.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of cytokines re-re-engagement syndrome with steroids induced by a different cause, treatment by CAR T cells in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of the SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have healed of VOCID-19 to those who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinational method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody processing can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example by using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Convalescent people's serum production, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronovirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
