I think it looks like a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But it doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that says it's common in rugby is anything big...
Yes at last we do not interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we do not break the nose of anyone during the drinking games (in the end, unless it is part of the game), but we actually painted black for some disguised evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme.
Yeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first-year students seemed rather typical to me.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt in my eyes that they go far beyond misogynistic jokes and jokes under the influence of alcohol often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly that they are trying to cause maximum.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your prejudices and stereotypes interfere with the facts?
I imagine that the rugby LSE team is populated by former students of these schools for whom rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, old private boys.
From very different backgrounds than those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
Is " misogynistic jokes" acceptable?
It looks like my university rugby club, I've never seen racist behaviour, but naked races across campus, theft, damage to property and misogynistics were all part of the game.
Not at all.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it in my last comment.
You can see it otherwise: say that your own body is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm going to win in serenity.
So ancient this interstellar cloud (or, not traditional:)
@lux You have not read the article well: a small half of your pastry water has more than 4.6 billion years...
Yes, well we can at least consider that the pasta fleet is on average easily over 2.3 billion years, which is not so bad yet.
A sacred foot of nose to the catastrophyists and reheaters of any hair that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always exists.
Unquestionable proof that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What is proof that the warming stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Trop's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological issues.
It is not a question for the "catastrophists" as you say to worry about the disappearance of the oceans but rather about the reduction of water reserves consumed by humans (you know the fresh water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally, it is not climate warming that is the most threatening for our species but especially the reduction of low- or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly greedy lifestyles.
As for the study you mention and of which you make a generous effort to quote the source, there is little doubt of the veracity of the conclusion.
With regard to freshwater problems, I assure you that the French are far from being affected xD Then we must stop considering ecology as a dogma without fail, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (100% estimate for 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology yes, ecology religiously dogmatic and irrational, not thanks.
"Then we must stop considering ecology as a dogma without fail, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly" Yes, it's not like it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that by the action of the oxygen will capture the heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the process of the greenhouse exponentially.
Has anyone seen any direct actions so far?
Or the slightest sign that 10,000 boys would come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, whatever it might be?
I'm not sure!
In Abbott's little brain, perhaps sending RAAF to the Middle East is its version of direct action.
We're moving back, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot in the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% more CO2 than any climate model allowed give priority to replanting.
It makes sense no, since CO2 is the food of plants that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve flora worldwide.
Looks like this scientific fact has never been laid down.
Did you see the green army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument for plant food is just a fallacy distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials is perhaps carbon, but that doesn't mean that it's the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is fallious and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now invested where it will receive the most publicity to bring the Liberals back to the marginal electorate.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, brave champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants realize less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people must eat them in much larger quantities to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
Let this member of the House be at a loss, it is obvious.
To date, he has not submitted a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from withdrawing from the XVII rules.
However, to punish him and not Thévenoud, it is incomprehensible for not bad of the world, even if the ANA regulation is not a tax treaty.
That this lady does a whole business is not to her honour, it looks especially like hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined everyone who had pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academia" had failed: "Let us say Mrs. the guardianship or the guardianship of the Seals" (a position that had never been occupied by a woman until then).
Pure machismo!
"The political arena " ...!
The sand basin, the backyard of the Republic reflects, the marigot of the operette gloves, the table of illusions, and ...
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, good luck, bad luck.
Qd the Phallocrate Impist is based on the label and parliamentary regulation by turning to the + elementary civilization under the false umbrella in the right ways, the penalty applies to him "quality" for his partisan header and his measurement of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making provocations to talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, now he may be proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class.
The academy on the back and we see that the MPs are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to work to solve its internal problems and stop causing the shells and scandals.
The Academy has good backs, especially when it's being told what she's not saying.
This member behaves like a college student in the midst of adolescence crisis, who does the provocation and whose friends go, in delegation, to see the Principal to cancel glue hours.
and defending it on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories of this UMP forum.
Judge, I call on two expert witnesses only a few thousand years apart.
That's why I like to spend some time with the animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and appealing.
Dogs, dolphins, otaries, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure that it brings them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we are passionate about the majority of our 80s working, moving, and shopping.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two our lives, but we spend the majority in the boredom.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion of anthropomorphism.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try it again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variation that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to go looking for, etc.
It is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I adhere to the idea that we hear a lot of nonsense about animals that are "playing" while they are just communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "useful" (it may be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber believes that "there is a principle of play at the base of any physical reality."
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her" Maybe yes, hope makes life...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, be healthy, and be able to respond to an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and would have the same tendency to be rather enthusiastic about those who seem crazy at first sight.
But when you see what many have learned at school, especially among the public most likely to engage in attacks on women, my enthusiasm does not find the slightest beginning of anchorage.
"the public most likely to engage in attacks on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we got it.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel pink, even if it doesn't necessarily match your thoughts.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone6.
Evry's unargented youth too!
If the reactions did not react anymore, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I've never learned anything about it at school and I've never raped anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Do I have to think I'm lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How to start reading life when you can't read?
And do young socialists go to suburban schools to teach equality between men and women?
It would be more effective than doing moralizing assemblies on Twitter, but we should get out of the beautiful neighborhoods...
Drop this campaign.
They're null everywhere but to teach moral lessons, it remains the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I still want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke here about using his bread.
This week's article isn't going down there.
It's not time to make jokes about the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You made a double-sense word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach with a 90-year-old pensioner.
How does it get the more we pay, the less there's in the plate?
Because the quality of the experience does not necessarily measure itself to the weight or number of calories, as well as the quality of a film or a piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to get you to buy more dishes.
Of course, this is not the case.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you're still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more expensive you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child portion arranged with art in your plate.
At least they did their best to put on a nappes.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me that I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can taste good dishes?
Is the Manifest for all only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's right: a sort of gathering of homophobes.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "children's manufacturing".
A child must not be raised in a battery farm or manufactured by a technological apparatus.
Batteries?
Where do you get that from?
And if you challenge any technical intervention in the "manufacturation", it is necessary to demand the ban on LDCs for heterosexual couples, that would be the merit of coherence.
I am surprised that the manifest "for all" still does not have this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
it is true that it is not the only cathos that manifest: other religions also, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
That said, it is still helpful to remember that these different churches were opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup rose violently against the gvt's willingness to admit girls to school in the name of "the family's defense".
We're still in the same pattern.
And, more recently, the same currents shouted at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is the credit that can be given to the positions of these people.
You don't need to be catho to get involved in the marketing of belly and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom rests with that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who both have the right to love themselves and others.
But there is no question of tolerating that the child is a movable object.
And this is also valid for GPA search heteros.
I simply can't love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
Moreover, I am sure that any other attacker, other than Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will buy a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I can't disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals it has set, I won't talk about the other things it brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't bring or bring anything), but maybe that would be another reason why he won was much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12:48 Recommendation 119 It is the way to criticize Rooney at the moment so you can also be forgiven for doing so.
That said it is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and made 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
In fact, "Wazza" is rather a good reason for ridicule.
I have to ask myself if you really look at the football or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would have so many goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where Rooney's ability criticism comes from as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be selected regularly in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's footballer qualities (not even his attacker) to Peter Crouch's?
You're doing this without a joke?
There's really people at the mass.
Please also note for your government that Rooney hasn't always been England's leading goal machine during his British team career.
Instead, he played the retired front, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players like Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written that in a joke.
In a country where the arms port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a weapon, I find this totally schizophrene and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
Well those in this school are just not in accord with the U.S. license to carry weapons!
the use of the pencil is always suicidal.
Stop the bullshit: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids play with fake guns at this age in our house?
Is that actually powerful murderers?
Even though the arms port is in the U.S. constitution and it necessarily affects the culture of the country, I do not believe that rich children are significantly different from ours.
A bit of good sense and reason kept svp.
It's a disarming process!
Rendezvous you have been identified!
The information on this diverse event is insufficient to assess whether this little girl really has, or does not have at all, a premium for the taste of the disease.
Could we start from the principle that a serial killer can't already have a weird behavior at the age of 5?
If people need psy follow-up, it's more the mabuls of this school than the students!
Let the parents take their boy out of there: she's in danger!
I totally agree.
Those who run this school are obviously completely ill.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the USA, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
His relative youth?
These glamorous blue currants that men wear don't have a contractor!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson bring at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a pulley.
I can't comment too much since I've never looked at this, but everything seemed so boring and soulless.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Opposite, maybe?
But what's so depressing?
You've come ahead of me.
I would have thought a slight knowledge of English would be an asset for business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou does these days.
Perhaps by saying "ostracize", he meant "alienate".
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar were wearing a gray suit, we could advance that their intention was to ostracize her.
But here, no.
It looks like it's been corrected – weird. Maybe the whole sentence has been invented!
It's not weird.
Yeah, who knows what he might have said?
No way, but someone absolutely wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was "ostrace", which meant absolutely nothing to say.
The unemployment rate in the United States has still fallen out, about 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Gas prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, continually strengthens.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become "sustainable"?
In order to live there at the moment, I will say that the United States is slowly approaching the explosion as inequality becomes insane there.
The political system is literally rotten by the state of funding for election campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration are vast and unimaginable in Europe But Americans keep incredible optimism in the future of their country and their own!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago the English financial media said France was lost.
Now it's the American who's at the end of his roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
One more of these articles that simply forget the essentials.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and billboards could not yet give the change...
On the basis of land resource depletion and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and the poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "strink" or rather bite.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Will the Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing sympathetic voters from abroad makes him lose even more support at home?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any cost.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continues with Russia.
Labour's shameful performance, Ed Milliband is in the moose, it plays 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's massive immigration policy was designed "to forge the right nose in diversity"
The Labour wins the by-election, the Tories lose the by-election in safe siege against ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same Multiculturalism that leads to the return of the maneuver, the pendulum has extended far since the end of the war, and I imagine that now it will go back in the other direction.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Labour Headquarters, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for Labour it is a victory to the Pyrrhus.
Find the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used argumentatively against the word "defeated", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a win, but she's thin.
The Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent no matter what wins in 2015 as Lib Dems are not here.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice creams of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia come from hard.
On the other hand, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc should not be considered as well?
In general, we need to see the Earth more "paste" or malleable than we can imagine.
Is that so?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie speaks of a "simply simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the earth's crust, the pressure on the coat relaxes, which would give/give a) a whip to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ????
In any case, the "knocking" or the facilitation of access to the surface will be (more or less) located.
Difficult to distinguish the cause from the effect and inversely As for climate warming, it seems to me prudent to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, Patricedusud, does this volcanism have an effect on our environment?
Does it have an effect on our climate warming, future or past?
Isn't it prudent not to warm up anymore?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's dark, we see less well.
Hello, the end of the last glacier period was also accompanied by a stronger seismic activity, particularly in the "active" mountain chains where on the highly eglazed continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia.
Cordial CB
Too often it is not known that the earth's crutch floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it rise or descend from a few 30 to 60 cm, deferring, following its passage to the zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This means that the sliding of the tectonic plates, like the tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving broom, especially since the polar cassettes are lightened by the melt of the ice, which therefore causes a change in the earth's balance to the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am enjoying this "human," saying the Supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commander, ridiculed himself by his stupid action on the environment that created him and which he was so separated that he became harmful, and to himself and to this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this nature that exceeds him in the organization of his own viscera, by an invention that consists of finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, one another, mocking collaboration, money.
The earth's crust is not based on magma, but on the earth's coat, which is solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Ascent of Man from Bronowski.
Lively the next part.
Beautiful Wild1 Story
Rather, it reminds me of a totally brilliant 2002 series called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers it now.
Too bad you've never gone beyond the first impression.
Your loss...
"The ice creams, our distant ancestors" You should look again at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you Brian
I am almost certain that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been carried out several times, they still go to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I don't stand this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to pretend to make a kiss eyes in front of a brain in a mouthpiece.
And his story...
It must be hard for you, forced to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, you say.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be self, in itself, therefore non-conformity.
Certainly, but Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and its intellectual questioning expresses this advent.
But at that time it is just the premises that appear, today the individualism structure the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We're good at the individualism of "masse" !!
Without making it an independable horizon, there is no relation with the Cartesian approach to examining what is received to believe, what is believed to be self.
More than rebellion, doubt is fertile.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter - reform!
By placing the problem at the level of its paranoia nombrel, he blocked all progress and any reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reducing and reactionary vision that sustains: Behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right about this point and is anti-conformist, it is to fight against this decervelation.
We blame Marcel Gauchet for being a defender of order.
Excellent idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, ask some...
Blacks and currants, the others.
Beautiful and robots, include the most followers of those who see themselves in their mirrors.
Thanks in any case to his controversial contestants for putting Marcel Gauchet, this humanist patient and persistent, and so pedagogically enlightening, under the spotlight.
David Cameron supports the increase in inheritance tax threshold
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot is going to increase its net value well once he's no longer in power.
Business advice, speeches, consultation fees, a series of best-sellers written by a black on "serious policy" – it will be worth £100 once it has passed the gun on the left.
Of course, he doesn't want any inheritance tax.
Would it not be the same lie as in the last election?
And the richest are the ones who will certainly pay the least inheritance tax thanks to super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
it will be £100 once it has passed the weapon to the left.
Anything.
He's probably going to promise to increase the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say it's worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Do you also think that Brown thought only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't elect him last time, we had a coalition in place.
You could only allow him to be accused of lying if he was actually elected to power.
Like the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally."
Climate change and imminent collapse will end it, him and the others of his finish.
His "richness" will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded £1,000,000.
We must all be imposed to pay the essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I do not say that discipline didactics is unnecessary, of course, I only say that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "unsufficients".
Unreasonably statement for math teacher she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training for teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class has no other approach but quantitative.
There are 2 possible answers, the 1st would be to select teachers based on their ability to pass on knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
Plus, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to establishing a deficit relationship that causes everyone to suffer in pure loss => it takes 1 training to teach skills.
A job that learns, of course.
But pedagogy is first of all an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not making car parts.
The pedagogy doesn't get into an equation even when we're math teacher!
"Sciences of education" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently missing is a real vocation at bcp of those who embrace the teacher
If gifts exist, the pedagogy (I prefer didactic discipline) allows those who are less able to avoid making mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective question.
The real unknown today are the students 1/3 of whom tell us: learning is no good for anything I already know what I think.
A Slate article quite well describes the chaotic situation of this reentry.
We regret the old Normal Schools of Institutes..
It ends at 3 in the morning from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If you find it anyhow suited to his use of time.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't suit me!
It's been years since his show started in the middle of the night.
We have this thing that is called iplaying and that allows us to listen to broadcasts on demand when we want it!
The Internet, it's pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB in my home, I can't really listen to radio programs either.
I have a usb-type adapter behind my SKY box and which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seemed too complicated.
Yeah, I think I've been wrong about time, so I had to listen to Richard Lester at about three hours.
Even though it's men on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least it would make people happy.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
His show is anything sensational disguised as a debate, and it would be much better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women during the day, where none of Chris Evans' regular animators at Simon May's show in the morning on the return of the job, is not a woman
It's five shows.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows very well, but doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-departmental of these times.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a true journalist, but lunch keeps all the glacial air of a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine he's calm, waiting for the current team to get away with it or she gets fired.
I was born in Soismos in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for FN.
For 40 years we have had the same parties that alter the power and make the keys of the country less than they have taken.
The campaigns are very poor, significantly poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
It takes miles to find a movie, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But because they don't burn cars, don't get rough, don't go, they're not interested in politicians...
But thank you not to mention a department where you have not lived.
Yes, Doclocal, these are undermen, sociology is good to look at them.
They have very high rates of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The FN thrives on human stupidity, culture and ignorance as much as it still has huge growth potential, it really needs to be bad for not doing better...
Today, the FN mainly thrives on poverty, the fear of everyday life, the fear of the other and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
What a terrible humanity.
Fortunately, there is a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and learned to save honor.
They've been looking for him.
To take the voters for a couple of...
Here's what happens.
Who are they?
"forgetted" actually, there is less and less resource =>lower endowments.
This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen to you can't just "add and mix", women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by that is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being challenged, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles.
This allows women to recognize that they can work in the economic sphere and that is great - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will have a double scourge, that is, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfill their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced my sister.
Economics and profits do not recognize gender roles.
Money speaks, and if a sex isn't high, next!
The profits make fun of the life you lead.
What are you doing, what advantage and what do you have to offer?
The profits mock the heroism and the education of children.
If it were a crime, companies would listen.
Employer friends will never employ women between the ages of 20 and 45.
Well said my sister.
It is very problematic that no one is talking about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social labour (most of which is done by women) must be equivalent to more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive sufficient support and is undervalued (not to mention that men do not do enough of it), but it allows us to operate our societies and preserve our labour force.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find true "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to come back to Mskayadee's point, how can we take account of disproportionately women's responsibilities when conducting gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he'll help a lot of people who need to "check a house."
The tiger is not Russian but Western propaganda.
The Chinese alone are responsible for the current situation and would do better to sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger with the right to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are simply in exercise near the border, long-standing exercises prior to the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missile in its possession.
Free the Tigrisan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, hold on.
I got the same idea right now.
This is a pretext for arming some separatists to annex China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's only time to repair this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, beautiful feline and in danger of extinction eventually turn into an article of betment directed against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is therefore not a leaf on the Siberian tiger, but a leaf on the sequences of a Putin com operation.
When we expose ourselves to the media so much, we also expose ourselves to irony or criticism.
The perpetual return of victimization of the Soviet-Poutinian sympathetics.
Hollande had also taken the pear full of it with his camel without shouting in the anti-French plot.
Here our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg Saint Protector of the Great Russia personally and physically involved himself in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understood everything, he stopped...
Holland's getting low, that's one thing.
At first sight, it seemed to be an awfully condescending idea.
But on the basis of the article, it seems to be both an answer to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find something to say.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed the teeth before, and 73% later, it's a little empty sense to complain about paternalism.
After all, there's no problem brushing your teeth!
Indeed - in the end, complaints seem to be in relation to the fact that they are targeted towards the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if it's true, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants offered by the Department of Labour and Revenues of the Ministry of Social Development for unemployed young people.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a drawback to brush your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and stiff, it can sting the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember an issue on the Guinness book of records where someone had tried to brush his teeth for the longest time and the Guinese judges at the time had strongly advised him to do so because of the adverse effects of frequent and prolonged tooth brushing.
At first glance, very funny.
It seems to me to be a rotten experimental design.
The mere volunteering for this study will have changed the habits of participants who knew that tooth brushing would be studied.
That's why most behavioural studies include such things as double blind, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person who receives social benefits, there are two things that differ from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not give back information about when they brush themselves or brush their teeth (results easily screwed in the air by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Are there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including the uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not on genome, but on gene expression, and that these inherited traits could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterine graft impact this phenomenon?
The nesting itself resembles a sort of graft.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we do not want to be born of a perfect clone of ourselves, is this a priori a problem?
It seems to me that it is going beyond the limit of the reasonable.
The desire for motherhood and paternity should not move ever further, without the question of ethics, risk taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No. Medicine is not all powerful, it is not without limits and yes it is sad and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they want to have.
This has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the tran
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go to risk and manage your little testicles alone, all alone in your little pants alone.
to "confer" this magic bag for them to have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him in my safe if he could still give me love?
The current harsh circumstances make the PR FRYDMAN careful about his communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "we would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
What we're going to put as an anti argument: see here these male reactions all curiously....
Marjane, any organ gifts have nothing anodin.
I've been doing plasma for years, it's not completely anodin.
I had registered as a spinal cord donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understood for both the receiver and the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow to judge in one sense or another or take part in this gift, but I will listen to women to speak about it.
@Margane: In fact, this has nothing anodin, and it reinforces the act of love that it implies.
Giving a kidney to a family member who needs it does not have anything anodin either, and it does!
Please don't mix Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need that.
Especially since there's really no competition anymore...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
Sports has become a Yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second, but they don't have the standard of the League.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team.
Thank you for fixing me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Sports before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all the Real Madrid goals records this season so he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a quiet conscience...
It's hard for me to believe it.
I think Ronaldo will end his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was looking at him on a fucking connection, so I can't tell you much if it's not that Valencia has defended well and without counting possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid the middle of the field would get too fast, but they played well.
The game of Parejo overall becomes better.
A terrible penalty that is desperately demanded but saved on a fair basis by Diego.
A mischievous Mestalla's atmosphere and it shouldn't have been funny for Atletico's bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the origins of mummification", well illustrated, appeared in the magazine Archeology 524 last September.
It's good to have arguments to confirm and date what we intuitively think.
It's not surprising that before it got complicated, it was simple.
All science progresses in small ways.
And the "organ" of the woman who was thus preserved was?
Passionate!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me to read a few days ago that a mummie of black children had been discovered in the current Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, especially geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mummie was prior to 1000 years to the first African mummies known).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you in advance.
She's a little uncomfortable with reading.
These may not be contaminations of modern times.
Was the desert at the time not going any further than now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis pushing to the place where there is only sand now?
We knew the song.
And it is enough that a European scholar, even without any evidence, affirms it to be a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it is not and always "from his ill-known foretastes."
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal quacks of the free market and which preaches against mobility of persons and for the mobility of goods.
I think that there are other people who are affected by Ebola and who the Spanish government is talking about, so as not to give themselves a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same with regard to tourism, but right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect business interests rather than those of people.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good for nothing and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very touristic place, I doubt it's their biggest concern.
What are you expecting?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that enable millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say, yes, it is important.
If they had absolutely to return the missionaries, I don't see why they could not have sent them to an air force base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had the task of dismantling the Spanish health service by privatizing nationalized hospitals, especially in Madrid, which is its base of power, until the courts intervene.
It's nothing but a right-wing in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's fucked up in the next elections.
To be just towards Cameron (I know it's not easy here) he's socially far from his right and would find his place well toward the religious crazy right in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had previously descended to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European party right to the Spanish right.
These are cases apart, believe me.
The Spanish government is talking about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not succeed.
Excellent article but above all fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE employers - SMEs seem to read Le Monde to take the time to condemn Mr.
Let's move on the anti-intellectualism of the ambient era.
A professor of law at the College of France seems not to be able to know the labour market unless he is a Nobel Prize in Economics and proposes to liberalise it completely
It was so much better before, it is true when Dr. Villermé saw the work of 8-year-olds 10-day-olds, when the Canuts were getting caught up due to a collective agreement signed.
Oh, good old time.
Your reaction is just as fascinating because of your ignorance of TPE's employer trade!
His job is not to know the law in all his bosses, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts on my youth salary bulletin, more than 100 information today!
Here is an example, one might mention much more, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, imposed without measure of consequences, and which choke the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbon client.
To deal with the archi-resassisted argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code in relation to the helve, a serious academic would have plunged into the Swiss texts and would have compared the amount of official texts, and then to the comment (the absence of the latter which may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By comments in a Code, whether it's work or not, the case law in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for enforcing the laws when a employee is fired, for example....
Who's complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, jurisprudence, agreements, contracts) are in relation to work and trade of unbearable obstacles?
What's he doing?
How long does that last?
Pullmann "Art has practically been immunized against criticism Mrs.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It is certainly time for new revolutionary absurdities to turn the criticisms...
For every article about Ai Weiwei I've read recently, you are one of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Move on to something else!
Go see elsewhere, the choice is not lacking in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists that are not spokespersons of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a Chinese government troll.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokespersons of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokespersons are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think that the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraud, this is what you miss.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but I had to expose him (without making a bad pun).
It's the guy who pops off the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it the art, right?
There is art, and then vandalism is seeking to attract attention.
True artists make a difference.
A beautiful artist.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy to occupy an elective mandate for extremists from all sides (including Zionists) must be removed
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which led to several judicial convictions, shame both Israel and Neuilly's mayorate.
He doesn't represent either.
Philippe Karsenty is fighting the truth alone, marginally.
WHO BECOME ASSEMBLY
What does Neuilly City Hall have to do with Philipe Karsenty, an abusive journalist and his family, and who publicly calls on him to attack this urbanist?
Crime apology?
I can't find Neuilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges??
This guy needs care, like Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the anti-Jewish/anti-Israel conspiracy theory and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most furious detractors.
As many people believe in any political decision to see the hand of the "sionists" (the term whose meaning tends to disappear, because of its abuse), these two, in the same way as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe in any criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism "that is not without recalling the darkest hours of our history because it is still fecundating the belly of the beast my good lady would be believed to return to Russia from the 19th century!".
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the plot on the 11th of September are of a severe stupidity.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the conspiracy theory of September 11, we talk about cognitive dissonance about how to approach the subject.
Totally blinded by a totally tedious truth, having spent too much time, spent too much money to support it, it is unbearable to the adaptation of this theory to separate itself (as in the case of extreme religious).
It follows a logical and inevitable flight forward, the end justifies all means, even the lie, which is a comple, but comple does not seem to disturb the mission of the person concerned.
You advise to be careful and not to put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you do for September 11.
There is still a flurry of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudiens/consorts do not seem anxious to answer it.
There are really very tedious theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need even more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its hour of judgment where the real harm it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is rising," but what (a little) requires more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you think this is an attack - are you going to have a drink and relax?
It's better to risk that than to put my mental health at risk by refraining from me.
The government ends the fun when it costs him money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two average drinks per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first citation seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second implies that it is more or less safe.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Council for Health and Medical Research should be in consultation (around one or two drinks, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now we're going to tax them thoroughly, like the smokers!
They already do it - soon it will be grass!
My father didn't drink and he didn't smoke, and the cancer took him to 64 years.
So I'm going to continue drinking my two bottles of red on Friday and Saturday evenings (and the other nights when my wife isn't here).
Why is it that the Cancer Council encourages children to go to places where alcohol is used It is an old time that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a risk of cancer these days???
Sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
I refuse to run when we can run and reciprocate.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessed-yes yes.
Both of them destroyed the F1 on security grounds.
Let's hope it gets better than Schumi or worse than Wendlinger did in 1994.
Absolutely agreeing with you, but attention to point 1: it is not the F1, but the instances of the circuit that refused to advance the departure to not miss the TV broadcast channels.
Totally accurate, +1
I would just like to wish a quick and quick recovery to Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, incidents that almost occurred between maintenance cranes and f1 were cost-free warnings.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, had said so for years.
How the hell did the race organization and the AIF allow these maneuvers without leaving the safety because?
I can't accept that we invoke the risks of the trade or the lack of luck when we haven't prevented the foreseeable.
But this accident was.
It must also be said, however, that there was a yellow flag, which not only means "a ban on overrun in the area" but has the first purpose of pointing out a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunate for the family that was supposed to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just raise their feet.
Under changing conditions, turning can be much more abetting the next round and the pilot, believing to arrive with sufficient margin, can even be "reduced" at a speed compared to a normal rhythm.
But, well, we cause in the void there, until we have seen the images, we can't make an opinion.
I don't see much about what this changes.
Are there any wounded?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the info this morning before this happens, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe there's still jobs where we have to be on duty 24 hours a day.
I don't think people are hurt because Canada is almost empty.
There may be wounded animals like bears, raccoon washers, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population densities in North America and Toronto has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan countryside, trains do not derail like by charm and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains parade very, very often in one day.
In addition, as roads often follow watercourses in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass through densely populated areas, because people always want to live near water.
Also, all rail traffic crosses the center of a city as it was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is enormous potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge made a story about it last night, really shocking.
Did you obviously not read the article on the derailment and explosion of a train in a city of Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city well before the railway.
That said, when the railways were built, they passed through the center of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the National Canadian Railway Corporation are expected to attend the next Hazardous Products Conference in Calgary, Canada, on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees are long trained in the transport of dangerous products.
This article, like many comments, is impasse on the primary religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there cannot be other truths.
The whole problem is there and the exegesis of theologians only reinforces this fact, or what good is there about the sex of angels?
"God said: it's good - it's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).

Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in a certain way trying to form a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the strong Euro ( rather a milestone at the moment) or that of the free market ( which is clearly supported by the state when it is to reflour ) ,etc .
Great ideas from religious backgrounds.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is tow and expresses itself in the schism.
Religion was born as an ideological support of the state, and the gods put in service of ambitions even though it also carried forms of contestation.
Theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to air of time knew no doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a bad interpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts which are filled with explicit appeal to the hatred of the unbeliever.
Rather, it is the moderate religious (and fortunately they are the most numerous) who "read the texts badly" and retain only that which falls within the realm of humanism and common values to all humanity, atheists and various believers.
For me, fanaticism is the stupid and wicked application of passages of sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, certain verses of the Qur'an calling for the killing of "believers", "unbelievers", "hypocrites", "judges" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if one does not read a few verses above or below specifying that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a legitimate defence situation.
on Yves Petit:" concerning the "foulard", it is a religious prescription that makes today almost unanimous in the "savans".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to get out of this is that it caused a general conviction.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same damage as the one shown in the clip?
Band of Neanderthalians overpaid and hypersexualized.
They have blamed humanity enough!
What did they bring to us frankly with our neighbors, for life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Tasmanian Devil and this satan Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take your eyes off TV for a moment, you'd see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and stone made by its native peoples and are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
The Australian film produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealander, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me be of another opinion.

His articles are cruelly missing.

We leave him for a month and when we come back he's in debt the same salads.
Almost all of the 331 dead since the cease-fire are civilians of the Donbass who have been bombarded by the army, due to uncontrollable elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritically suggested responsibilities in the article without daring to explicitly designate the separatists is in the otanesque line of the World that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the pro-European neo-Nazis bravely facing the wicked Russians

I open this page very well on firefox and mac.
If I understand your words well, the wicked are the Ukrainians and the gentle Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a little communist by chance
Extract from the (very long) document you quoted about MH17: "this ticket does not mean that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent."
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said Ukraine was responsible.

ALLEEEEEEYEY TO ROMENIA!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez in Hungary!
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That said, I can't stand the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the authorities in place who has not stopped disparaging Romanian football until the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperative", which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, who would be relegated, and who would whiten the money at his own will, mainly by selling players who were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, did business with the above-mentioned officers, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about one million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was badly advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have earned him a sentence without a penalty) and took him as a result of three and a half years of imprisonment.
The trial also came from prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, star manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali also carries a penalty for trying to bribe (and then conceal the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final game of the championship, to win the title and win the championship league jackpot.
The team he tried to overcome were our neighbors from Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 at their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were relegated.
I'll always enjoy this time so much.
In the concealment of this attempt of corruption was involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed a false document as a witness that implied that the money the police had seized in Cluj was in connection with a sale of land.
So this poor uneducated guy, idiot, cheater and liar doesn't represent me, and he's never gonna do it.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalists today.
You might think that after the last time they broke chairs from the stadium and store windows, and where they branded racist banners in their streets, they couldn't have tickets this time, but no.

If Sarkozy had done that, we would have heard the left screaming like a big sick man.
But since it's the nice Hollande, friend of the unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but it's all low.
That is why economics sometimes prefer a left-wing party to settle in power.
It's the bankers who funded Obama's victory, and they didn't depend on their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers do not seek work" LOL (no comment)
Is the employment policy expected to generalize the control of unemployed early in 2015?
I hope that in the whip, the tax pole, will also generalize the absolute control of the gougans commonly called Plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrates, tax evasions, stealth patrons, and other Malandrins.
Can you make a sentence without the words banksters or pluutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
It's true when we have class: we treat the population of lattice and toothless
In each new period of unemployment there are dozens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who most often do not even charge a receipt charge, it has been automated.
It is also the total lack of follow-up or support from the Pole Employment.
In conclusion, I will add that this government's "socialist" patronyme appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Did we read here an article of the duck chained?
It is learned that a unemployed person may remain without news from his agency for several months, but must continue to seek employment through his own means.
It is learned that controls have allowed people to be eliminated who for more than half no longer had unemployment benefits.
So we wonder how we can control people we've never seen.
It is wondered what sanctions are for people who do not have access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if it can be admitted that this reform will allow for more radiation, one wonders why it will help recruits.
"It is learned that a unemployed person can remain without news of his agency for several months, but that he must continue to seek jobs by his own means" It is indeed shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Isn't it as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in football either?
Should we chase them from the EU?
The EU was only economic in origin and should remain.
The goal is not to be a "thought police".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It has no economic meaning.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality???
The teams in Eastern Europe are constantly being held by the arbitrators of the corrupt mafia that is UEFA.
The best solution would be that all East is leaving this lucrative organization rot and created its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This anti-racism crusade is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Currency and trade, rather.
European ideals of equality ?
So what the hell is Europe letting the United Kingdom in?
The Uefa should applaud them for jogging Blatter's comedy and his men.
It's been happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Pulled from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he expect to be reversing small symmetrical phrases, just history of maintaining the controversy?
In any case, it is a fact that in every small event towards peace, there have been, and there will be people working to cast oil on the fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli, and that only explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoding would be to say that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, it would be necessary to act against the overarmed Israeli state occupying under the siege of oppressive colonial destroyers
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was not at all in the Shoah, it would have been more reasonable to empty the Bavarian Germanic inhabitants (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been fair, the Germans had nothing to claim, and Europe would have kept millions of educated, enterprising and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr. Let's take the example of the settlement of Western Sahara...
Let Morocco be the colonialist, it's obvious!
But it is necessary, as for Israel, to question the history, its allies and its support for the truth.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
So stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaul was colonized by the Romans but at present there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is good discrimination based on origins.
Moreover, the Israeli state is defined as that of a "Jewish people" whose non-Jewish people can not be part of.
The Israeli state discriminates against non-Jewish people, hence the content.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, we must break with Zionism that opposes Jews and non-Jews.
In Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized in the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that need to cease to be ignored.
First, the Zionist European project (colonising the ownership of Palestine) involved the plundering of Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needs to be broken with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay missed biting from the start.
Their terne result will give them what their fingers bite.
He should begin his rehabilitation by small plugs.
I hope he hasn't lost the appetite of the game.
We tolerate so much subtleties, including racial injuring and physically hard heels in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what the Purists say.
Yeah, I hate all those molars.
Football is a contact sport where the courts exist and, therefore, players get hurt.
Getting his teeth back into the flesh of an opponent to have the advantage certainly did not have his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for having done a similar gesture.
This is the third time Suarez does this.
If you bit someone at work.
What would the consequences be to you?
I knew someone was gonna die.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this two-ball sarcasm.
I bet he was looking forward to playing with his teeth again.
All these word games on Suarez are losing their bite.
I almost died of choking.
An essential condition for a good school course is the respect by the students of their teachers and the school institution.
This works if parents instill respect for their children.
Parents convey this respect more easily if they feel that they too are respected by their children's teachers and schools.
In good establishments, those who advance their students, parents are regarded as partners, not as emms..
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do the whole job (teaching, teaching, learning respect, limits, living together briefly) It is for parents to do at least 50% of the taf.
But it's probably easier to get to school.
Moving on parents is not operational.
No one really took on them.
The action will therefore remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could be a lot of things.
Operational and resident solutions.
It would be necessary for actors (profs, hierarchies and ministry) to play their role and not constantly reach out.
We can dissolve a force that flows away to relaunch it, not the families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the first role of the school.
Transmitting knowledge.
And if there is a parent's requirement, school is to provide education for their children.
What is the minister who will dare to put in place what is called the Public Instruction.
Disgusting article: little information, partial and destroyed reflections.
Did you really expect an intelligent comment from this beauty of the suburbs of the East?
It's a beauty, it's clear, but I think it's rather Willoughby, and so on the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Let him fall and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
purely true
That's right.
A little Aloysius.
His electorate is Sydney North.
A port of the North Coast !!!
Well, if British BBC viewers wanted to compare the neo-conservative governments of our two countries, they would of course come to the conclusion that both were led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
He's going for a grunt, nowadays.:(
Yeah, but his leader leaves him on a regular basis with his hunger.
If you wake up one morning and react to the fact that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these lawful and illicit benefits to life will forever remain out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He tried half to present a budget and then quit.
At least he doesn't threaten to beat someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and call for aid to the state.
And as she knows how to lobby, no fears about the result.
And so much more for employment in France which she has nothing to do, which emanates from legumers still ready to break when their corporation has losses on markets, especially outside...
This is precisely because their lobbying didn't work because the command was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the time limit or an arrangement for marpol, there is no doubt that the project would have been completed.
After that, to find out if it's good or not and how BF is going to comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice if "the world" leans on it!
The Brittany Ferries company is owned by Breton vegetables.
Those who burn the centers of taxes and drought.
They want state aid.
That they didn't seem normal to me at least.
And well to the extent that it armed a ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes it's normal to wait for a blow of the state.
Or then it is condemned to tolerate the fact that the British monopolize the market.
It's the choice.
The eternal French problem that views its maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where people sometimes live different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-lived.
One of the reasons why Brittany must regain its sovereignty.
This is and after they will create the Breton Pavilion with crews exclusively composed of pure strain brakes.
That's for sure they're going to bring down costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They always hated everything related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of "abstaining everything that relates to the prog", as they just broadcast an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career that would be "closer to the Genesis spirit of the 70's", I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a lot of Genesis songs on which he has had various degrees of participation and claim to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour does not have the right to collect a lot of half finished demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett is asking for nothing but a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely great, and in the mind of Genesis of the 70's.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, be honest, she fears.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been realized if they hadn't had their commercial pop success in the 1980s?
I've still not seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have a story just as interesting but lacks the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good remarks.
I'd still say that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that she adores progressive music over time.
A person with a personal interest cries out "prejudice": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against the innocent), then it is a stunning success.
There will always be a difference in size between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his distorted understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so from the fairest and wisest vision and reflection of a society.
I mean, they don't have any excuses.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time ever.
That is precisely the difference, Mr Le Clos.
It is necessary to have the mind of the common mortals to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has done since his false sense of things.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, revenge in the relatives of the innocent victim: a distorted understanding that can never be taken for granted by those who decide wisely of the death of others since the healthy and just reasoning of their pedestal.
However, in an attempt to balance the analysis, it could still be argued that the death penalty, often, has exercised wild violence, which he has enjoyed, against deeply friendly people, who have made the cost free.
Those close to these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain attenuated with the disappearance of the one who was the assailant, sometimes the torturer, being loved and haunting their nights.
Let us not despise their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this thought that I find very fair.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he shows great intelligence.
The heart one.
That's probably what I've read more just for a long time.
However, we would think we would read stories of another era, of the old things, that barbarism of the past would excuse, and then here are the dates that close, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
The same is true for the other two "Great American Romanists" mentioned here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all overrun.
I thought you'd stopped the white one, man.
What are you talking about?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than this painful Bellow, who received the price.
Perhaps this year's Nobel courts decided that if we had to have an American winner, we might as well have a racist [light].
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "geny novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homonymous Joseph, on the other hand...
Which have you read?
How many books from DeLillo have they read anti-DeLillo?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, crazier, smaller novels and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'm gonna finish Underworld someday.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough DeLillo books to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...???
It's of simple interest.
It was a trait of humor, "law," not a demand for definition.
Between the text and the mind, it seems so EVIDENT here that the lady acted in SO only interest, and absolutely not in the institution she represented, that we wonder what the word "conflict" is going to do there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll be very expensive!
Yes, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not warned him of the danger.
After that, we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and are looking only for tranquility.
The inundable areas that become constructive from day to day the next day when a large construction program starts, it's classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at alluvial plains near the rivers.
We were told that "now, there are no more flooding through regulatory dams."
Now you have to enlarge the retention lakes upstream and cross your fingers.
But it will be because of state services, of course...
The profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is the interest clearer here?
Get out the calculator and you'll dream of life that you might have been in place of Mrs Babin, 1st Deputy UMP of La Faute sur Mer and former chairman of the Urbanism Commission, the one who gives them permission to build!
The two mammoths of the Sarkozysme triumphant are the old and the real estate.
I'm left-handed and not at all sympathetic with Sarko, but svp, not low political or low-cut all Azimuth, we're not in there in a battle of bridge balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. cops are hard criminals.
The US is a shithole.
So what kind of shitty hole are you living in?
The U.S. isn't a shithole.
Yes, the U.S. cops are hardened by the roots they're dealing with every day.
Of course none of them ever do anything but the cops "come and screw them up because they are racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the U.S., it is unfortunate that an incident like this is going to happen to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You're unaware of it here.
Good cops must expose corrupt racist cops.
Sell them!
Do the calculation.
This kind of open racism doesn't exist here.
Is this your first time in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant when in fact it's clearly you who don't beg anything - many sources (US resources) have noticed the perpetual problem of racism in the United States (that's not oissive speculation).
It is highly likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent to which the tension is increasing at the moment.
And therefore, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in different ways, from which Occupy's treatment there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and shocks me with the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think the research journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to question those responsible, talk to them, raise confidence.
That Man goes to Elysée doesn't really have anything surprising.
Then, what counts is the breakdown, the verification, the analysis.
And that's where we understand that sarcophagus has a concern to do.
@Monsstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of anti-sarkozymym based on business of any coin (a non-place and no conviction) that appears to have been concocted by magistrates(2 correctional references), two Dutch-friendly journalists.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, political, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, your partisan spirit blinds you!
RV with Hollande ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and unguided !!! ...
If you think that only Sarkozy's support is wrong!
From the extract I was able to read, VA's article only makes the rust grow.
I even laughed so bad it was rude.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chance of getting through because journalists are not "trained" in the secret of sources, are they?
In contrast, there does not seem to be any conniving between VA and power when there seems to be conniving between the power and the journalists of the world for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one to wait for an explanation of the world on the bottom and its dangerous relations.
We are well in the face of a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the government involved to fall.
That is why this editorial to the Aboriginal people, which says a long story about complicity with the current government.
It's not a left or right question, it's more serious.
I would have thought the bee would go well with the smoked herring!
It is simply for figures and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I was a second generation immigrant whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about immigration but that is no reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration program was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people who came in and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all co-operative, refusing even to give soup loaches simply because of the lady's religion, she also refused to enter her place of worship although she told him that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she wasn't comfortable."
As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go right - whoever imposes limits and contests it must be admired even if it is a director of the pub:) So much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left, it would be communist.
What do you think the New Labour has done, which is particularly left-wing?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS repeatedly, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms to well nourish the nose of the right in), the culture of social benefits, the age of the all-right, the politically correct that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is a center left and not a communist, I said this to joke, what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your arguments prepared as much as you want, but what I have asked you, are specific examples of Gauchist policy, or a left-wing program defended by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked for, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour did that was particularly right.
He gave you his advice, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah - it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants who now come to Britain?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to French!
It was beaten in 40 45 to fall into another gap, that of the money.
We'll make a lot of savings by going through these technocrats...
We should renegotiate the treaties.
So, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" has yet another meaning in Europe, should that do so?
Interestingly, the Commission does not consider the unfair tax competition between countries vis-à-vis companies.
This must be negligible quantity.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to market the rail transport sector completely.
In term, this means that whole sections of French territory will no longer be served by the rail.
The abandonment that has already been suffered in many territories will only strengthen itself.
To sacrifice everything, including the vacuum of a country, on behalf of the Liberal Doxa was not a good idea to me.
The EU is a real problem that will need to be addressed one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to make the SNCF accounts clear.
The French state has resigned for a long time.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but not the means of forcing the sncf to meet its commitments.
But using public money without waste is essential today where public resources are being forced.
And the enormous needs.
I don't see very well what the competition of the TERs could be!
Is he still having a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he certainly be head-of-the-sheep?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, still coming to the end of pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would make sense to start the process of separation between your life and the complications that you inherited.
Looks like it's what they do, but it sounds hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new surfaces are surfaced, have you thought of a "failure" plan so that you can make a break between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a bad effect, but with a compatible real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
It seems vindicative and persistent.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and to provide support to help her get back to work and pay for her maintenance.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My counsel, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice no matter what.
Tell them not to keep his promises regarding contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will handle disappointment if he does not keep his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see you do this for their good, despite your own resentment because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do all you can to facilitate a father/child relationship, they will know who to thank when they are older.
I believe that children end up understanding who is wrong, if they are allowed to see things for themselves.
Go another little effort you are close to the Godwin point.
It is folded, in 30 to 40 years civilization has disappeared, the short term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the iron pot.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that does in the least so-called social, fiscal, but also environmental, has an immediate competitive advantage, and the others are obliged to follow.
All the policies are looking for is growth, La Croissance.
There should be international coordination, but by then ...
Climanoscepts do not produce C02.
It is everyone who heats up, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in homes that he had to build, those who buy industrial products that he had to produce and transport.
It is not the climatoscopes that have shown against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climatoscope and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climatoscopes emit more CO2 than the others.
Environmental defenders also travel for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be sufficient.
Political action is also required (other sources of energy, reducing car dependence, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensibilities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is in fact a famous promise of McArtur made on March 11, 1942 during his departure in the Philippines.
Terminator only resumed the expression.
But good it may be humor to say that the expression is Terminator.
"The greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but any good apostle of the RCA dog seems to know what it's all about.
Nobody knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Bingo of the Guardian: How long before anyone blames for immigration?
I blame the crap that took all the money.
Do we count the Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm asking for my $5.
I blame the liars of democrats.
Or the crooks of Democrats.
Or the Labour liars.
We don't care, they're responsible.
The displacement of populations could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump in a car or airplane to escape the epidemic only move the infection faster than they can imagine.
Sex with monkeys is better?
You think it's a virus?
I do not advise you to apply for an order for antibiotics.
He hired Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse hired Ebola in Spain.
Damn it, actually!
Don't use the word immigration, you're going to scare the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their hygienic basins, to bury 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (do not forget your wool and your bont, which allows you to warm up, to extinguish the heating and to eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be such a jerk.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will lead Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a joke or is it not deliberately made?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is wasted to allow a small minority of individuals to spend good time in the space to make chickens and round while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
The television reality has thus not invented anything and the authorities certainly expect a baby to be designed up there to ignite the world and to rediscover the media coverage to the Western royalties used to the motherhoods of tabloids.
They might have to go back to the ground to see that they're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, you don't send men or women into space to do chickens or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for mankind in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily lives come from space research.
So yes, it's money spent handy.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily lives and results from space research.
It's just a frigid waffle.
the ball pen that works the tip in the air (for writing to the ceiling for example)
To pay for his treats?
To participate in the manufacture of an endless useless product?
Or propose how to make more money to investors?
In short, working for work doesn't mean anything and it represents emptiness itself.
Ah if the last plays high tech.
Behind the tiny minority of individuals who go into space, there are tens of thousands of others who work to make this possible.
You know, people who drink what, including more and more private companies, in particular to drive the cargo to the station.
If you think you're buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think they're buying plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy plastic gun in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to impress people to make them think it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
The plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, it would have hurt the author/editor to put a picture of the "sword" in question instead of generic pictures of "plastic swords"?
Or even be curious enough to wonder what the inscription meant (if any) that was on it?
Bad typical reporting, we're slowing down on the fact that "it's just a plastic sword" and not on the inspired jihadi text that's written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
The Dirani family, on the other hand, is Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups seeking to overthrow governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped arguing about the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be deadly.
Even the small blankets that are given in the fast remains can penetrate the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridicule the author gives it.
It is not worth trying to make a "ha, ha, a sword in plastic", the facts as you have stated them actually support his argument.
On occasion, I saw these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they had never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Sweet Jesus, you're right.
And it makes all the sense now...
I saw this guy who looked like he was from the Middle East in Kebab Stop and was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night!
I love the conclusion very much.
All the wonderful developments, often technological, suggest that many people think it is a right and a need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a standard cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that they weigh in the budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies leads to frustration.
For example, use the Energy Solidarity Pact, which allows for the isolation of the complexes of a house for a symbolic €1 when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are borne by the energy providers in fact!).
Simple effective but unknown even though more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting about this PES.
But he never heard of it.
Who can call it, and how does it work?
For information 60 million consumers, water-saving showers test and recommend the placing of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 / year to 100 m3) is 50 m3 of water savings per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
This is not a demand crisis, it is a system crisis that can no longer produce enough surpluses (which would have subsequently been redistributed in the form of real-time revenue increases) so that these surpluses pay the increase of the expenditures you classify as "restricted expenditures".
In other words, energy insecurity is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy can no longer grow as quickly as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is totally incapable of answering such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element that could increasingly force the pace of economic growth after decade.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what enables any physical transformation.
Since it produces, fundamentally, it is transforming, energy is a means of achieving less economic production (good or service).
And the more you want to produce, the more you need energy.
This means that any upward constraint on energy generation (i.e. "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn forcing production to rise (except to improve energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency always requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy insecurity and the fact that we are coming, or not, to increase the "production" of cheap energy.
And the very official data published, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only be worsened in the years and decades to come (the IAEA, in these recent reports, clearly indicates that in 2008 the peak production of conventional oil, understood, was achieved, of cheap oil.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job, whatever performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring things back.
Take this to France!
Vote No. 18.
Are you a Guardian webmaster?
As it was previously noticed: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Well, nice work, guys.
Although many English people like to mock Scots when they only lose, there is no to say, they bring a little color to tournaments when they get to qualify, at least until they get rid of themselves in the first round.
It's even more ridiculous if we play against them ;)
England is beginning to worry me.
Because now that the "golden shige generation" retires, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the 1 1 1 st, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class," is David Beckham, a little frightened, perhaps, but I think if he tacked a potato in excess like me, he would crush me completely.
People forget their athletic constitution, and talk about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I'm never mocking Scots.
I tend to surprise myself by looking at their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class," is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It's about which Juppe would have been wrong to ask for 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he would get them if he asked them...
You mean, people come here to laugh a good time?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, only lives on his deputies' allowances...
I ask myself, above all, about what he can say in his lectures.
How to reduce the deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious speaker of a scientific discipline, whatever his scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will not think of asking for a lesser amount.
Conferences with content are mostly free of charge or almost free of charge.
And I can assure you that these young people really work and that the results presented in their -free - conferences are real.
At the time of research budget constraints, the reporting of these two figures is upbuilding.
Researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
I mean...
It's all light for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the UMP ethics
I feel like he's being blamed for making money???
I'm far from being one of his fans, but he's being blamed for being ill (or fraudulent) managing his campaign OK.
But making conferences seems to me to be a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let's remember that her travels are supported by taxpayers.
Epidemiology Rule No.1: to be isolated.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than politically correct.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What density of population infection will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I'm taking the plane for Spain, and then I'm taking a plane back from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola is in the West of Africa, I can see them forbidding all flights and ships towards the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods that said...
What a shame that the international media panic about Ebola is no longer being used to talk about less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting West African people.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It's such a sad news article, a big headline so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (all too relevant): Women are the first donors of care - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc., etc.
Much more intelligent comments could have been made on how, why and where we can all contribute to better understanding and interpreting cultural and sociological approaches, and differences in the gender role that could help to combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's get into it, let's think and write, we don't just make noise.
There's a time for everything.
If you are unable to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, perhaps you should just think before you write?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same rank as decapitation - a form of terrorism as barbaric, its survival rate only makes it a different form of torture - to say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" beyond the meaning.
In fact - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give some degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case it obviously does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was "growing" as a global resource of journalism - advancing in the 21st century, abandoning his founding precepts.
Who in the editorial team lets it look like this?
For a territorial electorate or other money does not count.
I read constantly that the territorial civil service is increasing its staff, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
That would be legitimate , indeed .
There will probably be lies and truths, to separate the good grain from the ivy.
The Court of Auditors is expensive to tell so many economic naïserie.
It's true they never had anything to manage people on Cambon Street.
TCs are not in deficit they have financing needs that can only concern and only the investments they make.
It has the power to use too vague concepts in the press as the World plays the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial as it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, debt mainly finances operating costs...
And as the over-employment of officials (for making beautiful round-points for example) results in a growing and incompressible burden (compulsory charge until death, as living + retirement work), these communities are large in investment.
The status of staff member should therefore be abolished, prior to the decline in staffing.
Also responsible for the mayors financially.
It is fabulous that intercommunals should have been accompanied by a decline in municipal staff, and it is the opposite that occurs, evidence that adding one level is not effective without removing others.
How do you want to properly manage large territories like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse when these territories were created is revolutionized, perhaps it would be time to react.
They wouldn't prefer to stay in prison, worse encased, in the administrative canvas, they would look like!
Let's even try garrote, it's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the Veme state has led with its providential men.
It really started with Petin.
Then he went on to finish the series "at the end of breath" coming loudly about.
Why aren't they going to live in a 250 million-dollar apartment in Monaco over a movie to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, which will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the type "it's white man's fault".
"answers" not "answers"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry up to be the first one.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to get through.
We now agree that the Modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly wet period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence had stated a few months ago that no military hospital would stop.
So he lied.
It was probably the only government that seemed to keep the road.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
I quit!
in 2017:Transformation into a comfortable special hotel of golden closets for future retirees of the Republic?
Moving from the dedicated floor to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the nantis and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money and the military are going to treat the flu of the little one elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all horizons?
The London Wasps?
I pity their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They left London last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they go to Los Angeles, huh?
It changes that a football team uses the ground of a rugby club instead of the reverse.
In addition, outside travel for the Tigers and the Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had the trouble of being bought by the Salt Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I was gonna say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they had access to other premises, did not do us any favors.
I love supporting Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a lot of supporters and that was up until recently at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage resumed by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent CCFC issues, but this must be a good gif.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who doesn't do it except a few Wasps fans at work.
Do you and a few thousand other people in the south-east will probably follow them from a distance or will they now have to support another team?
Nice pro-domo article and good extension.
But who cares?
But then, why aren't all computer systems based on these concepts???
+because a huge mass of pre-existing programs (cobol, java), +because all systems do not require them, +because there is no magic baguette ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs aren't really important, which counts as being the first on the segment.
The work of G.
Berry's about a niche need.
Mr. Gérard Berry.
Such characters should be continually (the media) working for the good of humanity.
For children.
I know him.
Professor (retired) Mr. Noêl Dejean de la Bâtie.
The former director of law and political science has Rennes Mr. François Chauvin.
Professor Hugues Chabriat and his entire team of researchers.

But they don't sell.
Real-time computing has become a key sector in many areas, and few are those who know the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been to an Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There's already too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
It looks like they're reasoning with more profits, and not making healthier meals and the best price-quality ratio.
They take us for pigeons.
Oh, yes, be careful that people don't have too many steps.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you have to add to pasta water is negligible, but it greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It's not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way it cooks the pasta.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Each should try alternatives to business cuisine.
Are there family restaurants and are they offering tasty meals at reasonable prices?
What happens in the United States is very sad.
A banal job accident that went wrong.
A promising young man, trained as a thief, was following his father’s career in prison for murder.
A man has spoiled everything and brutally interrupted this vocation of birth.
Being sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where are we going?
I totally agree!
How humorous!
The desire to discover it is obvious and hardly excusable and slanderable at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to cut them off is hardly excusable.
That's what makes me a little sympathy for a 15-year-old boy.
During the trial the child's father complained that he never saw his son again, but without apologizing to the relatives of the guy he himself killed.
Who's really the victim of this story?
What do you see mixing everything!!!!?
The kid's father was convicted for what he did.
With regard to the bullshit of the lost bullets, the accused and guilty, he knew that the bullets were dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the accused!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible for!
Ten years, that's a little bit in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot this young man to make noise?
Well, actually, that made noise!
If the occasion occurs, go on vacation in the Mosule Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winegrowers.
That's twice when I do it, wine, landscape and food are great.
Moreover, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals that are held in each municipality, it is even better.
Sorry, the Moselle Valley, I hit too fast.
It's nice to see that German wine is recognized.
Rather important, German vinedressers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations do experiences with different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
There is no such thing as the Moselle region to be recommended - the Franconia, the Rhine Palace (Pfalz), Baden deserves to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are German-style (or perhaps the reverse, in brief).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot, and with a much higher alcohol content than their 9 preferred degrees.
But their traditional wines put in a bottle at the property are so complex, the sweetness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Volllrad spatlesis with a lobster thermal the next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine of Hugh Johnston is a good guide, superbly illustrated.
I understand that there will be new Guardian readers who discover the wine, but this is a summary of every newspaper article on German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article on German wines that are coming, the new drys of Baden that will now accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drink when they were young (heu, I really don't think it's always true or evocative, except if I address myself to over 40 years - who, as I say, will have seen it all).
Closing the Val de Grazie would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the unfortunate state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-grand uncle who did their studies there.
In democracy, public health management should be put to the vote by the Chamber of Deputies: these telephonies of ministries held by the barbichette, and those decisions taken in private, became unbearable.
Sorbogroin's right.
It should be done as in Soleil Vert: euthanasia at 70 years of age.
Moreover, we could resell the meat that will feed our poor assets (sic) because they can no longer go to the market.
Actually, find work for our unemployed, real work, and you won't have any deficit problems anymore!
For the elderly, time has come to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, when they disappear, will not be able to keep this demographic transition alone...
So of geriatrics, of course, but to think otherwise of a hospital model of the 30 glorious.
Now, the maximum growth to 1.5% (this has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole model defined after the war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that is known more in public hospitals.
If that symbol falls, we're really screwed.
First we fucked because the rest of the hospitals aren't high.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are being treated elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more likely to increase the supply of public service in other hospitals than to maintain a two-speed medicine.
The Val is a landmark of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
The closure would be a mistake, a sign of more of the march towards the mediocrity of France.
Not to mention the military status, which must be kept absolutely.
"The Hospital Day Award", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Ministry with local oversight of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is just one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia for a better job than he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country to two non-citizens is almost always non-citizens.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious hard consequences.
Why?
It seems to me to make two measurements.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all the persecutions and abuse and war that drive the people of their country to flee and force them to seek help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then we have to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I don't have to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country returned to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron did not believe in this small supermarket when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and the abuse that still took place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of Tamils with links to the LTTE, thinking that they would run a risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its guidelines for the assessment of asylum applications in December 2012, and recommended that persons with TTAs be considered at risk upon their return.
The year [2013] saw a rise in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr. Nowwak, he's gone with so much periodic coconut.
In fact, this guy couldn't get any chance to make it.
Did't I have a health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given every year.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expense during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes tera.
Especially in Texas
Ah ah ah!!!
A short time ago, we were told that the Ebola kills so quickly that a large epidemic was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the question, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of returned persons was zero.
The weirder we're feeling, the more scared I am.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Weak or even three weak but not null.
Finally, this is a scientific fact, the more a virus is fatal quickly (generally) the less likely it is to spread because the death of the host marks its own death.
The combination of 2 (high transmission and fast death) sometimes comes out of the Spanish flu.
After that is the 40th general to save humanity..
Is there not something oblivious to mediating certain brave and virtuous Westerners, but to the detriment of the thousands of other African sick people we know neither the trade nor the bravery nor the virtues?
Of course this highlights the actions of NGOs and encourages them to help, but repeated announcements are of terrifying bias.
Freedom of expression, so loved by conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms attacking the freedom of expression and the right to privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their captivating conservatives would have robbed them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, fewer health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heat tower for when the problem will actually become out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy of medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Market Fund for Medical Research, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be just an emergency black box for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, he will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope that Australian voters will come to see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe.
He explained that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Term Market Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly, and a loss for the low-income.
Maybe he's very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, he was given excellent tutors by the "loafer" and his Telstra Final Market Fund.
If it's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell for the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", delightful....
I also noticed it, pretty corrosive as I noticed.
If only she could dissuade her from keeping a buzz on it constantly.
The worst fate for a career policy: not recognized on the street.
Hello She has not been recognized in her city of Toul as being sufficiently high to administer it.
How good is the common sense of "provincial"!
We live in a hate time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course I'm against the port of burqa, but that's not the question.
What this anecdote tells us is sarkozism in the pure state: poor tiny ministers, confusion between the government function and the execution function (if Sarkozy could come with his toffee on each axle of the road to show that he is well-guarded of the public order), the severity and carelessness brought to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "old personalities" who have become disappointed to carry a firearm and a badge, so that they would enjoy their self-proclaimed function of justice.
But who is Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned Sarkozy's page, perhaps they do not regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets awkward for him.
I send this agent who didn't know Nadine Morano's existence, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the moment
Don't agree, thanks to her we're making fun of ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, she should be invented!
It's easy, though, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
On that occasion, N.
Morano manifestly did indeed in contempt, in contempt of the police officer she had before her, and who would have had to multiply the curves and the "Yes Madame, of course, Madam, at once, tell me in which direction I must run to grasp without waiting for this veiled woman."
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians has become too important..."
The Americans are not bad at this, but I still think that Isis will overtake them or have already done it, in Iraq at least someone was counting the bodies here no one does.
As for civilian deaths on an industrial scale, nothing rivals the Western war machine.
I do not agree, the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between the two Iraq wars would have cost millions of Iraqis, especially children, older people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war demonstrators I knew preferred sanctions to defer from the "war machine".
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred the sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good remark - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and inconsequentially in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - no doubt a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may recall that the insurgents did not waste time to mark their main enemy when they saw him in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the United Nations Mission GQ that they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with strength and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and harsh this bombing either, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission has been targeted like this.
Good point, I actually forgot that.
So add half a million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with recent disturbances in Ukraine the economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
It doesn't help your argument but to exaggerate statistics that are notoriously unreliable.
The only vaguely reliable figures on sanctions-related deaths are those of children under 5 years of age and they are even very suspicious because Saddam Hussain refused to allow objective inspectors to see the facts.
It was obviously in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable feel that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are not better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths in under five years was approximately 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, the number of post-sanction deaths may be largely partial to this age group.
Of course, we need to fear it, but also the gift of gametes in general.
It must be stopped as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that children needed, and that they could be done with strangers that neither the parent nor the child may ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French make genealogy.
It is an essential and despised thing to know its origins.
Instead of making it as if it were obvious and using fantaistic arguments, we should explain what serious problems can arise for an adopted child or designed with gifts of games.
If you learned that the parents who raised you did not provide the gametes you were released, you might return them to me because they would have committed no crime.
The latest advances in LDCs (e.g. Utrus grain) are at least as debatable as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me: the frustration of children's desire justifies these acrobats and that has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Just like a point.
Clearly, we have to fear the GPA, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad that you can't have a child when you want one.
It's a problem I've had with my wife.
But anyway, it is less serious than to be born very disabled or to become disabled, to become seriously ill, to lose all of his children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life, it is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
This does not stop us from living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer bears any form of frustration, where the child becomes good at consumption, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
Child desire is not a whim where one could use the other according to his or her good will.
Sterility calls for reflection and acceptance.
