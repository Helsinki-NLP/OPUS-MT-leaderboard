The populist right-wing triumph in Austria, together they form 29%
The elections ahead of the Austrian parliament have led to the first approximate results, a significant weakening of both parties in the current great coalition and a significant strengthening of the populist right party.
Strong and special losses have suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the current President's position, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carintia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent votes, thus losing 5.5 per cent of votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still has finished the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the people who convened these early elections.
Even early in July, when the PVO left the coalition, the people had a significant advantage in terms of preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters were punished for letting the government shipwreck.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party's president and, until today, vice-canciller, Wilhelm Molteerer.
The observers believe that this Monday could be achieved at the exceptional session of the party's presidency.
Such developments would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point for electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties on the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same would be repeated in 1999 when the people negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 BZO broke down) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction on the part of the European Union.
For this evolution clearly betting Haider who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and has already assumed his return to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and has fallen from the third to the fifth position among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can get cold
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illegally picking up beetles, one could get a cooler of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was expressed by the minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this were not solved then yes, then it would certainly come to this cooling," he noted after the meeting that was organized on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get in.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempt from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter rests.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest authorities.
Then you can request the exoneration of the case and wait for the judgment to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises appeal to the High Court and then it would be possible to pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can get into the matter is by obtaining the convicted a "legally competent support", said the Indian minister.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already achieved by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as stated by ČTK, his colleague stressed that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a terrible mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister circumvented the answer to the question of whether he had received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I have received a lot of promises," he only found.
An arbitrate Czech fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, it represents Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and also to it the seabed surrounding it.
At the same time, the region is as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and Sea Affairs.
His boss, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
Rule this planner and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed still hides a world little known, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms so far bear the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The fund is larger than the land firm
Coastal countries today have begun to fight vehemently the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, these take advantage of the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is essentially the continental border that sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental border.
"Simplely, continental border means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is natural continuation of the continent under the water.
It reaches the shoreline of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred sea miles, i.e., pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continent's border should be delivered with scientific documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a number of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal assistance commission.
The commission has so far processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward," says Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide impact since it was the first that essentially expanded its marine domain.
However, New Zealand also achieved it - the seabed area that gave it the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e. almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pain in their study.
The profit that will be released from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their applications.
They can do so until 10 years from the time they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Where the continental border ends begins the region of the ocean fund declared by the Treaty as "common inheritance of humanity".
From here on, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not any gold mine," says director Mikulka stressily adding "that their separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and their regime defined by contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
This achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to exploit in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something greater than the former Czechoslovakia.
The background there is injured, it's something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be explored.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concrete.
He reminds us of a small potato or a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend relived the Golem.
During the liberation of hostages the command of German special forces was at the scene of action
To resolve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not performed.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the action of salvation, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, at the liberation site were the German army specialists as well as GSG 9 personnel, the federal police aircraft squad, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, also experts in the field of logistics of the technical welfare institution.
As the ministry spokespersons reported on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because kidnappers, given a violent release, let their prisoners go and escape.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany's help to use it as a local support.
"Thank God he didn't arrive at the time," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the raiders had kidnapped a group of travelers made up of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers became unknown until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the custody of the German embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress let a large saving package of $700 billion fail in the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected the Government's package to save financial markets by 227 votes against 206.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, it did not reach a majority for the programme with which disorder should be limited in the financial markets.
With dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked Members to vote, although the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened at all," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
The experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order to leave the programme in force, approval by both the House of Representatives and the Senate is needed.
Organizers record an increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, sales volume of travel bookings for the next few months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation the desire to travel the Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more in comparison to the same period last year.
According to the investigation by the GfK market research institute, the reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The results base are GfK figures that are the information analyzed about reservations in 1200 travel and computed agencies approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are travel reservations made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar above all travel to the United States are of high demand, the DVR reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost one third.
The German preferred destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the German regions.
Above all organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DVR.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculators for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with advance booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, comparing last year, went down.
My first October
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Balneario, the beer in jars of a litre and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A debut at a tent.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already used.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're barely in the tent, the photographers have rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very clever especially because I'm first time in Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to fulfill its function.
In fact, as a tourist in Oktoberfest from the north of Germany, my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume until this day was still limited.
But after reaching the Prado of Teresa everything is not so long.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seems to be getting side by side or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my frontal gets rare looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A muniquesa draws my attention to my apron that had dressed in the wrong way: "the left is single, the half is the virgin, on the right is compromised, behind is widowed."
Oh, God, now I'm slamming behind the left.
"Okay," he says laughing.
The others don't care much about subtle methods to flirt and wear hats where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time in Oktoberfest.
He looks like "gorgeous", which says with a very long "or".
He told me after he put his glass of a glass of beer that had just been drinking.
He put it right next to the burning mouth, most of them think that's a garbage bucket.
So Bob's one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock at night, health groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear in groups every time - suddenly they are always four people who bring the covered streets from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They come sober, return drunks.
You don't see who's suffering from alcohol and is on the streets.
"They are the ones who "can't anymore," gave me the answer to a health care answer to my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Accident victim identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that happened on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then he has been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey began to become a member of the European Union, European powers helped to penetrate the country's interior.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most interesting remnants of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the neo-renacentist style.
At least this is what the guides say.
The building is set to time the end of the platforms and is facing two towers, one for each corner, looking like everyone a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once you've passed the lock at the vault, there's no doubt what the greatness of the company was that this was the most western door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition of mastering the Middle East through this railway that was being cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
the British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station has collapsed and stood out of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the Eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kinikioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shakes, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmatic change in Turkish consensus
that has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium built shopping centers and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business costume - men and women - meet first thing in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I wore, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the Party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
It's not one case if it's not for one or the other.
He has to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask him, "can Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he answers, "does not want to face that choice."
He then points out a point that almost everyone I've talked to so far had recited me almost as a memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to the East of Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at the Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they be to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, largely, would be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man in Europe."
So there is not much doubt in which the continent must claim this fascinating country.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (September 11th) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent choir of young people, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for children under 21, but at the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, several of us were ending 20 years - we just refused to give up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changer of forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether they were accompanied or with a complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and to the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
Tod often told us to "let music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in the music.
That's all we have to sing!"
His blouse was always absolutely clear and precise, though never imposing, nor too flowery.
Anyone outside the musical screen, always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by anyone – otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sell one or two well-known war horses all over the world."
We'll miss you a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) states that "in 1946 economic history studies were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree degree, a master's degree and a doctor's degree."
This is learned from a note by Woodruff author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not totally correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vita" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew attention to me because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda Supersales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If your predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new monovolum has an even wider interior space.
All of this adds to refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and allow you to save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolum are numerous.
Among others, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics can be noted.
However, before analyzing the new model, it must be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced into the market.
Therefore, a first remark is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during 2008.
Precisely in Japan, about one million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean 17% growth in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which means 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish branch officials expect to sell 2,000 units of Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to palliate to a large extent the decrease in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the trade mark expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which means 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16 per cent drop.
Despite this increase in Honda sales it has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this Honda quota trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year around the world.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The Insight commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation in society is held in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its odds.
Its length rises to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axles up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with increasing dimensions, interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with engine 1.4, as the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - are an improvement in access to the rear squares.
And the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, opposite the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
There are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two 1,2 and 1,4 liter petrol engines.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine regime.
The first 1,2 liter mechanic gets a power from 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm to 4,900 laps.
This propulsor - which previously reached 78 horses - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propulsor, which in the previous generation had 83 horses, now becomes 100.
This 100-horse Jazz 1.4 achieves combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The bee cache that prevents collisions
To move forward in the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in particular, in bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Center of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the Safety Shield in four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of brand vehicles.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space in oval form that looks very similar to the Nissan Safety Shield.
But most important are the composite eyes of the bee, capable of seeing with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are up to two meters away within 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately translates into the collision prevention.
"At the moment he detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right angle or higher to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require keeping information or intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about memory gigs, not even megas."
This is the first step in developing new collision instantaneous prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan vaticine will introduce into the serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
Thiemble before mortgage
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid for injections, is not deprived of ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on garbage mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a nice and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the bad credit hotel... or the mess.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially your receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably their goal.
True, he has useful information, but little detail.
It is more a page for adolescents than a site for all the public.
What if the game is completed?
Well, there's a dream room in the hotel.
Something's something, because we're buying a better house and we're not talking...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disbursed $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in its exchange quote.
One week after an interim agreement was discovered, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9,9 % of regular Morgan Stanley shares at the unit price of $25.25, or a $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a 10 per cent return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of a price per unit of measure of 29 dollars, or 28 per cent above its current change.
Morgan Stanley's action lost 6,79% to 23,07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the bank holding status," explained Juan Mack, the American Group's CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he makes it go under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the bigger names of Wall Street to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought the participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wished to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities at 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20 % of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert within one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if they are sold with more than 50 % above the conversion price, i.e. 47 dollars more or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capitals provided by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance sheet and increase your liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group, however, refused to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have relieved his balance sheet very much since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, who saw its exchange rate down to half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on their debt took off.
This cost declined last Monday but remained at a high level, about 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of Wall Street's large investment banks after the breakdowns of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
To refound the republic around the socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, was the third that put a project to the vote for a new Constitution.
The mission was carried out as 64 per cent of the voters voted yes to the referendum, according to the official results referring to 80 per cent of the votes cast.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28 %, the 7% of the suffrages were null votes and the 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the more one suffrage.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the electoral centres and a count from a non-governmental organization had announced a comprehensive victory to the "yes", estimated it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night on Monday.
The " Constitution triumphed in a crushing manner " , he had assured Ecuadorians who headed the Guayaquil government, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points consolidating the " new socialism " defended by the President.
The draft Constitution implies the increased power of the State over the economy, with reference to the " development planning " of a country that essentially lives through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign companies and foreign currency sending their emigrants.
With the exception of Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of State, which may perform up to two consecutive mandates of four years each and will be able to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 people kidnapped have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been liberated by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good at their arrival at 3:30 p.m. on board a special plane to the military base of Al Maza, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported by helicopters to Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They find good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, the Egyptian Tourism Minister, Zoheir Garana, declared at the airport.
On 19 September these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in the hinterland in a desert zone at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they moved from one zulu to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Egyptus, in charge of the organization of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of shots took place, and killed half the kidnappers, the others fled," said this manager who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces were sent from the lightning unit to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces in Belgrade.
"It must be recognized that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the day the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted an alien on board a patrol, from which the kidnappers, of whom he killed six, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), an assertion immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Quiet majority of culture
A debate on culture financing is taking place in the headlines and is currently in the electoral campaign.
Better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or to national historical sites that die of hunger?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore it to only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in consultation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of the Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 benevolous persons regrouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy worry about searching history, preserving with little money piles of private files and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and leaders throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
By what time, a monument to history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian-Netherlands Fortis bank which is seen in turmoil due to the impact of the mortgage crisis on the US market: the three countries will support a total of EUR 11.2 billion to this financial and insurance institution which also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's economic competition officer.
Fortis Bank was the first to suffer from the crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves more than a year ago, so decisions taken with regard to the Bank can in some ways be regarded as precedents.
According to the decision taken in the early morning of Sunday, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its business, including all the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year of the Dutch ABN Amró.
The actions of the Fortis began a strong decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with their 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break down.
The company's actions on Friday alone decreased by 12 percent, which is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the actions decreased by more than two-thirds.
Noting the current prices of the shares, the total value of the group's capital on the market is about EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management imposed the sudden fall of Fortis' actions to the insecurity of the US market in relation to the approval of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, the shares already showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new director general of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors had nothing to worry about, they were not going to lose their money.
Among Bank customers so far no panic occurred, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the hen
In the United States, life and health insurance companies by seeing the data on the purchase of medicine, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which are used for the use of prescription data in all cases, and are linked to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the fox chicken" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription follow-up program.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance price and the amount of compensation for the customer's health status and if they think the risk is excessive, they simply don't make the contract.
They sent the customer to medical control and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the check.
Dick ten years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: with the client identification number, he easily gets the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half, and the program itself draws the conclusion on the client's health and illness.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of tablets to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is virtually incurably high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
They circulate numerous versions of the program, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has just something to do, although there are small difficulties in it.
Among the disadvantages of the program is that some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and for heat waves and even antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones are not.
Special companies were established to consult and process this data, which before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
The authorities are already obliging them to this, although they have not received a fine for the neglect of so far.
Some companies have also developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them with drug consumption data to obtain more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and it is increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and health providers.
The bill giving the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he has therefore developed his programme, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because if the insurance companies do not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, despite everything, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
Global Menu for Marseille
The European Union duplicates its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are reciprocally trading partners, this subject in addition to the other global problems dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today to deal mainly with nuclear energy cooperation.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, the member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, Senior Foreign Policy Representative, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase to more than one hundred billion euros, their trade exchange.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessively ambitious objective.
Thus they legally harmonized the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation conventions with India, so that also air transport can fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both parties condemned the situation of Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and hastened the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalisation round was also adjourned, although both parties have great responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will hold on to its energy and climate programme, that is, by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, as should the next year's climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases decreased by 50 per cent by 2050.
They also wished to hamper the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - it will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that French companies will be charged with a value of EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian editors to the international exhibition of Frankfurt's book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of Frankfurt's book awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square metres of the exhibition with more than 403 thousand exhibition titles and with Turkey as an honor guest.
He will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will follow a meeting with the print on the Room Struktur in Buchmesse's 5.0 pavilion: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors is progressively decreasing over the total of Italian production, in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire disappeared a year ago
the remnants of Steve Fossett's plane have been found, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The rubbles have been found on an altitude of 3000 metres, in the area of the Nevada mountain range of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have confirmation that it is the same as that on which Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance" said at a printed conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found either on the plane or around it.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a team of researchers has been sent that has identified the apparatus: it is Bellanca 8kcab's own, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of beginnings.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world's turn into an aerostatic balloon: two weeks alone.
Three years later he had made the world's turn on a plane and no ladders.
Among his records, also that for flying at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schematics with an original and well-established design with defined lines and certain angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the last born among the "compact" land trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Owned by the content outside traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompanied the launch of the Glk suv, available in the exhibition rooms Mercedes-Benz since the next 17th of October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented form of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a automotive brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulate in three different stages, which dominated the central street of Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the images will have the impression that the car goes out of the poster.
Later, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to recompose into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of motor communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is being played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys from whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Others Italy" group that has been following for years the Italian National and that, until now, to tell the truth, has never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fanatics either.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Trivenet.
De Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These in Sofia have been added a small group (times units, in fact) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night have been removed so that they are not identified.
The English fans are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, the Levski ones.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 entries for the party: all of them already with the names, so that they could be easily controlled.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: between what they had gone out to Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, no one who had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have rejected the ticket and also the trip.
The interior ministry now expects to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to those fanatics who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorder.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents not only the Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't set foot in a stadium.
Luckily!
But now is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others be added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way," says the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why "well-opened eyes" especially in view of the party of the National of Wednesday in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (information and external security agency, that is the secret service, which takes care of the problems at the stadiums.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the raised arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...."
This is Domenico Mazzilli's (unhappyly expressed) thought, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the position that he was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazizzli had been head of Trieste of public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazizzli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been shameful.
"I don't do the sociologist – add n.1 of the Observatory – the crimes are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
So far this group has acted well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the silhouettes to the hymn of Mameli: these too are not a crime, but if they allow them also to be of education...".
