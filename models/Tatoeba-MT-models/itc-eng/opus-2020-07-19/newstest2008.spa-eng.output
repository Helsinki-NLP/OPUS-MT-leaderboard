European inflation declined in food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the dizzying growth in food prices.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering - after 2.6 percent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the EU Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts only gave as likely a 3 percent - announced Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decrease, along with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "there is a need to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene later on.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, beat the record for twelve years; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation occurred in the euro area as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
Wheat-term contributions increased by 88 percent and soy-quotation has reached its maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching as early as last month the black gold almost 100 dollars the barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will fall from 2.1 percent current to 2.5 percent, but by 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, it is expected that during 2008 the ECB will double the interest rates.
Gallup foresees a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Democratic Youth Alliance has increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup has never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of the socialists.
The difference in the case of the parties' safe voters - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one-fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary seats: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Safe voters include one percent more sympathizers in both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point before - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believes the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population is affected by the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth of the population is awaiting improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, higher than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of Government rather than his functions, he did not perform well.
13 percent of the consultants trust or rely heavily on Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of the consultants.
54 per cent of the population do not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 per cent do not trust the President of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 per cent felt it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is now only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (by 33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation responded that they would participate, and another 20 percent said that they were likely to participate.
Comparatively, in "a general election to be held this Sunday", only 55 percent of the population would participate, and another 15 percent would probably believe their participation. Based on the current intentions of voters there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
Some 74 percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of education rights, 79 percent of the medical consultation service and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we observe these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintuplicated its prices
They maintained the average price increase of 16 percent of the market hypermarkets in the Budaörs commercial triangle, with the difference that this year has not increased VAT.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs commercial gold triangle the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than the one thousand HUFs.
As in December last year prices in food supermarkets had already been "disappeared", so there was no dramatic increase in the percentage compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the 9,000 HUF, today they cannot even do for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum and fish liquor remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast net, cloud and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also found a kilogram of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with two-litre redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even at the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with regard to Christmas prices last year, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent the prices in the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket to that of the cheapest basket this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest one last year and the most expensive one this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so last year's Christmas in prices felt the increase in VAT.
This process was precisely the one that destroyed trade, supermarkets visibly were unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of the movement of a product, he may lose a significant benefit in the margin that fits the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher than the value recorded in 2006 while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, as the highest price has now been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest has also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets more than 30 percent the price of consumer items of first-necessity increased.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, in the case of some first-needed foods, recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent in the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the egg case.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product which was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case, just a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, which can impose the drastic increase in prices even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the commercial gold triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers of the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, removing preserved foods by pallets.
On the morning of Wednesday, in the three stores there were large queues in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that inside the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because incomes fall below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals you save with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been reported in hospitals, primarily due to the improper application of antibiotics.
The conditions of hygiene prevailing in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overload of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the department-medical chief of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals it saves even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, an MRIS contagion has been diagnosed in the trauma department of the Hospital János.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital early in the year.
A serious car accident wound was discharged from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly after the infection with MRSA and since then there has been no significant surgical intervention by the presence of the bacteria in her body.
Up to 10 December this year, they have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents - said Karolina Böröcz, department doctor-head of the National Center of Epidemiology.
This means that this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has certainly been recorded in hospitals, but no information is available.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-oxacylin-resistant.
One third of humans carry in their nose the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, amygdalitis, skin infections, wounds) respond well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once it is applied excessively or improperly to antibiotics, bacteria that usually react well to antibiotics become bacteria that are very resistant to antibiotics and quickly become contaminated in inadequate hospital conditions.
They may cause serious hospital infections, such as injuries or septicemia first to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened body, to elderly or to persons with low weight.
In the opinion of the hospital doctor-director János, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where his presence is not examined.
Antibiotics resistant
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff care for them in rubber gloves and masks and there are the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients hospitalized are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but it cannot even prevent infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA's hospital infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of training and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the patients that carry MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals it is not fashionable to take microbiological samples.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most of the cases go out to the public when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the department chief-doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union strongly commends the application of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological tables.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is directed, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Taking microbiological samples is even less common in the case of travelling patients or in the primary care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Saving with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, they play a very important role in hand-washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks, but also in this sense there are considerable deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA was infected by drop-on transmission and direct contact between individuals, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately you can also experience – added Karolina Böröcz – that in hospitals with less favourable economic situation saves with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
In Karolina Böröcz's view, where appropriate prevention measures are carried out, fewer infections of this type are observed or the pathogen's infection may be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
Treatment of contact with MRSA is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is being fought against.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The program appears to be successful, according to the data provided, infections with MRSA show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and that of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of alcohol from the police commander causing a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the 21st District Police Commander has been made.
It may be excluded from the possibility of a drunk driver or in a troubled state who, since then, resigned commander of the 21st district police, who ran over and caused the death of a passerby - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, after the expert report on the case has been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of primary control of alcohol that had already been found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before getting behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station of the 21st district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle by bending to the street Kossuth Lajos of the 21st district, ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(This last fact, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the rules of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always yield the step to double.)
The translucent lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police officer resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is under the responsibility of the Budapest Procurator's Office of Investigation.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian finance minister János Veres and the vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and the environment infrastructure as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had already signed a loan contract of EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The loan contract of EUR 150 million is also used to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this target in Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later, by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the project of innovations and research at Debrecen University.
During the talks they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th metro line.
The agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalises with the EU the details of the Metro's financing, they will return to the subject which, if necessary or not to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the appropriations is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging fees for maintaining the credit at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country before little mentioned.
What, where, and those who buy on the even cheaper market in the EU, will quickly become more important?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments of ski slopes and beach cottages.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estates also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Russia.
Similarly, the capital of Sofia may be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, and could thus be a remarkable destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on Black Sea beaches and on ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to install here buy new or renovated buildings for a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old homes in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor is important.
The second category are chalet buyers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
They constitute the third group of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital buildings is growing steadily, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of buildings considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fuck and six percent Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the expert-level meetings will be completed on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world discuss the Bali Road Map, which provides for post-mission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Discussions on the particular issue between developing and industrialized countries are currently taking place.
The United States has already indicated that for the time being it does not wish to negotiate accurate figures, although it tends to reach agreement that compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020 the emissions of greenhouse gases by 25 to 40 per cent will decrease by 25 to 40 per cent.
Another major topic of the conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are prepared to provide material and technological assistance to countries that need it.
A further agreement was reached on aid to assist developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the Global Environment Facility of the UN (GEF) - writes "Piac é Profit".
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases by 20 percent to 2020, regardless of whether or not the "after 2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to commit to reducing even 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 per cent, including 15 EU Member States then committed to reaching 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent over the period 1985-87, which our country will meet - notes the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
It is very much at stake in Bali, since within two years the international climate policy agreement will have to be signed in the long term, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed by after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the international scientific association of the United Nations that deals with climate change, which obtained the Nobel Peace Prize.
As a result, emissions reduction would be delayed and an increase of more than 2°C of the average Earth temperature could not be prevented, which according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruited on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings of filmed actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: the special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These tapes made with mini cameras mounted on helmets are controlled in the general body of operations of Kandahar, then sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
It is already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been loaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by over 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "headquarters defense" and publishes videos of actions perpetrated both in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the British Community (Commonwealth Office) and multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The air force had originally loaded the videos with recruitment objectives, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence they also served to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This type of propaganda costs virtually nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans set up a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the tapes carefully edited and censored, the distributor also shows amateur videos, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers speak as much loss as possible, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with video games of shooting, which can be downloaded for free, called America's Army, where in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can be placed directly instead of the soldiers.
Tombola and pastelillo salted at the Christmas feast of the ministries
It does not seem very sentimental to the Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to fire in 2007 with pastelillo salt and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate their feast with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets - so amuse power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The largest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry's workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers and for the Christmas of the Missionaries will be invited to the families of the soldiers who are currently serving missions abroad, and a reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million to the holiday environment of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with regard to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred workers in the ministry, about three hundred and fifty are expected to be present.
At the portfolio party will reign a Christmas atmosphere, will also act artists and will be drawn from tombola.
The NAF ship cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Council for the Administration of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinners.
The rental of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers in one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA since we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of the Christmas held the dance of Lucía's day on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not collect anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to the [origo] question they reported: to attend the dance was not mandatory to dress or dress at night.
Health, work, and local government portfolios are being prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and party for its workers in their own building with a budget of HUF 400 000.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not wait for his colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year working meeting.
There are hundreds of 80 guests involved who - as reported by the press department - will take only coffee and pastry salad, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The local government minister, Gordon Bajnai, instead, will simply offer with his colleagues in the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development class.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas festival in its own acting hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget you will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse but also by the hour of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a reception of New Year on January 20, in the Ministry will not be held on Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and as reported by the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception standing, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief address by the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments reported to [orice].
In the environmental portfolio press department, they were unable to report on the budget of the ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering together
The League Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will form a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike on Monday which will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work halt will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as the rail traffic will be fully stopped and workers from the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be in a strike until 13 hours.
In the afternoon of Friday, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday, which will be held jointly with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Machine Union will also be set up to coordinate the actions of Monday.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will take a final strike if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their appeal to the strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda for Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only the law on public health will be voted on at very late evenings, or at best close to midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will have to be significant difficulties in transport: in the railways it will cease to work indefinitely, in the morning it may be that part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban bus transport of Volán companies.
At the same time, there will be a closure of half of the roads in many parts of the country.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly being updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for defined time.
Until the afternoon of Thursday the State Railway and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on minimum services, but when approaching Christmas parties, more and more are the people travelling on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours workers from the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, Budapest Airport from 7 to 9 am, will hold a four-hour strike from the LIG Associations of Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Teachers' Unions Unions called a strike from 2 to 8 hours and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of the Health and Social Sector Workers (SDTSS) who are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour strike for a two-hour strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal on public health reform and puts a new concept into a social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation which will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for advanced pensions, the possibility that occupations that deserve it may enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1: The risk of the Hungarian Guard increases in the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Capital Policy, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August this year with the support of the Best Hungary Movement, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from a number of points of view.
The company's "risk warning" is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of the ethnic tensions existing between the Roma and non-Jitan population of Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic clashes can occur".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - the representative of the research institute added.
They affirmed that this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Gypsys and Hungarians."
This aggravates the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, " significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially in relation to the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that, as of the autumn of 2006, there has been increasing publicity and momentum for the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups of Hungary and that since the summer of 2007 many organizations have been formed in the country that define themselves as "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the state" - they add.
They stated that all of this is done in accordance with the method which attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
It is not only to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but also to highlight civil society and the form of partnership in the case of these associations.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighborhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar way that for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Roma that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
In his view, in the last 17 years there was "Gypse Terror" in Bulgaria, however, the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to lively discussions in Bulgarian public opinion.
As noted above, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic confrontations that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will be their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning on the risks of the Political Capital.
The Research Director of the Political Capital Attila Juhász to the news agency's question stated: risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their warning on risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holiday days - that the coming year will be less - reorganizing the working days.
Even in the EU or North America, parties are not a unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national party, state party and holidays.
The holidays are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemerals.
Let's celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - this one above all so that they can rest those who spent celebrating the old year.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national festival on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrate the foundation of the State, on 1 May, the feast of work, on 1 and 2 November, we remind our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country, two-day celebrations are the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so often one bridge is made when there is only one working day before or after the party.
In exchange for the extended weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you will not be absent from work or school.
He is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in return for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public servants.
It is not mandatory, on the other hand, for companies and service institutions that, because of their function, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work can be changed only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24th life is practically stopped in the country, since according to the experiences, most people "punish" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with mid-week or weekend, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First the agenda will be changed around the work party so that later, for four successive days, workers can rest.
On Saturday, April 26th will be a working day, so that on Friday, May 2nd it will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the 23rd October party: on Saturday, 18th October, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year coming during the end of the year may rest, since from 24 December it will not work in almost any part, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little dissuasives to bitter your colleagues' lives
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never received, innocent lies that go unnoticed: they are all part of our daily Folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that may irritate others.
Tips.
Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that they've been looking for you from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
Why didn't you go on a date?
At best you feel it and try to fix the matter, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before we proceed to many interesting explanations, it is worthwhile to meditate on the things with which you can water down your colleagues' lives and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, an office tool or your phone and you can't find them.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your pen lost at one of your colleagues' table?
You don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they're going to be mad at you for withholding their things.
Don't grab envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they wear out before time.
You're whispering about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with who?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your partner's trust when he shares his deepest secrets with you!
Enter into yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even though others know the things about him.
Are you on sick leave unwarranted?
When you phone the office and say you're sick and you're unbearablely hurt your head, you feel bad or good, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; you think that others should do your work, your impossible tasks, your work at last.
Don't bother your partner!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to the office or something can happen to you, so you have to stay at home, comms, so your colleagues or boss don't have to face you the next day.
Tarreos, laughter, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but you get rid of him with the laughs of your colleagues?
Have you unintentionally heard a phone conversation that would have been better off not listening to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarres, songs, loud conversations (less you make them above their heads), palales, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not deepening at the moment in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Don't mention the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault!
Are you feeling too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
You don't see a comfortable jogging even though your occupation allows it!
Do not be disorganized, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so demands!
Lose interest if you want to meet public expectations
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning jam.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm going up the volume.
Change the rhythm of music and the previous tones adds the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays Zagar's Wings of Love song.
National musical life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks completely different this jam when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national little by little are changing the image and although again it is fashionable the rock style garage, breaks guitars, the national pop electro has shown: there are new features under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi as a whole until he began his independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, dancing electronic music and pop, he tried to win, when asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the set that in the beginning it was only in small clubs when the magazine won2 selected its first album published in 2002 among the 50 most important national discs, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of also selling in the western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his whole are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether they carry this label or not.
The set reacted the way it should react: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The recently released album, called Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
It is good the reference on the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album on the Millennium György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The record includes a real success of the mr2 Petõfi channel that lately transmits from morning to night popular music. This station took the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
For everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: what are you interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of selected audiences for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between receiving your music from the Hungarian and foreign audience?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has greater traditions.
Here not only the fifteen and twenty-year-olds attend concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that take place around them in light music, because they consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We don't compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and did his career rather than west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music with that of him.
Instead, we work as a team, rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we took another way.
hvg.hu: On the success list of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people heard Zagar's name for the first time in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and sell with these successes our record.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a chorus in the Gospel style.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of soloists in good voice from our own national musical stage.
Thus was created that choir of six women - i.e. Seine, Kitzora Edina, Jude Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was later baptized as Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song or the girls exactly like that changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the disc, we thought there was still something missing.
The chord attracted the song.
Still that night I recorded the song the girls later learned.
Everything almost came to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I needed the Divas too.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the concert and on the disc looks like the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing together and not more strongly than music, so the music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on the stage are located at the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They're in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute soloist papers.
The song also covers it, about which we forget for a while our ego, who from where he came and where he goes, let those wings, the wings of love rise us.
I would have wanted others to feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What did you devote more work to?
Zs.B.: There were more difficult pieces in musical composition than in mixing.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, little by little everything got to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already "solved" the disc.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A traitor bag runner risks billions because of its inferiority complex
Disloyal evil.
This is how your former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank, points out.
By him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself with his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
It has long been intrusive, unlike all the large Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He had a fragile character" he let himself be heard from his superiors, the same ones that sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's responses according to what French media translates, such as the Le Monde newspaper, is that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1,600 million euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
In the summer, it managed to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity already came early in the year.
In February some news began to be heard about the subprime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those who in the past had problems with payments and that these customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not have affected the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe him and he bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded EUR 1,600 million.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had faked the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even cheated on the bosses, even when the Eureka Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
Risk turned to benefit
Was he afraid he'd come to find out?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had won 1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to risk yourself like that?
My position was to work gradually.
He joined the General Society in 2000, right after he finished studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was handled in the amount of $51,000.
Two years later he was already Bolsa corridor assistant and in 2005 he became a stock exchange broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I would never win as much as the others did.
"In my first interview in 2005 I already observed that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But soon after my entry into the company, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll let you go.
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or that they suspected it rather.
"While he made money, his eyes were closed."
Only then came the coup early this year.
In one day it lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to erase all traces.
When Monday came to work, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5,000 million euros because of it.
And how did they manage to locate him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The corridor that has no vacation is a corridor that doesn't want anyone to look at his file" Kerviel finished.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of reaching 365 billion
The Ministers of the Czech Republic signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission yesterday, of which the Czech Republic could achieve EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Out of seven operational programmes will result in approximately 125 billion crowns for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be devoted to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state transport infrastructure fund that next year will have the amount of 90,800 million crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly-entered countries that use them less.
Twenty-year sentence for the former President of Nicaragua, the court ruled
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Appeals Tribunal decreed a 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 to the $100 billion gap (approx. 1,800 million crowns).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to move to house arrest on his farm not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back in between.
According to the President of the Appeals Tribunal, Ileana Pérez will rely rather on prison officials if they let Germany finish their punishment at home or return him to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German constantly passed government money on to a company's account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in fact, to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Germany created to fund its campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, although the most influential, calmly approved the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget heading, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but in it the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition is hidden.
It is important for the media and therefore they devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State budgets of the last Governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three shortcomings that by this year 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenditure of representatives that are not only pensions but also the social benefits that have already been approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first flaw.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit in the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the tax, tax and credit of banks, often without meaning, issued obligations with which they disproportionately owed to their municipalities.
In recent years they have managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy and other development networks that received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this appeal.
If we only adhere to official facts and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, goes through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which ČSSD is jettisoned.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to order the state finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the countries, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, into the former government.
We belong to nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years have not been filled with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon it does not change the retirement age and pension reform then it will be the end of any policy in this country and, to rule who rules will only be a simple bureaucracy.
We can, by exaggerating a little, say that the politicians who rule will be transformed into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal spending of the representatives' expenses.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want government politicians to become only officials, so we must be patient and grant to this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what is capable of obtaining taxes and fees, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
The Monetary Marking will receive more than a hundred billion dollars through tenders.
In these tenders banks underestimate the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will bid $40 billion, and then another $25 billion will make it easier for the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report to the customers of the business consultant Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action of central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions of losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what they are still waiting for when they decided to take this step," said ABN economist Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and will therefore have to lend more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, the London interbank rate used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," said Reuters agency, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
Criticism now emerged with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, they are artificial fires of words, substitutes from the solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my ideas."
Interested people can now learn about their varied views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
It is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that on the warming of the planet there is no agreement among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
The questions presented repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental advocates but against environmental activists who do not consider the relationship between costs and benefits."
From the same topic, Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people didn't get to change their driving license
Six hundred thousand drivers were given the date and therefore failed to change their old driving licence whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for the change so that officials from time to the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year's, hundreds of thousands of drivers are on the roads without the valid card.
According to traffic, it has not been changed mainly by those who don't even want to drive.
While the peoples are announcing a rapid decline in the change of meat, the metropolis offices are full of requests and the interest for the new meat has increased.
The City Hall calculates about 2,000 customers per day.
The queue is waiting for half an hour.
The new carné has not yet been drawn in Prague for some 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new carné lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their card and do not reach until the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid card will risk a fine from January onwards.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the breach with a warning.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine shall amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a fine may be received by a person who does not go anywhere.
They could allegedly pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderately fines of 1,000 crowns, at most.
According to the vocals of the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the driver's license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the meats issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of driving car.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalty for the constable detectives of Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided as a final maturity the reduction of sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives in the department were to complain about organized crime, which was going to fall, in the beginning, between 14 and 12 years.
Against today's decision no longer can be appealed, only through the withdrawal by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he is initially awaiting the judgement of the Court of First Instance.
In spite of this in other cases, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement of 19 people in the robbery and today the higher court revoked 16 of them.
Most of the charges of the accused were rejected by the investigation as they were invented cases.
According to the Senate of Central Bohemia, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid punishment.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The charge concerns criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft was concerned, their victims suffered serious health impacts, but they were also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without arms permits.
In the home register, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of almost twenty men in this process, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the case of Berdych are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš P at and Maroš Šulej, who for now have avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
A Child Change Account: 12 million
To change children in the maternity home, the counsel of the families concerned, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million awards of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each mother, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, one million.
The hospital offers as much as 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, did not in principle agree with Veleba's proposal.
"That demand we didn't approve, it's too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the expert's report that the counterpart asked to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a recissory value.
We keep in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostal said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň's family wanted, for every month that didn't raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the Motol University hospital in Prague.
The parents of girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress at different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better sustained by men even though they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women lead him worse with the trauma they are now experiencing and with regard to what happens today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the maternity home of Třebič last year, on December nine.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Verónica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered at the end of October to each family 100,000 crowns as compensation for the error in the hospital of Třebič that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured as liability for damage.
In case of errors, they must draw from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask the administrator for help.
The court so far recognized them a proportionately low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly of one million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polyvka lost the dispute over the Kingdom of Valaquia brand.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the Kingdom of Valaquia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polyvka was not presented to the oral eye today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will return.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polyvka's popularity," said Polivka's lawyer after the trial.
To him, in the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone sees the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us for about ten years.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that therefore I might also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Valaquia brand was first used by Polívka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about guiding him toward the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš was able to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From this comic source came a lucrative business and business from which Harabiš later created the Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to use his name and signed his passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polivka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polyvka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, among today’s broken parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polyvka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polivka and Harabiš, whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the realm, through Harabiš, came from the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an accusation against Harabiš and his society which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clearly might bring in the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We're in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polivka can introduce himself," said Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: past prejudices
Actually, I've never really liked Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its gear features were never special, the quality of the change box, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is in the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one, is much better.
This Combo called SW is a little more advanced and I already just think it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the space of the head in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi bodywork means in this sense, which I will not suffer before two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I'm going through the interior quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more design invention although the car already seems pretty elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained of short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the 206 model, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the measures of the body have grown.
In the Combi, there is a shortage of space in the head.
Suitcases in case of luggage
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
This must be valued as very accessible (thanks to the abatable rear gate) and a well distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that provide an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But we stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, the basic system has a capacity of 428 liters, which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the vehicle of the same type most sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, we find that Peugeot stays behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On a vacation abroad or when placing the child's carlet its value is critical.
But if I had to say something positive then I have to quote the floor that is pretty flat after cutting down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our test car was equipped with a four-valve injection light on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a strength of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth this is how it should look like a 1600 that looked down on the family five doors.
It is silent, it consumes little and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the škodas then it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was covered by a rag, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The car price is not for all pockets.
However, we must bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a 1400 injection light per 329,900 crowns, can still be found.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headings, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen cleaning, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but it's about the team's plugs in Fabian and it's going to get to a rather similar number.
Now only one has to decide which of the two marks.
Slovak students are not part of English schools
In English schools children from Eastern European countries are assisted, and so locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Europeans from the east for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between emigrants and children of natives are increasing in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak migrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and brocas among students have already reached even parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was nailing a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In his defense he said that the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two younger girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls gave him racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to leave him, he made us the master of throwing apples and pears, and then he took off his pants and showed us his ass," he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with the emigrants of Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are registered 70,000 Slovaks who came here for labour reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished, provided you choose correctly.
Sand and golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and all enclosed with shrimps offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of America's conquest.
Column called her, the most beautiful place the human eye has seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything he had of crime in the United States (and therefore forbidden) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among its guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings emerged, by wide avenues the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century ran.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar had its yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita left their signatures the world stars of show and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Abananese Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel National mix you up cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already of worship of the 1950s, to this day continue to run for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who arrived long ago have rustled between these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old neighborhood, has deteriorated remarkably, there is no such wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are metamorphose in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly appreciated by the lovers of the railway.
The sugar cane is transported from the vast plantations to the sugar factories by narrow channels in steam or electric machines.
His carriages for tens of years were not discovered and are now there, machines that operate and whose brother models in other parts of the world are only found in the museums.
Where to go?
The most popular place for most visitors does not change.
And for that, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in Hemingway's already mentioned farm there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The valley of Viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows on limestone rock lands.
Mogots, calice rock pellets and steep high rock in the valley's falls, and in its caves fertile lands are acclimatized through which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting any of the pure habanera mills you can find with your final product.
Maybe someone looks interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Old-fashioned city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Squambray saw, is a place so distant that in the 1950s of the last century there was no road to join the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built, and for that, neither was anything destroyed, for each person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places around nearby areas such as the Ancón Beach or the sugar factory valley.
The evening belongs to the House of Music, which animates the silence of the mornings with its music.
Baracoa
Small city on the west end of Cuba, some view it as the most beautiful one on the island.
That opinion is certainly already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the Colón Cross (this is actually a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with its own name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, puros, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Copper Charity, the Santeria, the African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, all of which could be filled many pages.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it once.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, the Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment were needed, which was influencing the march of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as expected, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country coincided with Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to pursue greater activity, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is to make it possible for the population that they can only start economic and security development," said the BBC Defense Minister, Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to American army data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew as compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in the Helmand province up to 60 percent.
The NATO countries have some 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which the fourth part is in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, the allies have reached the same limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
They ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly today, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I'm not happy to know what we have in the earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have a ninety percent of soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters agency in closing the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive?
Among the participating countries in recent months, there is a controversy as to whether all the allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
It was passively criticized, for example, Germany.
"Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the struggle demands there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
Sun sensationalist newspaper this week called the German soldiers vague.
"The Afghan rebels find out that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys fight," writes Sun in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where British troops played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
The government's debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each check the state must be 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to 842.7 billion crowns in September.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
However, early in December the ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns thanks to the improvement of the state budget economy.
The state debt of the Czech Republic increased by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months this year it grew to 40,200 million crowns.
Since June, however, there has been a decrease of 13,400 million crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economics confirmed its data on the debt of the early October state.
For each check, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could cross the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900 billion and the billion crowns," said the iHNed.cz server, economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, sees it as well: "We could spend the billion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation in the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But such a change I don't see," he added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and comes, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The state debt is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct credits or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal indebtedness grew this year from 38,500 million to 719,400 million crowns.
External debt has now grown from 1,700 million crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803,300 million z crowns since June was reduced by 13,700 million crowns.
The average government debt maturity increased by 6.5 years.
"The total inter-annual debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent of what is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated above all of the obligations where there is a 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the state debt payments and management strategy for 2007 it is drawn that the government planned this year to lend 159 billion crowns.
In early December, the ministry dropped the plan by 152,800 million kroner thanks to the improvement of state budget developments.
The amount consists, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91,300 million crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum planned resources for the Czech consolidation agency with some 13,300 million crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payments, 43 billion crowns for state bonds and 1,800 million crowns for payments from European investment bank loans.
He was comparing in front of a court in Jartúm today to have given a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan to insult Islam had been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartúm 15 days in prison and the expulsion, his lawyer said.
The British was accused of having left students between 6 and 7 years old to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was punishable by whipping.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based on the Unity High School in Jartúm in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with the attack on Islam and seduction, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children in 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the bear photo with the following legend: "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm sorry that he only asked the children to vote for a name ", it's only an " innocent mistake " he said.
Opinion divided by numerous students from the school teacher who describe it as " very attentive to their students " and " who never speaks of religion in class " .
Let us remember that the Muhammad name is also the second name most often given in Britain, written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules for the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement," said the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not predict violence for now but we enter a very difficult period," he added, pointing out that " obvious tensions exist. "
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika mediators, regrouping the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited by 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika had been responsible for a new mediation by the United Nations in August.
The United States and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this high date.
"Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on an increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found " , announced the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where these "last opportunity negotiations were held since Monday".
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given some of his regrets.
But he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade " belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Borís Tadic has considered that a commitment was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade said particularly to fear a " effect dominated " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
Journalists Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be " in consultation " with the West.
Bush broke an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference held by him on Tuesday to Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
It required that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with a view to finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old contentious point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them complete a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must put an end to their colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations to the peace journey they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would " attempt to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main pelagic problems of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things " .
Upon his return to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to making the upcoming negotiations "direct and continuous" and to making "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the end of his " vision of two " Palestinian and Israeli " States that co-exist at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this direction from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , says Prince Sauud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the D.A., the police aren't responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Like every time in this kind of event, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate General of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car circulated on Sunday, shortly after 17, Luisa-Miguel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but in patrol, and it circulated at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating lighthouse," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to travel on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young men without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left, after a failure of the marriage step to the right," the police said.
The alcohol control of the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (the front unfounded, windshielded, shelled) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " involuntary murder and denial of help " to the IGPN, co-coordinated with the Department of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the police, namely that this mini-tocycle arrived relatively quickly to its left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the rustling of the footwear on the floor, showed that both vehicles had been trapped in time for the police car to stop.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims have been autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, not providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious fault " concerning this point.
" This is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more research, on which to be very careful " required a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that exactly gives the scene.
"We went down immediately, with my allowance that is a nurse to the hospital, to try to cheer them up, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a police officer completely out of his mind, who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that the people present of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
Always according to this witness, the rescues arrived " about twenty minutes after the march of the police " .
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young men have been rescued.
The firemen arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed on his part.
The tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been interrogated.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police loaded and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, resulting in a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, male rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement collected on Monday the support of religious parties regrouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president " urged the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of emergency and the wastes they swore to in front of Musharraf " .
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
" Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court judgements " , the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president " no longer " after the establishment of the state of emergency, declared on Monday to the Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Information Minister also confirmed that the January elections could be transferred.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancy remains unexpected
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not expected, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterile tissue still have a failure rate of between 5% and 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalisation of contraception, however, allowed a better "domain of fertility", according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years is increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births in every ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple of every five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It would have taken more than seven hours of work in space to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel and indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its removal from the inhabitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapucciated" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts had released the launcher Discovery module Harmony, a thick cylindrical piece responsible for welcoming European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for the modules-laboratory.
But we have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a solar panel power production module weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to place it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module with a size of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which deploys as accordions, has been damaged in a little more or less than one meter by a wire that has been trapped.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
Astronauts, who initially had to carry out a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who's been chosen to go cariculate at the end of 30 meters in length of the remote-directed arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) of the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skillful, has the highly developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician has been charged with "opting" the "hered" solar panel.
After inspecting the damage precisely, he checked the wire and installed types of "tabillas" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " that had remained close to the air exclusive and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool you used, a small hockey stick wrapped with insulator to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "capuced" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts benefited from a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the launch of the Discovery for the planned return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently under way in the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautical and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4 % to 21.96 euros in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays in the slow progression of the A400M engine, which provides for the opening flight of the aircraft.
The cost of clearing the delay in delivering the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is " between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion of which more than EUR 1 billion for Airbus " , announced the home of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the operating result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, add without any more cryptic accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, essentially because of loads linked to the delays of another programme, that of the very heavy carrier A380.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming its aspiration for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends the voters a televised message about public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting to deliver a new burden against the West accused of interference - his theme of choice during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
Denunciate a campaign wreaked by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says that there has never been such a dirty election until the Eltsin era.
After the repression of the demonstrations of the last weekend, the former world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days' imprisonment for unlawful demonstration, visits by his lawyer are prohibited.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two more open questions:
Who Will Happen to Putin at the Presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Selected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful united Russia party that the government and the president would choose?
Whatever the case, legislative elections as well as the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
" The Russians kept the minds of the Soviet homo, they don't feel the owners of their destiny," says Sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada independent center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin restored the model of a paternalist state, which was perfectly accepted by the population, since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic shock " , says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " give up their own personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved after the collapse of the USSR.
"What to reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, they will not vote either by extremists.
Concluding Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million file documents, stored on 27 km of shelves at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not available here only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e., individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or his/her legal guardians.
The eleven managing States - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been concluded, openness has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow search " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers ", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these files administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, had opposed the opening of these nominating documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
Records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the countrymen deported or subjected to compulsory work and, where appropriate, to give them proof of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees treat tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected of these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the AntiSemitism Research Centre at the University of Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade has already reached around EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union's Foreign Ministers had approved the European Commission in April to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in order to sign free trade with India, South Korea, and the Indo-European bilateral trade is now about EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to European Commission figures.
" A free trade pact will do a lot of good both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner specified. Asian and European giants change annually by " 47 billion euros of goods " and by " 10 billion euros of services ", he declared this week Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential". The European Union and India are on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about relieving the current return on credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion to the basic index of 5.75 % in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" To alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of their expected reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , indicated in a communiqué.
The bank states that EUR 10 billion (14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12h 15 GMT, the basic index and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the England BoE bank puts liquidity in the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that " it is prepared to take other measures to maintain the rates " of interbank loans per day online with its core index.
The interbank index per day was on Wednesday of 5,829 %.
The rate after three months was set at 6,6 %, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with an important rate of penalty that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the euro exchange rate, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the examination of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre group refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to a rejection of the text.
The text was included in a socialist "nice" (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a decade of action taken on Tuesday by the national PS office, including an increase of 50 per cent of the surplus for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (internal rate for petroleum products), a check-transport or rental restrictions.
Since UMP and NC had voted against the examination of articles (180 voices against 115), the meeting was held at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and a few hours' opposition to the television intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Melvin Benn British producer's Republican Festival.
"To our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no less, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
In another time known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989, he took the direction of Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as a " most inspiring event " that he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and we worked with Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic by this project.
Unfortunately, we're stuck in low-class policies because of the current administration, chasing Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare ourselves to create a magnificent festival at an exceptional site that, lately, takes place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after being unmarked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both developments recorded respective gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours are conducted more in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of a country festival in the European and urban way to the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The community of Vineland, including the mayor, eagerly supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but affirms "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer of this festival is "very great", like the 80 000 people from Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed when he went under the press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His colleagues from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal Faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the task of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the " runaway productions " .
Is it difficult to compete with the Governor?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," she says.
The Race to Festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of the cinema here.
The race to the Oskares is started.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them courage and make sure that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Age had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display at Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be year-end rally in stock? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to fire the closing exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made based solely on statistics, even more so because, in the current context, uncertainties are on the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange taking the street during the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest due to the lack of collateral alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values in both the long and short stages."
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a more lateral behavior, not free of volatility "especially because it is not known the impact of the probable decline in Fed types, given the high level of the raw and the danger of stimulation of inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, sales manager of BPI in Spain, coincides with that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the peaks marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Even so, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst from Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that take place every year on these dates.
However, the expert softens that things will be somewhat different this year because he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect market trends.
For its part, Federico Olucha, Analyst of Investsis Bank, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound of the index that could be promoted depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst trusts them to be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for bringing the Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it's up to the great values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electric sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the rise will come from the hands of the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers may also benefit from this rally if they are given.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow their own path," explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a low month.
The real year-end rally was lived in 2003, when the stock market came out of the crisis caused by the cracking of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a 6.68 per cent hit.
You will need to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment Ibex has risen by 8.36 per cent since January) and if you can count on your end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew much of their offices.
In total 200, they are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group to decide to jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to make the move.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the popular experience will be decisive for other entities to focus on this initiative that supports trade schedules.
This is precisely the goal popular pursues with the project.
To capture the private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, autonomous and trades of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernise the branches already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not involve a major investment, although if a higher staff recruitment is made, since it is only about six employees per site to eight or nine.
Offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be correct, according to Rivero.
There are currently 2,500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the Mundocredit brand, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax premises they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' notes Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with staff outside the bank.
Telefive doubles for the first time the value in Bolsa of its rival Antena 3
We did it.
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction yesterday, Mr. Paolo Vasile, the managing adviser of Telefive, at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain running duplicated the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Just one aspect of his joy was his: 'it's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown up but because we've gone down less', he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telefive finished yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That gain is your loss in what we've been doing for the year at 15.66%.
The value in Mediaset-controlled company stock exchange (with 52% of the capital) and attended by Vocent (another 13%) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulates a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in Prisa (Five-Day Editor) and 1,779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we cost it in terms of audience.'
Telefive announced last week that he planned to turn this year into the first television channel to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the managing branch of Telecinco and Publiespaña, who manages the advertising of the group.
If this data is made real, the television network would record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing over the 2006 financial year of 965.4 million.
For its part, the net billing of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the exercise (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría allocated 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is soon to make the decision, this ratio may vary after 33% of Endemol is purchased in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we are able to make our shareholders happy, those we have already valued with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows at this time of some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telefive in 2008 by 4% and by 7% in 2009.
The projected growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same firm has dropped Antena's expected earnings by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.
3 Opinions
1.
Ibersecuritys: It recommends buying both values based mainly on their high profitability by dividing and sustainable potential in the long term.
2.
Madrid box: sees Telecinco better (cumulate) than Antena 3 (maintener) for the 'multiple attractive' and business lifts.
3.
JPMorgan: It recommends to infrapond in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary process, which today ended with the vote by Congress on amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the rules of procedure which will develop the new law, with the aim that they both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and consent to the best regulation in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of entities for markets to function efficiently.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, implies the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) and promotes cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new legislation will provide financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial service firm (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the implementation of operations on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are complemented by multilateral trading systems and internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they perform, in order to facilitate CMMV's oversight.
In its passage through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments were incorporated, including that the debt titrated is considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with the debt of high-risk U.S. mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delineate the functions that graduates can develop in Economics and Business 30 years after the actual decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work for others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and may provide its services for the marketing of products and the collection of customers to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forwarding indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be made known on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the rise of the IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has hoped that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in Congress corridors that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy regarding the advanced data today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (16,800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, there were record deposits of more than £25,000, a figure that had gradually fallen in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its customers and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of that money that the Government offered and which would remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to achieve those remaining £18 billion until the target of £30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their preferred to rescue him from the bankruptcy.
Arrested the mayor of Totana for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested today at the first hour of the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) for its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the Consistorium ' s secretaries and the chief of police of the municipality has also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, now a popular deputy, and until then a director of the municipality, and that according to sources of the research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Agents continue to register municipal units and council of Urbanism and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER Cadena reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' MP Juan Morales, so far away, was stopped leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the research, according to sources of the research, is the alleged collection of commissions of Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to re-qualify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to lead PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced in press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and the Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief of the executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and "Bono is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes" is the case that the missing politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made his decision on 15 November not to take part in the next general elections and leave his career in active policy to focus on combating climate change in the university field.
The former Minister has recognized that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since leaving it two years ago.
He has also pointed out that, just as citizens know who the economic vice-president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress in a "transparency act".
If you reach the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry" and to make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak calmly and quietly is Congress, the president of the government at one time interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good deed" and he has not wanted to see already taking up his position so as not to fall into what he has pointed out, his adversaries might view as "prepotence".
Climate advertising
Since the movement against climate change is subjected to bitter persecution both the sceptics of their predictions and those that prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And another leader of the movement who is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges you to explain why your Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's leadership of the EU in Kioto's non-compliance.
Who are responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors has occurred and why his Government, the one in the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
It also requires the Spanish people to explain clearly what measures they will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits should be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences will it have.
I mean, who's going to sacrifice and who's gonna pay to save the planet.
But there has not been or will be such explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costs, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Even the gas cent suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, that it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With striking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for the electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor demands nor demands, but he adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
When it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not expect us to cycle or cool with the fan.
Arrested the mayor and chief of the local police in Totana by an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the city council secretary and a host businessman for possible urban crimes, have today informed sources of the investigation.
The building was arrested at home and has been transferred to the Consistorio, in whose units are currently located alongside many agents, who have also visited the Council of Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three arrests are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been brought before the courts today.
According to the sources, the former director of Totana and today the MP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, who owns a registered real estate agency today in Totana, has been charged, like the current former director's girlfriend, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the vigues lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as did Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Immonuar, an agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a company of highly known poultry products in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the lively parking lots of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way in the head of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day the criticism of Blackburn's book appeared, curiously:
"The content of the philosophy's signature has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Councillor for Education in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and said that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague reports on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet Discharge Crimes:
A. The discharge of a song would be a crime of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if disks are stolen in the store of less than EUR 400, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the charge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than that of the discharge (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in compact exchange.
Participating in a tumultuous queen has a sentence of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and exchange would be a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than reducing a film to DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, someone is leaving his hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor took me off one of his articles on rare research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less'.
In other words, the feelings that generate the monthly pay of workers depend on what fellow workers earn.
The study has been carried out using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group at the Life &Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if both were successful in receiving the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one received the double, activation was higher.
I don't know if it took so much science this conclusion.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the prosecution of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term of office ends at the end of the year and Carla is going with an agricultural taste, because the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic remain free.
His names are on that list of which his title is taken by the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not stressed in Spain) who, at the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the escaped criminals and press the governments involved to tighten the fence.
What sure is good for me?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible loss, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the carne, the marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of the vehicle, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialised in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed in return for its liability for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of injury.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the carne, the marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
The insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that they are more likely to suffer an accident, more likely to pay.
That is why both older women and 25 have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of sinisterness due to their prudence.
Similarly, by taking account of the accounts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with this the probability of having some kind of perchance.
Increasing frequency increases probability.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables in choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured person, provides a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are in a number of disadvantages in hiring affordable insurance, such as the low driving experience and the age of the sheep.
While the ideal to be well insured is a risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose a whole risk with freeness, so that they obtain insurance coverage at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the client pays a part of the amount of the sinister.
"The part of the amount of the loss the customer makes will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, the maximum responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so the customer will ensure protection against damage to third parties, even if not to those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid the sinister to the extent possible, since this will have an impact on the bonus, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that basic tariff.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year, it will be possible to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After the 25 year line drivers have easier to hire insurance, as the rate of sine-sterality is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended is to hire a whole risk with frankness.
"Youths normally cannot make use of the previously acquired experience when using an accident, and even when driving", says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'novice' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children, it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as their economic situation permits it, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with a lower rate of sinisterity, so the charges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (may be EUR 300), or, where a high level of bonus is available, one to third party extended from the third year of the vehicle’s life.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchise," said Luis Noguera.
For retirees, insurance at all risk is recommended with franchise (if it is EUR 150), or one is extended to third parties when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic seeks in Milan a point that is worth the eighths
Milan and Celtic are measured on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they need to achieve their respective objectives in closing the Liguilla de la Champions, as Italians serve to be first and the Scots to judge their classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, receives the Benfica, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two parties in Group D will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to contend the World Clubs in Japan, where it starts on day 13 in semifinals seeking a place for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would stay first and will ensure a better cross in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's set could even serve a defeat to be ranked if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but can't be trusted because on equal terms nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter the Scots at night, trusting to get in eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round the last campaign with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the go.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar to whom only the triumph is worth, in case the Celtic loses, both to get in eighths and to follow in UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, despite being the last and without options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with what UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since it was dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the Vancouver GM Place stadium that the group's meeting is "bright".
About 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that raged in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went to the stage with a couple of bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the public who was covering the GM Place, despite the fact that the nerves of Victoria had been banned days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "has not seen our wardrobe, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what you're going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," said Chisholm about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other a lot."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special flight from Virgin Airlines.
Upon his arrival at the airport, he was expecting an army of nannys.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California, San José, and Los Angeles on December 4th and December 7th.
In Madrid they will act on 23 December.
New fears of gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it affects the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute earlier last year reduced supplies to the EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, a monopolistic gas owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on how much money Ukraine was to pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge Ukraine more, as it is committed to paying 50 per cent extra in 2008 for the gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," said the Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh to the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly rose prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of EU supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "should prove foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the criminal record records of employees outside Europe, said one vigilante.
The recommendation of Auditor General Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the number of foreign personnel it counts with.
However, his report noted other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area, following attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after a jeep hit the doors of the airport's terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged car bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment cheques for candidates, to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the Agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The report of the Auditor General recommends, inter alia, that the Boards should rely on the Guide to Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS personnel."
BMA President Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what is the added value of the recommendations made," he explained.
Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number may be higher, partly because the boards have problems identifying what are the employees with indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely implemented.
This includes passport controls, work permits and qualifications check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide of foreigners in NHS.
The Health Secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, states: "It was of great interest that this work was carried out following the terrorist attack of Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which they had planned to publish next month.
Joy Division reigns in cinema awards
Control, the biographical film about the late singer of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for Curtis' role, director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
The actress Judi Dench was named better actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the variety prize for putting a British film on the international stage.
The prizes were given at a ceremony in the London Roundhouse.
Control continues the rise to Curtis' fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - with soundtrack from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds.
But also winner was Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic character of the album Joshua Tree of U2, awarded with two awards- to better director and best debuting director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning at the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the award for the best documentary.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a leader of the Russian Mafia in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promesas del Este.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris prize for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifty-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently filmes the sequel of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Glass Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that prize, so named in honor of Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor."
Independent cinema awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell activists planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the local monarchy, in partnership with the United States, since 2003 following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 to protect Abqaiq facilities, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed attack by Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Minister of Interior, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "Missile Launch Expert", who has entered the country.
The minister said that the militants had planned the smuggling of eight shells into the country.
22 other detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active to stop Saudis who travel to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda as militants to fight the Allied Forces and support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered a heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sudanese.
Al-Qaeda militants have in the eyes of many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - chosen by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-Western government of the country - had as objectives the residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This has been a great effort by the security forces, for five months' work," said the Interior Minister's spokesman on State television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 others accused of providing financial support and support to militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, they declared scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a gem on Earth than previously observed.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from Oxford University's Department of Physics and one of the leaders of Venus Express mission, states: "It's clarifying why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when it's two planets so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police seized "enriched uranium"
A kilogram of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesperson stated that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds sterling).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it is unworthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where common voters and currents record video questions and send them for their dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions put in the afternoon of Wednesday, 28 November, were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the republican YouTube party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party in the face of next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates for applicants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest on a single subject, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to go up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the broadcasters noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest exchange of words of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of recruiting illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when they were asked whether any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed to the issue.
No one has the word of being nominated as a candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance to illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other concerns abroad, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not believe literally in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first of all in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to respond if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increased in Iowa, coincidently with the fund-raising campaigns of liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements of the Wednesday debate.
The two have come from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early party and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it likewise emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
No influence seems to have been sold, nor are these exorbitant accounts of hotels in Paris, nor extramarital fingers sucked.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour Party of over £650,000 ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister failed to call an election, insulting British intelligence stupidly by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and trial poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative record.
A trio of retired generals launched a riot in the chamber of the Lores, protesting against the military spending cuts: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a middle-time job.
Now are David Abrahams' multiple donations; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is heading irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People do not believe them as politicians, but usually suspend their unbelief when a new lot takes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve things, which he does not have much time, that suspension is too much: public officials are beginning to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is getting defensive and not focused.
In one part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although I wanted to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions that Brown made as a Chancellor of the Era.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blairish's countertimes - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, no one has been cheated directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charitable gifts, says that he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision doesn't make it.
The laws against anonymity for large political taxpayers are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, would obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising, to whom he was asked about donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not so far involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these proceedings, although the bulk of the payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the job.
It has been quick to condemn your party for violating the law, but it is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a committee of inquiry on the matter - conducted to a large extent by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent leader for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, since he has not had one for six months and must also press for a genuine reform of the funding of the parties.
This will require hard cooperative work by the Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation that is held with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan such as Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and strong competition.
Card sharks
The crisis of subprime mortgages is infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that a few dorsal fins swim excited around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes placed on the country market of credit cards.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or have more than 30 days' delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken over 1.4 million in its financing business to the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of card lenders.
However, it is very early for panic.
Moroity and delinquency are on low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third trimester crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of people (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a huge loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of lust) would be growing again, or it could happen that the conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid rates of payment, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But the issuers of the credit card look more at the flow of liquidity than the active values, so that the falling prices do not necessarily make a change in the lending capacity of the lenders.
They can even work to help the broadcasters.
The incentives for consumers to continue to amortize the mortgage decreases if the properties are less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt goes up on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid retaliation of assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Head of Capital One Finance.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit contraction pushes America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more severe future.
We need to keep an eye on those back fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were in charge of their responsibility for fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were convicted this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for joining Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to be enriched at the expense of employees.
They were brought to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group in the Royal Bank, became known in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, your case marks the end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that it was the objective of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The charge against bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron society controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, who helped their spiral fall into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew that it would value in height.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its subsidiary parts.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the collapse of Enron.
Three months later the British trio was arrested.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year sentence and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failed business appear successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay, and the former executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling were charged with crimes last year for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of over 24 years.
Lay's sentence of conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, begins at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"Has capacity up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumer-related orgy held at a center of events near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract the new Russians wealthy to all kinds of products, from caoba crafted yachts to the diamond-encrowed car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at the nearby stand."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplied with fuel by the rise of oil, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when he was in high spirits.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"As the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, this week a conference will be held on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billionaires that make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think-tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, some 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow--and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, London's jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are impeccablely prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the Sunday evening party, dressed in evening costume, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeled off the design costume that used as a network paper veteran disbling with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cutplums, Mövenpick ice creams, tables for charged swimming pools, apartments in Dubai and Teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44,57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch porcelain Delft, in front of a mural reconstruction of a painting by Rembrandt, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said that Russians who are rich in more travel (10 to 15 years old, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the striking logos to the limited edition brands, which would not be exposed at a commercial fair.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director general of the King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cachemira and cotton mixed with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the brilliant orange Porsche, for $17,000,000 to a Russian millionaire.
In the afternoon of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said that he had sold three car grilles in the form of chain bracelet, for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with incrusted rays of Swarovski crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, will not necessarily drive over those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep the car in his garage, next to 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusiveness, given the wave of prices of real estate.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionaire already, at least on paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There's more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone cabins (British style) filled with stacks of $1 million fake bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking money batteries, asking their friends to take pictures of their mobiles while resting on lots of money, or borrowing a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev says.
Chapuza surgery could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance went up White Cape Cod, two doors below on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance come up," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Newark police department director.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works in the 212 Av. West Scott's house.
The authorities do not yet determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available for a few weeks. It will help resolve the mysterious death that has hung to the upper ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been a helper to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, working and tenaz," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcoholic Drink Control Commission, leaving two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepmother.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for the County Union Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs Arroyo died following an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they came home about 3 P.M.
On November 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead in the place.
It's been over a week and the authorities have said little about your research or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered to the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a marchito rosel is located in the front of the house, and a Dalmata bark in the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainylline ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - was located at the door of the coachman, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to the side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rude political culture.
"She would say, "you have to watch with this or that," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when not.
It's embarrassing."
Federal reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm down the credit conditions with cut interest rates, which increased with the reassuring comments of the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
The stock exchanges were loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, Ben Bernanke, President of the Reserve, declared that policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continuing tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure the markets in the midst of growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "partly reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October".
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, said Kohn.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
Observations also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the U.S. economy, such as sales of homes that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice of Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4 per cent of its total labour force, in an overall cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in the US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones rose to 331 points, or 2.55 per cent, to 13.289.40, while the large S&P 500 index rose to 2.65 per cent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose to 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, when it closed to 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to Britain's top-ranking companies.
The Dax index in Germany rose by 2.6%, and CAC40 in France was above 2.3%.
Previously, it was highlighted the resurgence of credit voltage in the markets after a strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks by 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained the credit and the three-month loan rates "Libor" between the British banks, meant the largest increase since September, 6.59%, after a steady increase since 12 November.
England judges the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as hard as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no one is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moore, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the office of Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill up offers to become a national selector, and if not, in part time.
The one who doesn't get the sixth place of batting will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket is the choice difficult, as trials are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubebby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to pick up the captain's eye at the same time to take a "wicket" and a beater to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have impact as a player one day.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison claims to "fit and bowls" like the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class jackpots in 33 races each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of them.
The Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every test and did well in the first five jackpots and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to settle at the same time who became a major player, and despite a double score against Australia, may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today's Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both of them.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first class in front of only 6 Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent precedents against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten races on his two shifts in May against West Indias on the test in Lords, his house as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken from his "batting" something of propeller than in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex’s team has the joy of living on swords.
He's stuck for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he flew his vehicle into an exhibition for England's car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to say excitedly, "Did you see that?".
Bopara is the best player, he is including his swing pass to have effects on his games that seem to satisfy him, as it beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as suggested by the tea leaves, he is the one who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria started to arrive in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left with no cash, no visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I've read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and it's safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he states, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary cease.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis to work in his country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him by phone to tell him that an Allied U.S. force helped to get Al-Qaeda out of his building to the west of the capital, and they urged him to come back.
One of the new arrivals of Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been led from home to Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after urging the citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my companions."
"That's why I came back today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by the increasing calm in the capital since U.S. troops were building groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighbours.
But many have declared that they have returned because of the refusal of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have been established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled the country because of the sectarian gangs of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and begin the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only an educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for fiftyth time to a non-Serlander who we are not French" - that was the ironic motorcycle about themselves from the smallest federal state for his fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the education system of the Sarre which, in a study by the Instituto de la Economía Germana (IW) called Bildungsmonitor, took the fifth place.
In this way, higher schools by tradition have good relationships with neighbouring countries.
The university of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can finish their university career with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than average in higher schools, many of them do not have a baccillery.
"In the Sarre, the system of vocational education is being used," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the Instituto de la Economía Germana (IW).
More than five young people make their bachelor’s degree at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 points per cent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for vocational and academic education is very broad.
The offer of dual careers, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and an increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of the Sarre forced higher schools to make more publicity for engineering specialties.
"After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", this project has no cost at all. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of late students in school development decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But in general, the Sarre did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
For the sake of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they can achieve good results.
Although the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject at the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chávez changes the time.
Nearly in Venezuela there will be another different time zone to the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez left to change the schedule in South American country by delaying the half-hour clock.
Currently Chávez is staying as a comic in Spain.
As the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State reported, according to the new law, the time will be at least four GMT hours.
Thus, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision to say that the United States imposed its obligation on the world in its day by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighbouring country Colombia due to the action with hostage-taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not have any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until Conservative Álvaro Uribe continued to be President of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country have to decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe by withdrawing Chávez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticising that the decision taken by Uribe has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chávez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuing interruptions by leftist populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong situation.
The experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees are expected to have a lower real salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The blame for that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the spread of food and energy prices," said the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomic Institute and Research of Economic Cycles.
The new unemployment insurance charges may also be for employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention of reducing the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent over one year, is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and grants to the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social-Democrat Party.
On Tuesday, the rate of inflation with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector was reported to have reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3 %.
Venus: Twin brother from Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most like the Earth, something that had not been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and somolins in the poles, the same that appear also in winter on the Earth.
For three decades, researchers have suspected that there could be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays are silent at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles told the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, had given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it's not like this: if I ever lived there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on Venus' surface there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface there are temperatures of 500°C, swinging so that temperatures under zero can be reached.
"Perhaps Venus is a "diabolic" twin on Earth, but it's still a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus Express" is to answer the question why Venus, so much like the Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step in the investigation of Venus.
The latest results of the research to be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to researchers, not only emphasize Venus' uniqueness in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with the Earth than we had assumed," says ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon recalls wind flows in the high atmospheric layers of the poles, according to a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost so large.
This planet also called a blue star or evening star orbits around the Sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bar is not much like the Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed in the same conditions.
On the two planets water had been aggregated that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it disused itself in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, in Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the match between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Foreign Office.
He indirectly criticized the German Social-Democrat Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end this fight by receiving Dalai Lama.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler said to the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding with regard to the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely in force for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, the Federal President stresses, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of Una China's policy.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Foreign Office caused great misunderstanding in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to sources of information from the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of Chinese government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Ángela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama demonstrated that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances like those in France.
Battles with the police on the streets, shots, car burn: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like the case of France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from moving to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious disturbances caused by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We need to look at TAMBIÉN that our country's social problems do not take the violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," said the newspaper "Neue Presse," published in Hannover.
Not all young people are developing in the constant change in social reality.
The Federal State, the federal state and the municipalities are already working with emphasis on solving these problems, said Schaeuble.
That refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits."
It's still early to sit down the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as is the case in France.
The young people played a major role in the streets with the police in the north of Paris last night.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above the average.
There should be more vocational training posts.
Kolat emphasizes: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", more than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
"The opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training more quickly needs to be given."
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with lights overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of almost 1,000 police officers has been on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
On Monday night around 80 police were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the next night in Toulouse.
The riot started with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of young people was not the result of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The action far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that nothing more has to be expected.
But what country does the Chancellor live in?
After her desperate action, indifferent and contentless in the general debate of the Lower House, she must say: she does not live in the country that should be governed by it.
As to the reproach he was given for having repeatedly devoted himself to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptive sentence.
He said that would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he did not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House it was very clear to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
There was no sense of interest, no feeling of any kind of feeling about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it was very self-declared by the decisions made in Heiligendammm, but it says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, he's engaged in expressions so he can get a boost on people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the inner problems are low-value appearances.
The poverty of children and the concerns of low-paid workers?
All she does is talk about this subject using subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong to speak when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a heated debate of Republican precadents from YouTube and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between candidates are already noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney criticized his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
He, for his part, responded with grave reproach: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for illegals." Giuliani answered the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans has no clear favourite, the eight presidential precadents take advantage of the debate at the CNN, especially in order to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users that were sent to Youtube, do not have much content either.
"With this method of isolation we let Hitler come to power," that was John McCain's reproach on his opponent Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing Iraq's troops.
Romney also receives many criticisms from veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the Waterboarding, a method of interrogation, by allowing one to drown a person simulate his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important topics of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised the conservative values and denied the rise of taxes.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney, composed and apologizes to the people and the television audience for defending abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what she thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president took an oath as president.
This ends the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second term of five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as chief of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he was made with power with an incrutable military coup, the former general ruled for the first time the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the Musharraf oath, will soon cancel the state of emergency and will meet the second condition of the west.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many lawyers in support of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all remedies before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a convoy of the military in the Northern Water Region, five soldiers died and four others were injured.
According to information from the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are coming back.
The most famous German band in the 1970s follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a restreno was made a copy of "Live 1974" which was written at the best time in the band.
Already in those times they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the feeling.
Each one of them has before him his box, his cables and above all his buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock fans was the fact that the Harmonia band was back in music.
What is to rebel here is the following: the questions have shown that the name of the band rumbled in people's minds, but it was not as special as that after 32 years the public missed her so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the Krautrock mistake was always more valued in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to the members of Cologne Can 2003 band for their life work, they could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouth with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio existed only two years and in those times it did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Dusseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Roth had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruins of the 16th century, lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
As they say, one day an association banner of song Harmony of Ottenstein appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmony" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do it from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on themes of esotericism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and has since had more success than Harmony had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that must be thanking Groenemeyer.
His Grenland music company became a goal to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Snow! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a superband, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's sentence accompanied by the special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmony with producers appears on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where instruments with cables are seen.
At the bottom there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and the battery in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Today electronic music is just like it had to be.
Three people who deepen the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical setting it is coughed, sweated and in a good moment of emphasis it is sung "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never rock.
It was not looking for the origin of gender in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here shouts "68!" he's right, too, but now Harmony keeps calm.
On the stage, we think very well about what is already obvious.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
That can break one's nerves or give a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to war in the Balkans.
But they were not very convinced.
Or the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the mountain of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the inner darkness of the country during the war in Bosnia, was discovered again actor Richard Gere.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and little importance roles in movies for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why nowadays the movie titles have to be so long and shot?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the sight: deep down, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destiny and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life had already passed, that as a monument of the ruin of his decadence had so far preserved most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", in spite of this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, it turns out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be described in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from Kosovo snipers, one of whom acts very quickly and that also leads to her falling in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented again as the only guilty ones.
The film is like the German series "Alarm be Cobra 11" without highways, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good movie about war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another script author (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about the American reporters in the war who went to detect a war criminal Serb called "zoro", it could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go to the mountain twice to carry out something that the army cannot do and every time it turns out to be a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at the beginning they introduce us to Simon Hunt, who they don't let simply be a cynic with hearts.
No, the script also foresees a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will then kill.
So "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive speed accomplish what they could not achieve for five years the NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters, who went to capture the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to get revenge in a fair manner.
It is so bad that they want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, one deeply human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and points out that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his face I see, sharing feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem consists not only of the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star goes through a region of crisis or the mining fields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "bloody diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to go through at least decades until Hollywood steals a good film about the holocaust, as an example of the film "The Schindler List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not celebrated unanimously as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because script authors don't have the least repair (which is necessary for power) in telling good stories.
"Being or not" or "The great dictator" turned out to be so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps it must be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic, distant look from an artist.
When asked him about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's just because some things never change."
Large cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympics as a response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms from politics and the economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that it must be realistic to estimate possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, stated Wednesday this resignation as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the great city promoted as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal one could not maintain political, sporting momentum at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Summer Olympics did not take place until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but decides on it by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
It referred to the decision of the Sportbund, which is expected in early December, on Munich's request for the Winter Olympic Games of 2028.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, we so far thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no opportunity."
Despite all this, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets the statements by von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity go, if at this time the plans are ruined," said Günter Ploß, HSB's director on Wednesday.
A waiver of the request is contradictory to the statement by the head of the Senate that he made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Sport Federation of the Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's request for universities in 2015 not as "a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the sports Federation of higher schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Fraction of the German Social-Democrat Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) challenged the Senate that it did not take such valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required an integrated Olympia planning for the small Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the 2012 Summer Olympics gave rise to great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Those who relate the terms Sweden and wooden box, think about Ikea, but don't think about Andy Warhol.
Oh, yeah?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-Box "type" on this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" had questioned the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Modern Museum Museum of Stockholm carried out internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the Modern Museum, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of "Stockelmo type", which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the boxes of red, blue and white wood, with the same sample that they had "Brillo" soap powder.
According to Warhol, at the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Museum Moderna Museet there were exposed hundreds of Brillo-boxes of cardboard. These did not make them Warhol (due to expenses), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a glass-box of wood, but they were not exposed at the Museum Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now talk about that almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stocolmo type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died three years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Museum Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First printed and shimmered their silvers pressed and then painted them to oil with brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed silvers. Furthermore, it is not oil painting, but acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo-Boxes," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museum Museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exposure objects."
Already in Julio The Authentification Commission formally announced accepting these "severe accusations" in which it refers to boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment on, everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender to Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers had surrendered to a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Head Antonio Trillanes, who criticizes the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
The soldiers loyal to the government had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been hanging in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had the trial on Thursday for trying a coup d'état in 2003 that ended in a failure.
It took advantage of the negotiations, so that it could suddenly be deposited with about 30 supporters.
The military police who were to keep watch of him evidently had gone to their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent session of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Counsellor, condemned the conduct of the soldiers.
"People are tired," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to move on to our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite squad Scouts, said soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The great critics of government called on Thursday for a great demonstration against the president.
For months your government has been reproaching for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention to the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts at democratically elected government coups in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel's biggest shareholder.
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of Versatel’s telecommunications company’s actions.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for an action is 14, 46 euros.
It's only 20.05 percent of the capital.
There were many speculations about the absorption of the company.
There are also options for increasing the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to speed up the consolidation of the German DSL market (Digital subscription line).
On Wednesday, they already made assumptions about entry into the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its participation to the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution maintains the participation securities for a third party.
United Internet already on the previous day made nearly 10 percent of the Dillisch telecommunications company participate.
Drillisch has placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth € 106.4 million in the capital expansion measure.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares from them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies started negotiations on DSL-products marketing cooperation.
"We strengthen our collaboration," explained the spokesman for United Internet.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire the Freenet competitor.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be content with 10 percent participation in Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, make participation to 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially participation in the anonymous Freenet society.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third Freenet quarter there were 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the United Internet and Drillisch holding had 6.01 percent of the participation in Freenet.
So they agreed that Drilllisch is going to get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
