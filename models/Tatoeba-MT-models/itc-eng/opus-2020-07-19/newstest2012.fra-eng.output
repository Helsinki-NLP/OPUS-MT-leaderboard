Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
As part of an amendment to criminal law, the Ukrainian parliament rejected the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
The MPs refused in second reading the proposed amendment to reduce the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having reached a disadvantageous prior agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court is due on the conviction's appeal in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the political revenge judgement of the regime and has provoked a process of suspicions of bias of the court to the west as well.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winner remains to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderate or radical.
The Interim National Council has established the usual law of the Sharia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a country free of crime because for a flight we cut hands.
Women can forget emancipation, the possible non-respecters of faith are subject to capital punishment...
It is the Qur'an that will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society made up of opposite tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot represent it and as we certainly would not love it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and it would probably not be advantageous for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted help with recognition from unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who directed the strikes of NATO but rather Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam and our pellets turned away from the dictator as a political ally without bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly employ Libya.
So there's no problem for the premises to get rid of the "croarse".
Will oil companies have easy access to Libyan black gold without land occupation?
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of the protection of the human rights interests.
Little by little that we prevent these Charia followers from doing so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eye of investors.
A statistical tornado passed on Tuesday over Europe.
Each state has published GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
The two countries modified the data for the second quarter during which Germany placed itself better than expected (a rise of 0.3% instead of 0.1% expected), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was a question of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, it is confirmed that there is a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, depending on the data planned and recalculated periodically.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is what analysts had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The ten-year performance is 28.45%
The yields of the obligations of Spain and Italy are rising to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields of Czech bonds remain below 4% while the situation in the region worsens.
A vote was taken in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate qualification for 200 million
The performance of the football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to Super Cech and Guard Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also very fortunately defended its qualification in the second part and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second part.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Czech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
Montenegrains were under pressure up to the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The vicitmes of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to Super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent from the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams had difficulty mounting combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not come to penetrate the Czech defence which answered precisely the long shots even during the first half of the time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a human shield.
Hundreds of students from higher schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support in this manner the nuclear programme of their country in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
Hundreds of students from the universities of Ispahan have created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They have thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran had not ceased to strengthen its nuclear armament.
A possible attack on Iranian nuclear institutions is reported in Israel.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
Food of an obese child: do not eat breakfast and take the carcuerie for dinner
Over one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren are overweight and 5% are obese.
As the current research shows, obese children come from families who have a unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models around it is.
On the tables of obese children, for example, there is 50% more charcuerie than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with awareness-raising action "obedity is not an accident"
In smaller families sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most of today's schoolchildren - only 15% replied that at least once a week the parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and attended 900 primary schools in Czechia.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not an accident", a fact supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, there have been more than 12000 sixth to third students enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children in overweight, or obese, is the absence, proper diet, and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch-eating- dinner, which is a basic principle of good food," says one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and dinner carcuerie
Experts draw attention to the fact that in order to have a healthy development, you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czechia, only 23% of students' families eat at the same time.
In most families each takes his breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been found is that one tenth of the population doesn't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis of good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that obese children's families are more often consumed with unhealthy fries.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks drink every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children in question do sports regularly but for parents it is only half, only 15%.
Prepare Your Food
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls in 13 schools) to prepare their own food on the basis of opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"Czech children's preferences between 12 and 15 years of age are far from the ideal for healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of cakes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is particularly a great preference for sweet lemonades", is indicated in the results of the investigation.
For lunch are the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want to be fertile and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Head of Health
The investigation also showed that children are prepared to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obedity is not an accident", a strong commitment was made to moving towards a healthy diet," the results of the investigation were indicated.
For example, the most significant was for sweet lemonades, as children have begun to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked the white meat and fish as a main dish and would reduce the sweet dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread and potatoes flour).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry with the fact that there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three specialty professionals, character dress and a seminar on what's going on.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we approach final exams and the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "sweet".
This time we have with Director Alenka (at the course there are no boys) treated how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, no particular curve, another of the overweight.
The stylist needs to know how to optically minimize broad arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to highlight the character very nicely and also not to dress too prominently of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and tight hips and a fine size.
If there is, for example, a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or trousers do not pass at all, that is worth doing it in measure.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccablely is invaluable.
In a fit fit you will feel a lot better than in the one that slips constantly, rolls and does not hold to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance, they may allow a Tucker style dress, with pieces of fabric, or embroidery.
Of course there are many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that because of what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode and its appearance.
I should "dress" Miranda Kerr, which you may know from the campaign the Victoria Secret.
At the bottom of my heart, I am happy because it is better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost 100 kilos lately (don't take my statement, svp, completely serious) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of the pen is also important.
The stylist not only wears physics but creates, for example, the productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphicist, has kept us from all this.
But this... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three speciality guests gave a diversified look to the Saturday session, filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka mode graphicist and Ben Renc, mode photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one dress differently.
Variability is a key example of this.
As for example, this trench-coat that has to be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but it can also dress up the naked body, with scarves and take it in a photo like a dress.
Or just go up the sleeves or collar and have a new look immediately.
"Play with that," he pointed out.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start to contradict it," Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variety of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (including a dozen models) I have to be ready to "retire" at least a fortnight.
And also, a dress and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count on this in the course of creating a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In Czechia, the approach to the use of stylists' services remains frivolous.
And the known faces sometimes consider them useless (it's enough that I know something but what I look like goes to the second level).
And if someone gets to do a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he tells us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we just sail on the google and make sure that the boulevard info reveals the celebrity in question, whether it is thin or thick, etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday about the heart that it's not enough for the stylist to get in the fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with people he dresss and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
You know how to guess people, don't flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out his wardrobe and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything and tell him, My God, what a horror."
"You'll find some things that you'll find pretty and that you'll advise them with what to wear," Mario said.
This has shown us concretely what must all contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It's the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to the clearly defined things such as scissors, hair rollers, or even feeding pins, there is also nylon wire (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which we close a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of aggrats are not usable because they could cut off the clothing) or a sewing kit.
So that we were not just people who listen but who tried something practical, they taught us how to resemble shoes properly.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could narrow down, to fortori outside.
And so we got caught and stuck.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to get hurt by accident.
So there is a real need for skills.
Mario enjoyed it when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm reporting isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a brief summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course
I increasingly begin to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what he wants.
The need for speed The Run fights across America.
By Way of Review
Originally a smooth race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
This fills up to a certain extent the ambition of each of us, but it does not serve anything if no one wants to do anything more.
The new sub-titled part The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new lead with the already old Need for Speed race series and exit a kind of game from playable parts that would not only count on points.
So we were curious how the passages added in which the main hero came out of his car and did what he wanted.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is entirely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole throws down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but instead the expression of incomprehensible fenetosis on the part of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are taken in the adventure of the main hero, Jack, who has character problems, and to resolve them, he is taking part in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The itinerary is divided into ten steps and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the planned steps in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player doesn't have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are overcrowded pretty good even though the graphic technical level is of the same type as previous series.
Finally, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The trials are also time-accredited with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall upon you.
Besides this, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There's only a small number, but that's enough.
There are moments you try to overcome the number of opponents (like in a classic race) and then run against the watch (the classic due to the timer) and then again wait another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and tries to make the situation difficult for you.
What's new is the off-vehicle crossings.
Rather, it's an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs in front of someone and you have to help him by taping on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer times than what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is well that this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that please the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but that it cannot be said to be negative.
With regard to realistic simulation, you'll have to go to the other side.
But although we can find a better match in the driving model is very good with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a certain period of time.
With the difference of the driving model, collisions are not yet in place.
We do not expect this game to be a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not, during a collision with any object, the least idea of how your car behaves, it is not entirely good.
During tight overruns you touch each other sometimes slightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy volts.
Or they're in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really upsets you.
Rebooting is done so that when you have broken the figure or have gone out into the setting the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen as it should, that something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and the solution must be found by remembering the piece of itinerary in question.
The big thing about this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that have to be passed in a certain way or that does not happen.
Otherwise you meet on a given location of "civils" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute in delay.
What angers these are the situations when you see easily passing the opponent between two cars coming in reverse direction and when you arrive, you either have to stand aside and bypass them or stop them.
It's equal if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens right near your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
All the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This pisses the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long reverse bridge.
The opponent must come before you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in reverse direction and you collide a lot of times.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you are getting bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You have to pay attention to petrol pumps on itineraries because you can change it by car however most of the time you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large U.S. cylinders for right highways and super sports cars with exotic turns on very technical routes, for example on lacy roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places you know about adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest driver level, different objects begin to unlock:
This connects online with the Autolog feature that compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the metro tunnel (this looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (that looks like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a metro line that sends you the car directly to the sawmill.
To the writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone actually thought about the creation of this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super.
What's troubling is that in more extreme situations, imaging doesn't hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This mainly concerns accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer useful for you.
The sound part is good and the track is on the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the most young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
Fun is really good, but prepare yourself to get the faults to fall into your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs act as negativists and Euroseptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically abolished the balance between institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation is calm and all players are accustomed to their new role," and Miléna Vicenova began her presentation to the Faculty of Law of the Czech Embassy near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different bodies of the EU and their relations in such a understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of speakers at Charles University's Faculty of Law could send it, she showed how much she takes her motto "understanding and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Ms Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the critics were echoing that it is fade, that it is a round-skin, that it cannot fill any mission and I must say that it has cut the breath to everyone because it holds its role to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of an answer to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What telephone number do I have to call?", so as an important step towards the unity and greater legibility of the Union's policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid our syrecky (sweet-cooked cheese that feels very strong)
Ms Vicenova also reported on the agenda she has lived, lived and will live at a time close to the European Council.
It qualified the Czech Presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It called the fall of the government of very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of Mrs. Ambassador, "the activity has fought its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself now.
Moreover, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which has become very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and for savings, which sector will have priority, which countries will help most, at least, all is to resolve in future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador reminded her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornichons, bananas differ widely, or that no one has forbidden us to do syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe at several speeds awaits us
According to the Ambassador of Czechs, they have the reputation of being Euroseptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The failure, she said, resulted from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish comes to me, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group of Visegrad still doing?"and he is not happy."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, these are tough new budgetary policy rules that await the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at several speeds, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the enhanced cooperation institute."
First of all, it was said that the countries that want to cooperate with them and those who do not wish to do so remain in their surroundings."
"There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a really two-speed Europe," Mrs. Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis for all themes having an impact on the EU to be discussed among all EU members and not only the members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
Innovator IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone was to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as close as possible, the closest would be "the long term".
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved for little time that people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the print around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the company's culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because it remained faithful to its core values and yet it was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more "declared for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to deal with his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the first U.S. employees to have paid vacations, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee's uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commercials.
Similarly IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
Society was at the beginning brilliant in the discovery of talent - as one of the first companies to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman-Vingina Rometty - who should replace Palmisano with the head of IBM.
The company has been working at IBM for thirty years and is currently in the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing what is called jamy, brain-storming online from what are a lot of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that provides a safe position in business.
"From the beginning IBM had a rather institutional concept than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard Economics School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems by using its technology," added Geogre Colony from Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiarly known in the United States with regard to its slogan - in one hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest firms in the world.
Of course, it is the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, consulting services at server products to nanotechnology.
It has numerous patents from all American technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
His findings include the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM was found this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it passed in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview in progress
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the client and of the time - IBM for example has not succeeded in betting on a OS/2-specific operating system, the Online Prodige service or IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the forward movement you can't emotionally stay stuck on the past," noted Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike for example the Microsoft concrent that stands at the base and remains under the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for one fifth by software and hardware, have a dominant place.
However, in 1990, it was with more than the strongest participation motive of hardware.
As of the year 2000, IBM sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, over the past period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of perspective technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its investment volume.
Did it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The IBM share price increased by 120 percent from 2008 onwards, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
This can be expected to mean that this flexible giant has control over other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheese to flights into the cosmos.
The IBM (International Business Machines) company was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 presided over the Society's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then made shadow to the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that so far rest the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the Kusqu's firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - from cheese and meat cutters to registered caisses.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the turnover multiplied to up to $9 million and the expansion of the firm began in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership his son was in charge of the chair of director Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded IBM in the last three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to intelligently evaluate technology in areas that have not yet been exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as IBM trade is concerned, it has recently developed a "Smart Commerce" platform that helps commercials manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history on our territory as well.
She created her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first Central and Eastern European country.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central and Eastern European Central Centre is based in Prague and there is also the research and development team at the global level that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and lay down clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova took refuge in the summer in Bartosova in her home, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not dismiss the singer.
And he confesses in public that he loved him.
Over time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's connection and ended up saying good-bye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing with whom her husband sleeps.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separates there will be no wife to welcome her at the door of the house.
"He is my son's biological father and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my old ass loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship", he let Rychtarova filter by showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we discuss completely normal but we don't sleep together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in knowing where she's going, who and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take full responsibility for myself," Joseph concluded.
Women's worst vices: Is this also about you?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, like each other, are able to "get them out of their sleeve".
My dear ladies, you will find out in the following lines of the women's vices who come to pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchases
Are you half making remarks that you're dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy in packages at the time of the balances?
In your case, you can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women believe that they should restrict their passion to make purchases.
But you'll say, which would resist the winery of the clothing stores, to look for yourself in beautiful clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
Although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he's waiting at the entrance...
Insatisfaction constant
"I'm not too big"?
"Would I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these phrases remind you of anything?
Yes?
You are therefore among those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop caring for yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partners are always complaining about their appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and women become poisoners.
Odre and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite manage.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, make the dust, dig the bathroom - and that twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they broke out the sink, smashed the window of the living room, and that gives you a lot of work?
If you are suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that there is no need to exaggerate and that order and cleanliness should not be at first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The Work of the Helmet
"Put this used overcoat into the trash."
"Do you have to put on these old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do with land."
If you do this work on your partner this way several times a day, you're really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much cow work...
Defamation, Persiflation
Defamation, perstilation, but also insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relations and thus are happy to deal with subjects such as who, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets escape a little harmless persilination here and there.
However, the hand on the heart is a woman's particularity.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflate, even look down on others and are for their surroundings - especially at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped through their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
Hokeyist Jagr twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL Monday game on Caroline's ice and is again leading the Czech players productive for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who still made an extra pass and was named the best player in the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also recorded two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told overseas journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the match he'd give his hattrick."
"I heard him."
"Sometime this feeling falls on you" explained Jagr after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shoot of the Flyers.
A moment later, there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the pallet and presented it to the Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer went down, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Incrementally to Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play in the end of my career with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL the other players on the team tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a penalty shot she ended with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read didn't separate from other complications that ended up two against one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) left to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia came with this victory in the lead of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montréal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out second third due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not face an experienced defender their advance of two goals lost after a 2:3 penalty shot.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
That's the fact that the back line was sick that mostly kissed the local coach rather than lost fists because they only played the match with 5 defenders.
"It's null."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement has not been enough and we have not been able to resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits, "he added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavleec, Czech defender took part in the thirtieth Winnipeg attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the Jets goals, which arrested a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time were offering trips mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, because trips to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled to East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a slant for the west and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, in Poland or in the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter or the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however, it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't yet won.
The agreement for currencies that was the condition to travel to the west was denied to people "politically incorrect" who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasted until now.
The Czech travels have since experienced a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at most, Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world.
The great paradox we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The removal of visas in the last 90s in the neighbouring countries of the West has caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, in Paris travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our incomes did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a trip of Czechs was at this time to take with themselves its own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the exchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after decades of freely buying Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage increased what caused another important time around 1997.
A growing demand for travel has begun since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter links, which thanks to contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
In the late 1990s the Czechs had visa-free connections with almost most developed countries around the world except the EU which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to faraway hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100000 Czechs who visit exotic countries each year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU deleted visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to settle completely in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for vacation abroad including attachments. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this could end with a situation without a solution "a bed"
Nearly 5 months already Czech football is without President and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek to the head of the Czech Republic Football Association will not yet be known after yet a General Assembly to take place in Nymburk on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement under which voting rules must be made.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and in the course of his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the year after Hasek the football returned backwards to differences between the chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This proved to be the case on September 16 when a new president had to be selected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a question of dealing with the way to elect.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, like, statutory representatives or also full-fledged officials.
In this only point, there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the assistance of the Office for the Status and the Law, that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences in the rules for the election continue.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also failed to do anything about the situation
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The apple of discord lies in the following: whether to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the proposed model, on the third round, the candidates who have received the highest percentage vote in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to retire to win the candidate who will have received the largest percentage of votes from the two chambers.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the votes.
"It would only then lose the idea of two previous laps and this would completely deny the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, which includes the objections of the moravian party and says that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even if he considers that the settlement of elections based on the most advantageous status Pelta among all candidates.
"I wish to vote at most in accordance with the statutes of the association."
"For there is not yet any sagrene ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner who was a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations was mainly defined against Pelta.
There's still optimism.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and he believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone".
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation" adds Jablnek's officer who, among the three, has the greatest experience in managing football both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are trends in wanting to change the regulations to design."
"It may again cause a blockage in the General Assembly."
"I still hope the sound reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement on all sides.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but which can tell if the entire management of the football will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and was looking for a variant to take part of the executive committee on the field of reprisals.
At the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parts of the country's strongest sport association and to bring them into agreement.
In the game there are many: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union to determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the battle for the President's position because he does not see any suitable candidates.
If the footballer leader of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile had responded to everything he requested for a new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association (AFRT) he would not be put in the countryside for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists I support it, I struggle for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik to the Czech Press Agency (CCTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of AFRT that would be favoured for this election.
Paclik also points out that if he won the elections he would hold this position as President only until 2013 planned for a General Assembly.
He would well see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but who is not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he says.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said to be particularly awkward is the relationship between Pelta and the President of Plzen Roman Berbr Regional Football Union, a man of the renowned contraversity who is known in the backstages as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to occupy this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-flight merchant, it would be even less favorable to football," proclaimed Paclik.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of hearing in an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta went without a penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA"dit Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
If Paclik triumphed on Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
"It has great capacity."
"He would be able, for example, to present himself as the leader of the representation."
"But as an association manager he wouldn't be able to."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew a great deal of attention when he decided to cancel the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macella, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He took as an example his ability to run private companies and he has also managed since last year the club in Plzen who celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and bring it a certain culture."
"I would slow down the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not look for his antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power with high-level policies would allow the sport to obtain more money from gambling tax.
"This is one of the key points the new President should take care of."
"If it's the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current link with Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the president of AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again connected with Jablnek and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"That's not the ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my actions from Plzen club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half after," said Paclik.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to bed situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Miroslav Pelta Presidency promised that if elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end to the dispute about the election settlement in the future.
Jablnek's official is prior to Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believes that today's success in football representation should calm this victory before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election which did not take place, has promised to devote itself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could enable him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and are waiting for a President to be here on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the lead of the Association," he adds, but it is primarily related to the Jablneg club, worked a lot of years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That's also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of the Statutes were approved which were not perfect as all of them saw."
"If there were not all these various interpretations, we would have had a President since September," said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took all the attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take on all responsibilities if it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," added Pelta.
He then strives, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He had previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized with regard to his legal training and that he fully knew that his first Vice-President would be his rival.
Nor has he long attacked Tonas Paclik who on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and he's already had some success."
His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and many people were surprised during the campaign.
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said at the address of his opponent, but he remains, he said, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from low-level competitions to national representation.
It's supposed to be a football vitrine.
"And I would also strive to finish all the cases that begin with the Bohemian or the aftermath of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for the entire football," she told the Czech Press Agency CTK on the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment at the head of football would not lead to any change in people.
"I should get to know all employees," he told Strahov, where there is a sense of nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of disagreement on how to vote on the third round we will get over it."
"Football needs credibility and will only get it when there's a new leader at its head," as Pelta puts it in an optimistic manner two days before the most likely decisive day for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT will start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday, that would not please many people, he said.
However, Rajchl promises that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring to football more money and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying that I'm going to do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members will deal with a specific area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions for football to face a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He stated, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and put doubts on each of my actions," he explained why he hesitated.
"A lot of people have told me that I must not give up because they would also give up."
"This trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, we say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the past two years, there has been a lot of work in fact and I don't want to let it go."
"There are processes that have been initiated that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them.", he said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union does not return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him are people who would do football in such a way that it would be only for those who were chosen."
"One can blame me for a certain number of things but certainly not to bear any."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it not only those who have been chosen
And he again confirms that he would only be a President for Czechia.
"And if there are people who say otherwise, I am ready to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts a Czech and the other moravian whose winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation like currently with only three moravian teams in the division because the current problem is to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech Chamber who elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be success," said Rajchl, who is considering among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations with television contracts and the gambling law.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has what to offer to football.
"No one can question Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he was elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a notable change among people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his success," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Sparrows in omni optics, beautiful pools in Budapest: Who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can leave his legs tired in gas baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Extended on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged cupolas, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not lack to admire the Art New meticulously restored from these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool was pleasant to her, she noticed in her book without delay all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were investigated in this way by the historian of Meder architecture and presented them in his book "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain".The covered municipal swimming pools of Münich, the historical baths palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
It has conducted its "travels to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it has visited Italy, France, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real fervor of the culture of the bath.
Meder, explains that she has not much interest in sport but he feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is irritating that swimmers must simply contemplate blue tiles and accommodate the javel water bridge while the players breathe from the scent enveloping epicéea forests or can listen to the gazelle of the park's joyful birds.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools should in fact always be if ugly" said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water double strengthens the architecture
A dive into a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - well-being factor in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders were given a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optically double: high vaults, multicolored tiles, tremples.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives the desire to make a jump in the blue.
The Meder collector discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Alongside the splendid well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (the cave bathroom in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath with basins filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zürich bath you have the whole city in your eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can watch the animation on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an OVNI that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal to the sky rise.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of Javel's water does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate from a odor of sulphur, from the Harpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekscsaba is a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to find in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During his search for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also experienced disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool and outdoor from Czechoslovakia, she was in front of a barricaded land.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
By taking a look at the New building-Art window in yellow-red-white, she observed the development of weeds among the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: The spa palace of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; we can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its design in 1844 but also a mausoleum hall in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it originated from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a good performance than to melt construction styles if different in such a formidable unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon speculation on raw materials?
According to SPIEGEEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group leader then wants to get the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions break down this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation into the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann points out that the speculation of the Scholarships on global raw materials, rises prices upwards and that the banks share a complicity with the global famine.
The consumer protection campaign specifically aligns itself with the head of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, the majority of experts share the view that betters have seconded out offers and demand - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently from US competitors: He promised to investigate the blame and said, "No case is worth putting into play the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the charges of Foodwatch-Report.
The review is to be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the Chief of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be taken.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode praised the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how banks today are damaging the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be especially under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments in its portfolio, for which money was invested on food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether the Deutsche Bank reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may appear at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the group's CEO wishes to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving his duties.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything that is foreseen in the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with a abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about.
One in two would solve the investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires of 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 percent found that it was legitimate for Deutsche Bank to propose investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many bank clients would also benefit from personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one out of two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected in speculations on raw materials.
43 per cent would not recommend such a bank around them, 49 per cent answered that they would reflect on the termination of their account to change their bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian Pavilion for the World Exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then collapsed.
It is now again open and takes place of the exhibition house.
If you are excited about a modern post-war architecture, its clear forms, glass hangers, its lively and daring features and its new building materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal Brussels exhibition in 1958 is a good example.
The Schwanzer Pavillon was once given the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is still considered an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavillon for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four cylinder house of BMW and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous internationally in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the station in southern Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was used as long as contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly weak.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavillon, now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the museum Belvedère opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance at any point of opportunity.
The new departure was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedère.
Husslein-Arco has promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things, in his youth as an artistic skater, subsequently at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founder director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she has led in particular to the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, she has obtained public funds and private sponsorship and has established the exploitation of it.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited, a coffee shop and a bookstore are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the Krischanitz realization, it was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and sensibly expanded Joseph Olbracht's secession and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "mostly every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and his change of use.
In the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a gouffer in energy," Krischanitz said.
The window profiles of glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced glass fibers were set and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.
The thermal bridge beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a light panel slammed between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge led to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but always the light Pavillon Schwanzer.
The exterior doors of origin have remained, the house is painted in a shade of red-brown rust.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision by the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"There are materials that are good and cheap to be found, and which also please the monumental protection office," said Krischanitz, and he draws attention to a rough ground in the ground.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Jardin Suisse stands precisely the "quartier of the central station" again planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance is perhaps going to happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg purchased the Berlin temporary art center, and as he said, it already negotiates with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million extra this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported in advance by invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should also allow for better availability of vehicles and rail networks in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the denial of rail facilities and quays is expected to double and increase to 16,000.
The aim is to rid the snow and ice docks up to the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the necessary track equipment for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the Rüdiger Grube Station Chief warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that took place this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacked other reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For many years, many new regional trains have been awaiting authorization from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years had to do what to do, as it must have the axles of the ICE trains clearly more often at the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE in the central train station in Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is again in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were not already sufficient, the past of this sector giant also caught him in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison to $145 million (€106 million) to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator carries a series of charges to large banks, encouraging cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and led banks downhill.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution in this regard, without the parties entering a court proceedings," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank did not recognise any errors in comparison.
This is also valid for Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCAUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. co-operative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
NCAUA is trying to repair the damage incurred by several billion dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks aside and in summer he assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents, this is "Deputy-backed Security".
Credit homes are at the base.
When the US real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, it is currently blowing a stormy wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought numerous remedies to seek redress or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the largest wave of complaints.
She complains to 18 major international banks, to the two US real estate finannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be in-kind advantage in mortgage business of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with FHFA, which includes several operations totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005-2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but, however, without mentioning a specific amount.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increased by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance gourd, invests colossal amounts in the IT company of IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares for a value of more than $10 billion.
Until then, the American big investor Warren Buffett has been constantly explaining how to invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad predictions.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his views on investments in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier than IBM proposes mainly services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight attack in the financial world.
As a result, the IT IBM activity is granted the right now to be known as "Mr IBM".
Car Buffett revealed today at the CNBC economic issue, that he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IMM never knew anything about this commitment until now.
He commended management, who had made reasonable profits even during the economic crisis.
"You did a super job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been spending some time on IT profitable services as a business of accounting centres.
The computer pioneer, over 100 years of age, offers both Software and consultation as well as highly performing business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he invests only in businesses that he understands business.
But on the contrary, Buffett is attacked rather by rail brakes, lubricant manufacturers or machines.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as parts from a wide range of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rück municipality.
This 81-year-old had resumed in the 1960s the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and had erected it in the ranks of one of the most prestigious world companies, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
Following Buffett's investment announcement, IBM shares increased by one percent to the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also called IBM, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is visible
After the discovery of Zwickauer's cell, Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would be reborn now.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish people react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks the spectre that was believed to have been dead for a long time has re-emerged its appearance: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this extreme right-wing context against the Turks.
However, there has never been a question of xenophobia in Germany.
The right-wing extremist network, which was detected, however, reveals proportions of which the dimension is far from predictable.
"This is a return to the bloody ideology", "Tel was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors would have been a man of the protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right bubbe.
It was reasoned that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at Brandenburg's door.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought of a ceremony on the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a history of success.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a gifle: "the gift of Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of the unique conditions.
"it begins at the beginning", such is the title of the Ahmet Külahci chronicle.
He pointed out that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was critically perceived on the German-Turks forums and they subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why has it not already come much earlier in the minds of the German authorities to do research in certain suspected extreme right environments, the authors are surprised.
More than one shows itself ready for at least rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be broken, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defence and armament."
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Inland peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," says Selen.
What this means if inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here than there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance by acts of violence could result.
The attacks, however, have helped us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes
In the past it was mainly the failure of the German policy after the attacks by the Turkish press that claimed: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of the Turkish State, he was represented at the funerals in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was counting at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how much the distrust of many German-Turks is profound towards the "state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of greater clarification and reassessment of extreme right terrorism in Germany, this time a clear message is needed.
The scandal bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial and skate crisis in the meantime from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After its spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was known in July that it would occupy an almost as spectacular position in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Great Swiss Bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recent strength and made a pleasant comment on future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded in the Turnabout."
"I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, from September on, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities merchant in London had diverted all the Bank's security systems and had burned about €1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since been considered as suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the Presidency of Administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economy and president of the bank, and he would certainly need a period of adaptation.
At the same time he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the biggest scandal bank in Europe".
In fact, the UBS is on the one hand enormously - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing seems to spare the proud Swiss bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, quiet and solid, but also Russian, had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a very large bank in the area of banking investment.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former Banker Hans Geiger and later a long-standing bank teacher in Zurich says: "I have always taken the UBS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"In today's perspective, we wonder: how could I have just cheated at this point?"
He's been deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something didn't turn around at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising manner, which until then was regarded as a high intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later we felt what the reason he left was for.
The division of the bank had burned down with subprime documents and had to cross billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross over.
For this she actually found investors, but which, a short time ago, would have rubbed the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which had passed under silence, to the extent that its name had never even been learned.
But that was only the first time.
In April 2008, this worsened.
The bank was to announce again losses amounting to billions, the president of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still the second most paid board in Switzerland in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and was rescued by the State in view of its investment errors.
The national bank purchased tens of billions of problematic securities from the UBS, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds into shares, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet for the UBS 2007 increased to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We couldn't save the UBS once again," says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second disaster followed.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy clientele, who had cheated the tax possibly with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in reimbursement of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that it has helped to tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
This is followed by the withdrawal of the Chief of the Board and the President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management because of tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a bit of a calm return, and as we thought, the UBS would come out of it, it followed from this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single flame market of EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank realized that something didn't turn around.
And we publish: with investment bank risk management it still doesn't seem to work.
"In the case of Adobe, it has been found that the control of risks has not changed much," said Martin Janssen, a economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is sure of this: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not control the risks at hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their place, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unbreakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich is still going to match with the solid private Swiss bank cliché - it's just a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its seat at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Zurich Lake, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's are found here among Swiss stores of tradition like those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the palace of Crédit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a great label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other withdrawn from the market - or betrays the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would have become too big, it finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the morals of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, made high profits and then the break: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of the subprime as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday the small country's government coalition of seven million people has undertaken the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The Fall of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks together concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for little Switzerland - and has steadily increased.
What helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a more poor, but of course already more highly internationalized.
At once, international investment banks have had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the ascent of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly president of the board of directors.
"I've always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who set a path to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted himself until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group always made the same point of order: dethroner Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" classifications, which documented at that time the success of the banks.
After all the U.S.U.S. wanted to climb all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of currency and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
The business advisors, who were responsible for it, however, pointed out a weakness: in international transactions of interest, in the bank jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS launched in an adventure, which almost cost it his life.
As with growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. subprime investments that invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed value documents based on American mortgage loans - but which also retained risks.
Even when other banks had been looking for a long time to go down.
"Even in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was on fire, the U.S.B.S. bought there," says Geiger, the bank expert.
The more euphoria the greater the fall is brutal.
A manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to attempts, it turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and are so far bank.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: to end the investment bank, to concentrate on the management of goods, to return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want to go so far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as much as it is clear to date.
Next Thursday the bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-suisse was only supposed to be transitional when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has imposed: it must carry out the affairs of the UBS on a sustained basis, the Banque de Zurich reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to progress in the mid-1990s.
He cancels 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has already asked.
He says publicly so far only that he was going to look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the American stock exchange
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week has discouraged US investors.

U.S. investors have spoken skeptically: "We are not an island, on the other hand dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, and there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: "it is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early in its view to invest in obligations arising from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a ten-year-old principle into the wind and entered the American technology industry.

Smart corneas spread out in cities
In many places, brakes are considered "bird problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals have not been hunting cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cornels have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are multiplied because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
During the first Ostfriesisch symposium on the cornellas, experts said that it is no longer possible to chase the friars from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature-protectors were also based on the problems of cities on the exodus of specifically protected brakes: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional living spaces.
Hunting, setting and slaughtering of typical cave trees made life difficult for birds.
The horns are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 concave pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative publicity because of the cornea massacre in the region.
Critics found bird capture in traps and killing them with particularly brutal gourds.
"The normal expulsion, the avoidance, is useless," noted Leer's planner and landscape, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressure water or to kill trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr at Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals go away, the great colonies divide and they disperse in other places."
I can only imagine in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of animals' avoidance to a thorough conditioning and tight offers to allow them to reinstall themselves elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "info panels instead of stretchers" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-chemining-educational of the ships at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing the lives of these very intelligent brakes.
In the meantime, the project was adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of bird noise: "There are a lot of communications, these birds have a lot to say about."
Animal intelligence and skill are legendary: Frewls do not only use working instruments to reach a ruler but they themselves manufacture their tools as working tools.
Ethologists at Cambridge University recently tested four brakes, to what extent the intelligence of the birds comes.
In an experience, the birds quickly learned that they had to build up a scaffolding with stones in order to achieve a larvae.
Without much training, they firmly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second test, the cunning cornellas then had to solve a deeper problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larvae.
Birds could not reach their target with their beak.
However, the researchers had put iron wires at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four brakes were even successful from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo pulls Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks were unsuccessful.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czechia and Ireland will also participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czechia, Croatia and Ireland bought the latest tickets in the 2012 European Championships in Poland and immediately eliminated Ukraine.
Directed by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal turned against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0th of the match, its fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the game return elimination by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been obvious.
Nothing was also burned in the zero 0:0 match between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) off against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72e, 82e) and Miguel Veloso (80e) marked the other shots for Portugal.
The former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with 11 metres of penance played by hand (41e) and Captain Emir Spahic (65e) made a double shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a red yellow card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the World Cup 2010 eras in South Africa in Portugal.
At Stadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal has had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a 30-metre-in-a-front free shot in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his fire performances at a distance and fired at a distance of 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to attacker Edin Dzeko.
Ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of Manchester City's English championship, initiated a bullet directed down the crossbar, the balloon did not cross the line of purpose (33e).
Jiracek drew a goal for Czech
Finally, referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the centre of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian Penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card in Portuguese (36e).
On the other hand, Stark granted a penalty of 11 meters played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, Europe's Vice-Champion of 2004 succeeded four times and everything became clear.
For Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also had the chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9e).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the Stevan Jovetic duo and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to the shot of Cech.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the aid of the world-class Czech custodian who had already been shot, once again, the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The short-term goal before the end has finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink also had to abandon his seat on the bench of the third EM in 2002, the Croats were able to rejoice over their fourth round at the end of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan marked the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball for the purpose.
After the time of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62 e Minute, the legions of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish have celebrated their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already taken care of with a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) has equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at the top speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first chance.
Only at the last moment that the defence of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the - the first buyer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of the goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and will lock the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (€1.5 billion) will be allocated, said the Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," announced CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader of enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
To date, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The slaughter of personal masses
The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that warms your heart.
A hint to begin with: carefully tear this page and make it your own page-mark.
You will learn about these people in detail. In this Romanesque account of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here a book out of the ordinary which he accurately described as "an anti-history book."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is hardly any ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it could look like." There are the "feelings, impressions, experiences and humours."
"Beauty and sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from both sides of the war, from young students and botanists to hikers, going through doctors, ambulances and salesmen.
Some will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose their members, they will become crazy or they will lose their lives.
Their lives vacillate here like the nuns of a church: while some of them turn out, new ones come up.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
It refutes the idea that the First World War is summed up only by the terrible war of trenches on the western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, the Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under the cliffs; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as a Hurricane Katrina who can cord it.
When cannon blows remain far away, and when you are a mother at home, do you stay or flee?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been enhanced by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracyist theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English feed in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are primarily drawn from memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them address deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund wrote: "Ersatz, everywhere Ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep's fat (and finished with a false wood bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried skin of potatoes; seeds of wooden shoes."
He states that "837 authorised substitute meats are recorded in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse to savagery and says about war: "You feel that after all, it's what men were destined for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, reading a newspaper or best-seller, and rather than claiming that such varnish is synonymous with civilization, and there is no barbarian behind your heavy and nailed shirt.
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he is at risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are reluctant to sacrifice ourselves, we hope to have an audience," he wrote.
Unfortunately it's rather comparable to "a man convicted secretly."
Other comments concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," wrote Peter Englund, "a war among the factories."
He seizes the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the beastry of the early century: the mass murderer articulate and ideologically convinced, in well-cut clothing, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act in an unexpected way; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and spread on genital organs in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness for life."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way in which the war has " triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion."
People start wondering why their leaders are making them a war.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West Nothing New", by Erich Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming that I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come up from his book, grab out your hands this page that includes the list of people and burned with a lighter.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some carrying helmets.
The night Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all the errors of a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the department's regulation and generated a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared by observing the conduct of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorism measures that consist of moving quickly a large number of policemen - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park were reached "at the last minute," said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I knew and who were called didn't know they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones to know that they would go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city has managed to hold a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police wanted to clean up the park but had been pushed back by hundreds of demonstrators informed of plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the area - dozens of officers used to serve in particularly criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going to the park during the day, as migrants, so one hour in the morning was a convenient time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and messages recorded by speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
While community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue cutter, many protesters simply gathered their business and left.
No attempt was hit before 1:45 p.m., which left time for the occupants to gather their affairs.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson of the head of the police department, claimed that this measure had been taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention within the park, which was rudely withheld by the officers.
Browne said that the television cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police were moving west across the heavy business of demonstrators, including luggage, plastic lawn and sheets filled with clothes, teams of the sanitation department followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
Ten people at the epicenter of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, said Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
There was no arrest in the park before 3:30 a.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most of them for "strengthening in public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Department of Police, is the highest-graded officer to be found on the premises.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "he was not managing operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were patient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were planted on Cortlandt Street, a pastry house in the north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south.
The police have seen the perimeter widen well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, had even been seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
About 5h00, south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped on the top of a police car. Others were seen breaking down the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood popped up in the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The school aid union continues the city for layoffs
The union which represents hundreds of school aids that have lost their jobs last month plans to bring a trial to the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools that receive disadvantaged schools.
The prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school aids, parents' coordinators and other employees, being part of the city's least well paid, lost their jobs on October 7. The union leaders compared these dismissals to political revenge for not letting the city access to a health fund led by workers' groups, and which would have enabled them to close the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this charge.
At a hearing of the Municipal Council last month, Chancellor Dennis Walcott said that the dismissals were part of the closed budget in June.
One member of the Council replied that the dismissals of school aid were not specified in the budget.
The Council officers of the 37th District stated that they would meet a notice of complaint, warning the education department that it would be pursued; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions to the Manhattan Supreme Court of State.
Dennis M. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be the respondent. The complainants will be represented by eight laid-off workers, all of black or Latin American origin, like most of the school aid that has lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the legal department of the city, said that the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore could not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union sent the number of redundancies to schools in the most disadvantaged areas of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfinancing.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school grants have lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts in the southern Bronx districts.
Noting the loss of five school grants out of eight employees at Harlem's 36 public school, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecutions state that "It's not a well-off parent district that can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget for public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each underprivileged student enrollment.
The union also claims that school directors were able to be misled by certain terms in a memo allowing the dismissal of parents coordinators.
The memo used the term "exhaustion" to describe the action, even though "exhaustion" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "Six parent coordinators have been fired", and "not just because of overrun".
Mission concluded: Congress finds agreement on the question of Libya
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats had reached agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It will take a successful uprising, capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Kadhafi as well as the American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision on Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republicain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Undependent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their rebellion and the American troops for their "heart".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving the military role of the United States in the NATO mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill has been defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and has never been voted in the Senate.
But on the same day as the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The American mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress was sufficiently upset to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under foot.
Congress's indecision was surpassed by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed on 20 October last.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "welcomes the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "welcomes the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as in June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Richard D. Lugar Commission (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the project.
In the Chapter, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatta (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other question, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have not so far succeeded in getting their amendments approved, but it is not without trying.
The Goodlatta amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to be tabled at Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations in a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the Chamber only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but they give their support - in particular the new Republicans who want to suck their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, approved last August, called for the vote of both the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to raise the limit of two mandates for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is proposed forever, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the annulment of federal laws if two-thirds of States are opposed to it.
So much so that members have been able to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The cadence slowed compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed at Congress in 1789.
"Massacre but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man pulled him off at Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday night on a television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said he wanted to go back first rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared on the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The "emission approached his difficult return after the bullet that fractured his skull and penetrated the left side of the brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified his recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords replied "soon well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of an hour of "20/20", broadcast on the eve of the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special show has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the 8th of January shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he was shown on his hospital bed, shaved head and a wide scar on the forehead.
She can only use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords was sitting in a wheelchair while the doctors taught her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word is, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with doctors, said not to remember the gun.
According to her husband, she was reading an article on the March 12 shooting when she stopped her and asked for the first time information about the six people killed in the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There were many deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
At her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I've been beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get out of it, get back and get back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie suit stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, the spring fundraiser.
A military high school present at the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, head of the U.S. Army Staff, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They have been presented as a sort of orphan," wrote the military high-grade in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But that was not respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praises are provided to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they declare a few soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if it is sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops of the Vietnam War has been much worse.
For example, most conversations about mercy take place in all confidence among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they have been confronted with insurgents and have traveled to distant territories.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran was hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who made him spend the interviews asked in a subtle way if he would be able to take a break under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you approach the subject of service, you face negative impressions," says Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a country that is so unfamiliar with the army and that sees little direct advantage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," said retired lieutenant general David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
The troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The Army in the face of increasing pressure to deal with rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
The first-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant on the night she claims she was raped by a soldier.
C was in October 2008. She would return to her barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a beer pack.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"C" was an alarm signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, thrown down and raped, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still on duty and others not, will eagerly await the decision of justice at a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and that will decide whether a trial against the former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 25 women and 3 men in the following months, all claiming that they had been sexually raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claimed that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says he's taking care of the galloned soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Counsel also states that since February, it has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future legal proceedings.
Her strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, led by US lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a decision of the Supreme Court in 1950, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active staff.
"The alleged wrong is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicates the documents.
The Department of Defence has refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not, officially, have the right to go to battle, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male only.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's troop teams play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
As a result of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernise itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in conducting this fight: three other trials are taking place in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Centre prepares a case against the four main military academies to encourage a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America non-profit foundation prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of "personal disturbances" attributed to the victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group tried a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for those who claim to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were registered according to the Department of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The March report also examined the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of the cases recorded in the army were tried - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her aggressor - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat in front of a judge, at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as witnesses of morality to the perpetrator of the crime, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was rendered," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions.
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commander, "It wasn't his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was returned in less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any advantage.
Whether Lyman and the other complainants will move forward or not is a long story, says John Turley, professor of law at the Faculty of Law of Washington University.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army lies behind decades because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence as the responsibility.
"The chances are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when good people want to fight.
If the trial does not go in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will bring together hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who shared his anti-immigration opinions online.
Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged having been taken from a murder madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time prior to the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... log in on Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS reflection group on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook boasts so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
The Jamie Bartlett team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. It targeted them with announcements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the announcements invited users to respond to an investigation. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those that associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
DEMOS' study is just one example of how Facebook became the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Thinking groups, medical researchers and polytologists use the site to study all the topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I like", publications on walls and updates of statutes.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "supernova of data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose site name appears in the title of almost 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a means of identifying and addressing health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Mr. Megan Moreno of Wisconsin University, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits had a lot more chance of being alcoholic than those who were discreet about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would be too often talking about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behaviour and Development of Children at the Research Institute for Children in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses information from its users.
The database team studied statistics on the situation in love and on the day of St. Valentine's Day, the participation rate in the mid-mandat elections in 2010 and a national index of happiness (due to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they have not even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than on the Internet, it is something else on the Internet.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologists at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study that he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going over the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a block-note and pen remain the best tools to use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social, it is not in front of a computer."
"Froid et inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Temples of Norway," he explains in front of a audience room filled with 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it, because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, speak to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondences for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor on the Norwegian NRK TV channel.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He watched the journalists and the survivors in his eyes coming in and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance", the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he has acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some of them.
But this does not reduce the pain and confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I'd rather he look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"That would have been a lot easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing himself from the engineering and inventor of modern computer science.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on major markets, is how much this creative spirit understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself to a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an improvement of organizationals - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "sickness letting them think that a brilliant idea makes 90% of work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a complete video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly reassembled, is the base of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast at the cinema Wednesday and Thursday next.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems amazingly enthusiastic here to expose technological philosophies and its commercial strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a specific answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism rises, where he seems to be eager to hear Cringely's questions, kicking him in to speed him up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, we find a strangely accurate aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he views as good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computer science.
It's one thing to read Steve Jobs' posthumous evaluations of career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision about how things can be and must be.
He explains them and then puts them into action.
Here is a quick summary of seven outstanding Lost Interview sequences:
On how he learned to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'Oh, just because you have to do them.'
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to provide details of his efforts to simplify Apple accounting.
Perplexed about how the costs were recorded - often started with a "standard cost" measured with nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells of the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack the telephone networks and to telephone free of charge in long distance.
The device was written many times in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, passing a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped up the ball of different things a half a dozen times and you shouted in the public phone and it would come a minute later on the public phone next door," Jobs explains by laughing.
"We were young and through this Blue Box, we learned that we ourselves could create something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We did not know much, but we were able to invent a small thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever exist without it.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night, turning to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the U.S. diplomat, the two accomplices are going crazy laughing just before the Pope himself is awake.
On his love of technology (and release from Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, in the spare parts hunt to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and put him on a wire.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. C" was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first ever designed desktop computer."
He was as big as a suitcase, owned a small cathode tube. I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At various times in the interview, Steve Jobs is talking about making new products on a head shot.
At the beginning of his career, as he settled down to sell some printed circuit cards, a client asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, he should take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of finished equipment.
Later, at Apple's, he recalled difficulties in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... I was raised on it claiming it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I came out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that would be incredibly reliable.
On large enterprises that are experiencing:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders were going to cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's admit that you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copyr or a better printer, and after?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these types of people] that end up leading companies and specialized product staff are set aside from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product from a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have made ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a brilliant idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, electrons can do, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is to try to expose you to the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and that great artists fly.
We're always ashamed of stealing excellent ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who have just proved themselves the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas eat with health law opponents while the court meets
On the day that the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the issue of political discord, namely whether the opposition to President Obama's health law would be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that would defend the case in the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question involved a trial by 26 states that challenged the reform of the ambitious health care voted by Congress last year, a law that had been a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5h30 is expected in March next, and the result will probably be in a position to encourage the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be on the rise at the time the court decision is made.
The lawyer to be held before the court and will argue about the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as a solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The Legal Office of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen cabinets that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's (Federalist Society) annual dinner (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial issue in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican of the Senate and a declared adversary of the Health Act.
The guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing going against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fund collections of law-related and other organizations although the judge cannot be an intervener , an honored guest, or on the program of such an event".
However, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the business's law firms, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, is sufficient to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"Judges drank and ate and collected gala funds with lawyers who have cases in court."
Their presence and participation in the fund-raising of this event stems from any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court cases with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a top-profile conservative activist.
The Conservatives also claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general solicitor of Obama's administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the level of the court of first instance.
His critics put pressure on Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she had invested too much in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for online aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, two-way line aircraft, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, an estimated market worth over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order covering 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is a whole case when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 planes reaches the record sum of $18 billion.
Also incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, an increasing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In published forecasts on Monday, Chicago believes that the airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft with a total value of $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
It was the Dubai-based Emirates airline that passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 additional aircraft, which would increase the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated on Monday that the company Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts important fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than $1 billion.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil increases, said Dihora.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The Emirates command reinforces Boeing's dominance in the wholesaler aircraft market and helps to curb the Airbus competitor's attempt to mount with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Fair comes four months after Airbus' announcement to postpone the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus rejects its beginnings to increase its growth as a result of its customers' demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing company shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican President manifestly fought in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo du PRI in the race to the governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to access Michoacán's governorship in the course of violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers had favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI, was in the lead of the race to the position of governor of this Western State.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on radio during an interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officers... they got polls, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only recently emerged from Calderon, who was at the head of polls before the day of the election.
Calderon, a candidate of his brother's Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, who currently serves as governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the presidentials of 2012 for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former Mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet violence has persisted.
A week before the election, a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally because of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections were aired, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to prepare to help the euro area out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growth in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indulgent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent the long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain point but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, nothing prevents them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan is dangerously raised in arrow and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece resigned.
The growing crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has fuelled the fear that the world economy will be in recession, and has called on the major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag said that the IMF would bring any Asian aid, but he also said that bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the US financial saving fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a drop in exports and a slowdown in foreign capital.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to meet and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where will we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very politically difficult to make Europe eligible for 1.2 billion Indians, of which at least 800,000 live with 2 dollars a day or less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and that they go on holiday in the sun and have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many Greek officials well paid in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area was likely to cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD's forecasts of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "relief plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and major capital leaks.
Strong warnings from the Pentagon on potential defence reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget compressions would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, through civilian rallies.
The Pentagon already has $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more compression will be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditures.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry," said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from the so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"An equally important reduction, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and inexhaustible construction projects - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm the other modernization efforts," writes Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would possibly affect combat troops, continue Panetta.
"Although the financing in wartime of the accounts of contingencies abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support war".
"The staff managing wages would be reduced, leading to delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defence would have led to a rapid decline in the United States as an undisputed world leader in military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," said senators in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to occur."
That the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about the possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the highest position of the Pentagon that brings years of budget expertise to Congress and the White House and knows that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a soldier with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers able to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could " generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said some of the biggest defence projects could go to the cupboard, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the F35 Fighter Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new land vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the Navy.
Putting an end to F35's development and testing could generate $80 billion over 10 years, but its supporters say that it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Find a Lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how misleading and lying are ubiquitous in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for the presidency Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been accused of wiring for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The New York Congress member and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, went on to make an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of campaign funding related to the coverage of an extra-husband link.
And then, none of those who have experienced history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered while lying during his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The school and university tests of cheating stories are legion.
There have been instances where teachers have given the answers of the tests to students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a particular day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are lousy lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have carried out an in-depth research of such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths on the lie have been demystified.
The liars look into your eyes.
They don't swallow, pray or don't always bother.
Do not conclude that liars are hard to detect and hard to expose.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation and time of answer.
I have spent many years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are skilled at reading others, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people less often lie to their partners than unwed people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you're perceived as a disbeliever, the others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "setting the benchmark data."
This helps to provide a point of reference to measure subsequent changes.
Look at the posture of your subject, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone usually removes his feet permanently so as not to make unfair accusations when you see him kicking his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for hints of verbal and nonverbal deceptive behaviour.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Lying people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards a exit, change their posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated breath of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions are passed.
Questionors often falsely indicate that the interview is just finished to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, watch out for your subject vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson broke up using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceitful individuals can also use a distant language: "I have not had sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" in his answer to a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember good... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be hijacked after the U.S. threat of late approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - which aroused the anger of the trade unions while calming the environmentalists - the oil pipeline company says it is prepared to redirect the project to the rails.
TransCanada stated on Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Chapter of Nebraska.
TransCanada Officer Alex Pourbax says the company is confident that it will eventually obtain the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it received further studies of potential itineraries to avoid areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, vast sources of groundwater.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have reversed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although staff members denied the policy involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries of Texas.
In order to do so, it would have to cross six States.
He is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have put on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to this plan put pressure on a law to force the remoteness of the Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The ongoing Department of State Environmental Impact Study found that the project would only pose limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the department's general inspector ordered a separate investigation into the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist committed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hilary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice from its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit with fear
A New York family claims that the Diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched in a riot of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point of she vomited her fears.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" scared little Geneviève Monk, 18 months old, so much so that she suffered "from personality changes, sleep disorders" and "great fear of strangers," said her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10th last year while stage technician Kevin Monk, his child garden teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to leave on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the hall of their Boulevard Riverside building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped by the door and put her daughter for a while.
"Someone came after me and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said "yes" and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle angryly warned the pregnant woman.
"She told me of an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to him, "what you say or think doesn't interest me."
It became rooted and began to use oaths - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling from the bottle's water.
She said that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who always kept Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surroundings that drove her to a car waiting for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so loud that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but no response was received.
Lawyer and LaBelle representatives have not returned our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damage, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially towards a mother-in-law teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate Adversity Has Stopped the Economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year to be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-appealed for change, which has generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate crisis of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, apart from the loss of billion for the agricultural sector, have limited the opportunities of the State economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development's ice-cream allocation report, there were damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, and the main harmful crops were vegetables, corn and chic peas.
The decline in economic activity has resulted in a steady rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the State's unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year has seen an accelerated increase, as from January to March 55 thousand 053 signals were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate has become 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average has continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by public policy actions.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment which is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources approved by the legislation of Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work for them to earn, invest and use them in something," he says.
Migration in detention
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the State to go to work abroad in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties in entering and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, which makes unemployment rising," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labour market is worse by considering the high level of serious lack of working conditions that predominate among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works without contributing as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for disqualification for the state is low wages, the entity has lower pay in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much less than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI Contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment in 2011, the highest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment for the past 10 years was recorded, according to the Economic Secretariat from January to June, the State FDI has reached $630 thousand 697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5 million 143 thousand 312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Government of the Government's Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, mainly by the tertiary sector companies.
The debt
In view of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested approval in July of a 3 trillion-weight credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the state congress was 2,600-billion-weight and until November no profit was observed for debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the employer sector, the first year of government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has been really very poor, it is necessary to work intensively to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, it has been necessary to align the effort of all and above all the good already synchronized walk of this new government team, hope that next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the ice creams of the beginning of the year have retained the state's economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flux is produced by several events, including ice creams, one of the main effects was a slow economy which does not turn quickly enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level and flow in trials, products and services and, therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he says.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Urorte, President of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that it is intended to channel the State into productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms, we have observed that we have worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa be detonated," he says.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better guide the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in different areas of economic development there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that much has been done and that the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to be done," he said.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marihuana
One resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and 100 days' fine for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the small convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offence against health, in his variety of marihuana possession for sale.
In accordance with the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officers on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker circulated in a pick-up truck, white, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle trunk and on the copilot's place a small backbag where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Legal Consequences Enforcement Centre.
Debt to contributions to the works
Social literature seen in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants may not be finished where there are serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has failed to meet its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that the total investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, from which the State is required to provide 25 per cent and until now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They must provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have given us nothing, even though since July they had to give us some of it," he said, "and we, to not record any delays, started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration, the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the 7 million that the government had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and programmes continue to operate and this year, in order to be able to access these programmes, we had to obtain resources to cover what the State had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment by the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages would arrive as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end, they have not given us anything."
The Court valid "analogue cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has emerged from the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue cutup" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes required to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutional or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft award, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the decree's declaration as a non-constitutional, because radio and television regulations are a statutory assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and statutory reservation.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and to admit the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of Ministers also resolved to terminate the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project of which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures to be prepared by the public administration.
"I also consider that if it is done, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, who has the constitutional mandate of the government.
Substituting analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years and this results in better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To adjourn the change, he said, would adjourn the benefits of digitisation which implies a decision of public interest which not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of a whole system to establish, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, a group of powers which the Constitution grants to the Faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the highly specialized technical organs.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of Congress in one form, as it ensures in the administrative sphere that the laws issued by the Legislature are respected.
The possibility of a vote discount in Michoacán is analysed
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of "vote by vote" count is a reality with regard to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Pre-Trial Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either its Constitution or its Electoral Code of State or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the Congress of the State has approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral process to enter into force and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has omitted his publication within the time limit provided for by the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms, as he does not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that with the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the IEM General Council, it will be possible to make the partial and total discounts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no poll record and count in the ballot file is not in the chairman's case; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all polls of the election may be made when there is an index of the fact that the difference between the alleged candidate who wins the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the poll is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition by the representative of the party and/or coalition who presented the second one of the candidates reported.
The total voter count may also be made if at the end of the joint count it follows that the difference between the alleged winner and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate has gone out second, in which case the electoral packages that were subject to the partial count will be excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of Morelia's election, where according to the PRSP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without accounting for the 129 votes of the 923 total minutes.
His final will
Its ashes will be spread in the Zapalinamé sierra, confirming the family.
The remnants of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, and Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a mass of rest.
According to his family, the Lieutenant-Colonel's last wish was that his ashes be spread in Zapalinamé's sierra.
After receiving tributes from others who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the lieutenant-colonel's ashes arrived at the guard chapel of the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends went.

"He wanted to return to Saltillo and his ashes spread in Zapalinamé's sierra, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considered that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and he cared much for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people could not believe it, because they said he was even sick of a truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving an aircraft.
His last farewell.
With honours the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, tribute to Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Institute of Technology of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, next to the government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of this service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés, born in Saltillo, arrived at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the splanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Caderyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media 11 persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found killed with fires fired in different parts of the body and with grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Caderyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of Cadereyta road in Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this place observed that in the property, whose closure has beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, at about three metres approximately, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At one meter distance there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were spread over the belly.
According to data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, as no in situ was found.
At the close of the property there were legends directed by one group of organized delinquency, apart from a few bullet holes in the property and in the portal.
11 captured in Caderyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Caderyta and who were considered to have relations with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine inhospitable inhospitables.
According to the information published, in the first instance on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros eight persons were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
They were confiscated three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, the military personnel made a monitoring course in Rancho Viejo, Caderyta, detecting a car without registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 2:00 p.m., one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadreyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on board the economic disaster
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on board the economic disaster and put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A communiqué from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet consisting of technocrats in his majority, even if it is not clear when the new executive assumes his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly state that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The frame is now well-traceed," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normally, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels that are impossible to support.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets to place the yield of the Italian BTP obligations at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronage Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDDP party, to which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," he said to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the majority technocrat government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could result in a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy in Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups, youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his tour of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano on Sunday, which enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief review at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now come back to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would give it only time to implement reforms before the elections were made.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections to a process driven by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties complicates the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is greater than that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 convoked participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 countries convened by the two countries for today's Amale, at 15:05 a.m., at San José's National Stadium.
While national and European champions, the number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide register of Class A interselection games, the Tricolore only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England, keep an intense activity in national league and coup championships and in European Cups such as the Champions League in the year.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup of Football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have limited international experience in an area such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goalkeeper Immer Casillas, who on Saturday before against England (defence 0-1 in London) has equalized the record of the former goal guard Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas today will play against the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, brain wheel of Barcelona, 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the week before UEFA next to the other hundredths of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front-centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Charging the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the editor Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five were over the 30 games: Kelor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
Those with less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar only has one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not begin.
The historic editor of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will also become a dream to happen in this country.
It's because the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively to Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its celebration tour of two decades of work and on Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
That day will be on the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles Group The X and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcript of which is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I spent only once in Costa Rica; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
It therefore warms us to carry our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity the days before.
What is your message for your more ardent followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry that it took so long to this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the biggest shows we have offered during the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We have offered two giant shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that this has formed us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends were always going surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; so we learned, through the people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you have offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never worked there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What do you owe yourself to?
I think it's partly because we have nine disks and we can play more than 120 songs and each one loves different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to play each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't interpreted for a long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes also more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock band, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is very moving.
We love and love creating music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be any better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunt?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very close to the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of Seattle's group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we attended a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we are lucky to be still friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of this sound of Seattle that emerged.
It is also very strange that a group like yours will stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned with others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to each one to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and that could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what it has done, without putting the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn't really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We've been a group for almost three years and we haven't published a record before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration about the fact that she lasted so little and most importantly is the fact that we are still very close to Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture I think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas national group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose him for opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer on-line and that must be very distracting.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbeter's words live for?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's the one who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
Somehow...
Among the first ones I remember is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to maintain the grunt despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney now do the best music than ever.
At first, its music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change due to?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that are qualified as very obscure songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, they probably represent that for me.
I also think we can also be happy and even so we can make music obscure.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in the feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during her Government (1990-2000), is suffering from various conditions, including a cancer of the language for which she has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, stated for TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasmic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he did not want it because he felt he was innocent.
It has been performed four times with language cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as a severe erotic gastritis, a pancreas cyst, kidney stones, arterial hypertension and circulation problems in the feet, have listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Police Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of a squadron of annihilation of the army that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political links
An official court, chaired by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and employers, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proprietary for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French agent Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group formed from the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of the tax exchange agreements to exit the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), composed of countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004, a Free Trade Treaty (CTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The lead mostatchu passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought, untiringly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the bad Bowser's claws, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at shops around the world, has been designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopic without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", because so far successes like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" were adaptations of the existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the weakest users.
Once surmounted, the most expert will be able to make a "second round" at the levels of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, which was no longer happening since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes a look at saga's followers and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that lead moustachu must travel thin platforms to release Princess Peach.
Even if I'm a player, I find new things in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in Luigi's "playful" cases.
Colom supports the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the money laundering of 70 million US dollars.
This concludes the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called for Portillo to judge it.
At the press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term of office "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had taught all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did implies an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former deputy of the 2004-04 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for the diversion of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial prior to extradition, but the Public Department appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 youth at risk
The entity was born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The assessment of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
In addition, the long 100 jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make a balance sheet in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping untrained, unemployed people with problems of drug addiction or marginalization.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of officials of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, during the electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work performed by Trinijove.
On the side of the President of the Regional Catalan Government (Generalitat), Arthur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act of former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor to the mayor and current Eco-Social Councillor Richard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended in the large Fabra i Coats room.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the present one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it performs," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 apartments of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of the 51 Street Balmes lived ended.
Twelve people left yesterday at noon voluntarily the building they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-fests that were desperate for neighbors, in judicial order and without need of police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From this day on, there will be access control," said the administrator.
Squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of that of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained for Europe Press that as soon as the occupation of the building its business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation facility had to respond to neighbouring complaints about the noise, while, according to it, the riots were not caused by the clients of the discotheque, but by the occupants of the occupied house and especially the participants at the parties there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbours of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the trouble was so great that it even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it's been nine months since this "forgive him" rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
The president of the mayor's PP municipal group, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the common and civic problems caused by the city's residents and the deterioration of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
In this sense he added that "it must end with impunity and be implacable against antisocial behaviour generated in the property."
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to 35 rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the opportunity of convening beyond the controversy about fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
By the mid-1980s, in full support of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed promotional posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also had a numerical comparison with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that doesn't orient itself on the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (mer).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is in the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with straps in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door goes back to the park idea, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared all by itself: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation by all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former elite class speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, academic professors, have come up with.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coast front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of the pasta of green houses has not been completed.
"We must leave the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", gave the verdict to the architect for whom the title of "ports of Collserola" contains a "lexic trap": it is not to think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as "intelligent challenge" with "some perils".
Perils derived from the "uncertainty of projection of the public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and had in the Forum area "his singing swan".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step", that is, its overrun.
"It is necessary to think of new urban planning instruments, as the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)) can cause real disasters."
With more attention to the question, Modol feels that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "does not have to be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the mayor offers to her corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doute" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success", he says) that we have to create: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the basis of the competition there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "The 16 cross-sectional contests have been convened - he says - in the direction of the mountain-mer, but there is no longitudinal reading that goes and understands the area as a whole".
This, at least in this case, has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project for one of the doors to collide in the program and define with that of the architect of the neighbouring door.
In her opinion, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately exceeds that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the founded legal power of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the legal power of the Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a blackmail trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack by Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic fee for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the illegal operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Parquet opened a criminal trial against the brother of Mayor PANiste and on 2 September the latter was arrested and held in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Department 3 of Patrimonial Offences, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the following 49 days when he was given a second order of detention after the Public Prosecutor's Office had dismissed the corruption and organized crime offences.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal centre allegedly for having made the Casino Red owners sing with one and a half million pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the middle security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest warrant was issued by the Clerk of the Second District Penal Tribunal, Jorge Yanez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as that relating to the impeachment of 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the game house in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's agent, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who were partners of the gambling house had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under the 197/2011 case, legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claim may be filed concerning the trial brought against him; no compensation will be sought for damages and no punishment either.
After the hearing of the founding of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate freedom that the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome reports details of the air accident in which he lost his life the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven others
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results highlighted the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter has hit the ground directly in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contact with the soil, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that the investigations carried out in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In one research, it has been reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact has been structurally presented.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the Secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation may last a few months, it may even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Aid Services, ensured that the moment of impact, the state helicopter Presidential Major was operating at the speed of cruising and this happened on a rolling ground.
"This information supports the assumption that normal operation will crumble at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, TBS licensee Pérez Jácome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned appropriate conditions for take-off, and as and as the aircraft moved towards the border area between DF and the state of Mexico, there were layers of low-level nebulosity.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the nebulosity conditions the crew sought a lower and more visible area of height towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remaining parts of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available to date allows us to assume that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral path.
The aircraft residue dispersal model allows us to assume that the helicopter has struck against the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
There is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple ground contacts.
During the field work, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, with a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
Photographs show the sequence in which he was possibly disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a larger area than the surrounding area around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the assumption that the impact took place in structural integrity conditions.
MSS ad protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by NPI specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Assurance (IMSS) announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of the obesity of children and adolescents' that will allow the markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialities Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and third-cycle students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvesav) from the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate in the population with or without the right to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valle de México, where the evidence is given to minors every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sport Unit (State of Mexico West) and that as of 8 October, the activity takes place in the Sport Unit of Nezahualcoyolt (State of Mexico East).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Independence Unit (south of Federal District) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (north of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that is to know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
As will be celebrated on 14 November on World Diabetes Day, he noted that the objective is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and history of family heredity of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that Saturdays will be applied to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of size), blood pressure, glucose levels determination, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetics (one seeks to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity in boys and 47 per cent in girls; in overweight, there was also a dramatic increase in overweight, the IMSS specialist said.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the others by its genetic history.
He informed that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent indo-American inheritance, 30 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in Africa, and this is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics translate into the inability to burn the excess of energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full evaluation of children, which allows them to detect if they present a degree of overweight or obesity.
It even says that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearms indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and doctors write it back to parents, to whom each explains the measures and changes in the lifestyle they have to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use of means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is high calorie intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - meat pulp to corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would prevent the cassia
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs were resolved, there would be no need to repair about 200 thousand cassia each rainy season in the Métropolitaine Zone of Valle de México, Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemie (FQ) of UNAM, which ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous pavement is adequate, the cassses could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on the cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory responsible for it develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the yield, and consequently, the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the paving its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and 50 degrees C it has a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, adds.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City in most of them were covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and compacted later.
Each of the small stones that forms the layer, pointed out, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through with efforts, it allows the forces to propagate very well into the pavement.
If the asphalt was modified, the asphalt would propagate better, as the chemical engineer did.
On the asphalt layer, he says, we put a last layer called rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
Since this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
As the part of the deck that receives and distributes the efforts, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made of is to be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, as they significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil is wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to do so, which blows all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes the cassis.
In the process of forming a cassis, he says, the first one that breaks is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that needs to be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Searcher System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of the deck must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent training of cassation.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair cases easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Colombia Miss?
Analysis of factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna to fail to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives its title number 14 as a princess.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle with the fact that she was on the winner's podium, wearing the crown of money and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico was mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the already 14 titles department of Princess and Melina is one of a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garces Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Visage Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to appoint First Princess is the fact that she did not believe with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the response of the Valle candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Câtement", it's a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Dredge of Blood".
This answer does not first because of the term "culturalize" and secondly not to explain in concrete terms how each quoted book marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, read, please, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the assumptions made is that Valle was destroyed by favourism.
A Bogota journalist suggested that being the preferred, the ovation, and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (the Oster gastronomy challenge, the public's vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "he woke up the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage."
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Although she had felt sure of herself at both parades, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program (Comme à la casa), of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury of its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Competition of Beauty.
That is why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for an engaged woman with regard to her country's social needs.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by its defects in its back and the fibrosis that was observed in its abdomen, but this is contradictory, because the jury specifically chose it as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the body healthier, good food and responsible physical work.
The Queens' Preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better bodies, "but his fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which actually had not been too well known to me, left him points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, considers that the error of Valle's candidate was the surgery she had undergone.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this."
For this prize, which the National Competition of Beauty returns for the first time, after the swimsuit parade arose a cruel prediction that was accomplished last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo gave Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali dactyloscopicist went to history like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these staff members is crucial.
On November 4th, a CTI dictator of Cali went to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Seven dictators working at the ITC's local offices, this week was the "availability" tour of Eliasar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after following proper courses, he specialized in dactyloscopic, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano we warned Eliasar to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one was suspected that one of them was the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much smaller.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galton magnifying glass, ink, a picker and a lantern, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye did not wrong him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the one who confirmed to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the Supreme Leader of the Farcs.
Looking for the print
For a dictator of Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliasar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know about our work.
Dactyloscopic is an accurate science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from identifying dead bodies, dictators support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many offenders have false identity cards or do not have any documents.
We take their fingerprints and searches in the database.
The researcher said that in a flight case he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in this place the thief had held his hand to get out a safe full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint on it, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of all our hands and identify to the offender who had participated in different flights," he recalls.
Prints may also rule out or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent can be suspected of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it puts him on the crime scene.
One ITC dictator explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a picker or band is used to pick them up.
Subsequently, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declimate database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He explained that everything is not how we show in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not of gold, everything you touch doesn't necessarily become a fingerprint.
It can, however, be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignants" defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were bouncing in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people went to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupe Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to enter again, through a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Pomme.
Hundreds of demonstrators were bouncing in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allows 'indignants' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to evacuation by occupying a more northern park in the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the spokespersons of the "Occupe Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the 'indignants' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indigents' occupied a new park at the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which united New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church parish.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray could not confirm the actual figure, ensuring that he saw a few journalists who had also passed handkerchiefs.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support of members of the movement and has tried to intervene in their behalf before the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property facility - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
A few displaced demonstrators so far carried and distributed copies of this order at that time and even delivered it to the agents monitoring the place, which caused 'some small clashes', Bray said, which denounced the fact that some officials had hit the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupe Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the start of the occupation or from prohibiting demonstrators from entering the park again with tents or other properties they used earlier'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, to whom he had warned, however, that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councilman personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided on account of the fact that the protesters 'violent the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm others", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn has been repulsive and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers," he added the spokesman for the movement, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The officials of "Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not think to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television program of Noel
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", a rock musician's wife Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Canadian TV Noel.
CTV's private television channel announced today that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Marie.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crib a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" appeared as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, the CTV's special Noel program also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who, at the end of March, married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not himself far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan Renewed After Earthquakes · Global Voices
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, and it is still conquering after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses at $300,000, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, the data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September have been used to turn the page permanently: GDP has reached 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at annual rate.
The second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of the capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous increases.
However, the real incentive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, use the deficiencies for zero-croit.
Japan has mainly woken up from the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable has grown by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The sigma of the yen
Tokyo went back to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "values" elected by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the United States forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a datum in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, accounted for their low performance between July and September for yen contributions.
While the markets continue their seats in the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not drop custody.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen, have to be followed," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are hampered.
For it has dropped four decimal points to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in output.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, not falling eight decimal points to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds doubts
Papadimos said the adjustments would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to engulf the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional Government is imposed rather by Brussels' demands that a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday, indicated that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days set in his designation may be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, made sure that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the planned date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," said Papadimos when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not raise any doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else."
The Conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the organizations that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and clearly said that he would not approve any letter of commitment for the implementation of the adjustments.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the whole Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the leading Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have much to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasises Spain's "preponderant" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that in the past two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "pesence" lies in the fact that it is an instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being."
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the V-e World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015 and, "very particularly, in the one that aims to reduce the volume of people living with incomes under one dollar a day, to which the "poverty threshold" is set."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and takes on this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originated during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and the best opportunities for the poorest and especially women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We "have achieved a lot of goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families come from the poverty line in which they now live.
The momentum in the design of microcredites in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering manner" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she had known 15 years ago when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project gave her yesterday the qualification of "the head of the family" gathered in Valladolid from the "bank of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía finished her speech by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits assume "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "of trust" to people "exclusive to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, a chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for the programme but was imposed in the fall, in particular to satisfy the activists who judge the government's policy too laxistic towards the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, following their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave any doubt.
The idea-master of the chancellor - and of the motion - is in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less than Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "time has come from a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
This is in any case one of the proposals for the motion adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Sept will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile there and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also so.
But the heel is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country to the European Central Bank's Director on the basis of the weight of each economy, which obviously increased the weight of Germany.
In order to ease the climate within her party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has also not sought to win her congress on the backs of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty soon to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in crutches.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent in the case of medical arrests?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government are launching the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and to give a speech on the theme - repeated since 2007 - of combating social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts with a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less announcing an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on the stops of illness.
First of all, for budgetary savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day's shortage on private employees before the end of work.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, an employee who becomes ill would lose four days' wages, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could give rise to anger, but which would yield €280 million, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another, more symbolic measure: to impose on civil servants a day of non-compensation in the event of a cessation of work (they do not have a period of shortage until now, compared with three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunchs the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work arrests.
"Controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will repay," Xavier Bertrand warned the RTL micro on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at work.
This has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are not sicker than they are in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NCAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditures in 2008 with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% related to sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
And so 2.5% of health expenditures.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the Career Management Site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they did not take any sick days.
Another study, this time of Sickness , indicates that in 2010, 37% of disease cessations were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer inclined to stop work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France, between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud of disease arrests is very low in the face of black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, it is limited in scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on disease judgements of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term closures were "unjustified or too long" or 37,050 cases.
In the case of stops of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of "inadapted or unjustified" cases of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unjustified" cases, therefore, out of millions of employees who have had a sick stop.
A figure that represents very little, for example, the one from work to black.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the matter in June, it would amount to EUR 9-15 billion of tax revenue per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to correct its economy.
On Monday, November 14, the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, in front of Parliament, said that the hundred days given to his union government would not be enough to do that task.
"To continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader on the right, gave his support on Monday to the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage in an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with Members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and of combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the loan of 8 billion euros necessary without written guarantee from all the parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says an expert committee
Canadians live in the denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of a major report of the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada has ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, they report to us experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire for most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring at the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that they do not want to change anything to the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, which have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted by non-compliant or non-consent persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, said yesterday, there would be more cases of these spillovers precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie says.
Euthanasy Canadians
Let us recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow people in the end of their lives to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the life of the elderly or disabled is less valuable.
As for persons who have committed assisted suicide, the respondents felt 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect an end-of-life refusal without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that it be considered, when it is not intended to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some health law experts have already issued reservations regarding the findings of the report of the Royal Society of Canada experts.
But Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has described as "extreme" the position of the report's signatories, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to those who are terminally ill.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to place the individual's autonomy above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society," he says, "there are beacons and constraints."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifesta".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly challenges the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where assisted euthanasia and suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Ladies denounces a conspiracy
Syria is increasingly isolated
partisans of Bachar al-Assad showed yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry premises.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bachar al-Assad Syria, who, with Russia's support, resisted and denounced a "complement" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand for President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdallah II was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad "out of power" in Syria where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bachar had the heart of his country's interest, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, deplored the failure of Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot please them will leave," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country where Turkey adopts an increasingly tough line.
The United States welcomed a "enhancing the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey are becoming increasingly harsh" in the face of repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
In the meantime, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime died in the Deraa region in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians perished "from shooting and piloting exchanges to heavy machine guns in Jobar" in Homs City, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Moualem nevertheless felt that the country was "turning towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from her work, which he believed constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria will not "flash," he added, ensuring that "ourish plots against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers in the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also welcomed the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believed is confined to paranoia.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in connection with the challenge and release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Serguei Lavrov yesterday judged the Arab League's decision "incorrect" while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while maintaining its support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
The demand for time in Italian markets and sacrifices
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a little time in the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the unions and the employer.
It should set up a relatively small office consisting of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the interviews, after meeting with the President of the designated Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, expressed his hope that Mario Monti would request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will be concluded with Mr. Monti's submission of a small list, probably one dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock market and compulsory yesterday, demanding time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "somewhere the markets will be patient and will understand".
Its designation by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern had been raised, in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, even though he stressed that he would like to include "political".
The new government is due to last until 2013, when the next legislation was adopted, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti undertook, once he took office, to work in the emergency and in the aim of Italy becoming a "prominent" in Europe.
A spokesperson from European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, called for further strict measures.
The Italian "patron of the bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of serious" and another "Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place EUR 200 billion in state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specialized in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents emanating from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week on its "serious concerns" regarding a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Ural, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamond by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diaminants" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would have subsequently cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA refers to "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during the core of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Crimes and anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence has declined slightly or little, according to the FBI statistics made public on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, representing 49% increase, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews, and an overall increase in 14% of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased significantly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," said the organization of human rights rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be seen as a serious violation of human rights," added one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he added, adding that this could result in an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual membership.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site introduced on Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to enable its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes their service a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allows you to follow more easily, live the activity of the other "Twittos", netizens that follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast across the network on Monday, told AFP Twitter's spokesperson, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its instinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to broadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the initiate happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable approach to that of the large public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users then debated tweets about the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better follow certain elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
Inclusion of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to enter into the constitution a budgetary "golden rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thereby avoid any deterioration by the rating agencies of the Austrian sovereign note (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision following a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt was 74.6%, largely above the maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced only from one skull, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest more every year," said the Vice-Chancelier and Christian Christian Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria therefore responded to a request from the euro area member countries in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017 onwards, the federal public structural deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities will have to submit budgets to balance.
The aim is to move public debt under the 60% criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty to 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens a new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the exchange market if the yen were to continue to mount.
"We will intervene as we did the last time if we find excessive volatility" at the yen exchange rate, explained Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went back to the historic levels that pushed the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of force since 1945 against the green ticket.
But yen has been steadily rising since, made up of purchases by investors who regard it as a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is broken down on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro has come down under the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar quoted around 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
This proliferation of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago because it has earned the cost of Made in Japan and reduces the value of foreign income by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan's struggle to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), said Mr. Noda who feared that this prize of the yen would not kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The third world economic power has renewed with growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in one year, thanks to a rebound of exports and consumption of disaster-leading households.
But the Prime Minister found that the wealth of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for his part called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of his monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution's Deputy Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary relief was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Emissions Institute increased by EUR 5,000 billion (EUR 47 billion) its purchases of Treasury bonds to EUR 55,000 billion (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to inundate the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The rates climb, the Stock Exchanges flange
The risk of contagion in the debt crisis always undermines European indices.
Despite the designation of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and higher growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Always worrying about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little further into negative territory on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10h, CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new strains on the yields of euro area borrowings in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains ".
" Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down by 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed market concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow variation corridor until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, managing funds from Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved at its lowest level for one and a half months.
Around 10h, the European currency is worth $1.3570, reflecting 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she withdrew after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion, including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian bonds at 10 years of age is 6.85%, that of the Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time in the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the " main task" of his government.
Spain is on the market line, while legislative elections are held on Sunday in the country.
The difference in rate (" spread ") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new higher historical level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
The statistics show that France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, which is driven by household consumption.
Insee, however, revised the number of the second quarter downwards, with a decrease of 0.1% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
And it's really the fourth that worries the most about economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11h, while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must take it to the dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the "emotions", it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the role of nuclear power.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their views on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, the demographic evolution will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless it deprives a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, fossil resources will need to be reduced in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate deregulation, a missing subject of environmental debate.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which submits itself to the need to be able to find a source of replacement capable of replacing itself, nor with Switzerland, which simply intends to build only last-generation power stations.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but one of them, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by taking over the construction of a power station interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is contrary to speech.
The choice of Berlin will be to increase the price of electricity, an energy dependency compounded by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions resulting from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these negative effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be studied.
The European champion of the wind, whose electricity is 30%, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind intermittentness; therefore, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee for the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of nuclear power would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would illustrate the excellent statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French refuse to pay, as long as they do not show opposition in principle to this energy, polls show it.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has built an industrial industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it generates a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and makes them very creators of non-relocalizable jobs.
If France had just decided to come out of nuclear power, it would have sacrificed many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a skin of sorrow.
What electrician would command an EPR designed to run sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be acknowledged that there is no source of miracle electricity, nor is there any evil.
The development by Areva of low-emitting, nuclear and renewable CO2 solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a Safety Authority that exercises intransigating and transparent control over existing plants as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same security obsession.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear industry suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failings caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two unprecedented natural disasters that have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wishing to build a power station, the stopping of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to seize leadership in the undisturbed development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy stock for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate a debate that is also decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - including police, judicial and administrative services subject to the statistics policy, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "countries of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
There is a rather broad consensus between the left and the right on this subject.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't host all the world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by Polish lead hordes was shared on the left as well as on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that immigrants will receive.
In his program, François Hollande cantonates with banality, indicating that co-development will solve our "migrant problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electoral payout; but it is economically very expensive.
As noted by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration disrupts growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may substitute for domestic workers, particularly low-skilled workers, exerting a downward pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly in jobs in sectors with a shortage of employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the offer of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country that has a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows results in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
This does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, in Germany, an immigrant aged 30 will make a net contribution (less-expenditure receipts) of EUR 150000 to the average public budgets throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, serving to deter immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, still thinking about European democracy
Democracy is a very valuable thing; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, in order to have invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has experienced the tragedies of the Great War over the 20th century, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some have been able to believe that it would be sufficient, in order for democracy to definitively succeed its enemies, to carry on the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner whatsoever.
We know, from Napoleon's "The Little One", that it was a simple thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and may even become "an instrument of oppression" as once said the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, the Lights, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum will have had the value of double revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic combat have now moved away, and that for many of them Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized on the basis of needs and in dispersed order.
A white-seing to the European absolute monarch or a jump attached in the void of the nationalist reply: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want coupons, but a common exercise, of full law, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we can no longer see where to stop the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bends to the dictatorships of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the piloting of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free markets and prepare the future by investing.
The crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, except of course lead to disaster.
After fighting this Socialist and Jacques Delors proposal for a long time, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Sort of.
But thinking of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" the republicans.
The Revolution in Interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe on an economic level.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
The "no contact" smart cards are generalized
The world salon of the smart card opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% of world sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or settle your purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to make further progress in 2012 (580 million expected units) and to represent nearly 10% of the overall smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long past the Asia-Pacific region, Europe gains ground for the free payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double caps.
Carrefour issued this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed themselves to systematically broadcast to their customers of bank cards equipped for contact without contact in the future," says Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for carrying out transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally know a real boom next year."
"Our tables on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 around the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhone of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare the market for an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobiles.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Alger has now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which the two organizations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without more detail.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January would have been updated by the gateways.
Kidnappés in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their admirers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the debris of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several hotlines belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls passed oriental to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, a cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" have been increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and speeches or in his operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosive devices that are increasingly complex and as much as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account Boko Haram's problems.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of illustrious people of little interest.
Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haousssa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It politicizes and requires strict respect of the sharia while its militants engage in the fight against the central government impious.
They first target churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on the police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
So the sect will radicalise itself and leave its fiefs in the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took care of the police's secure QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information" .
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplicity and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying the thunderstorming declarations and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often untapped - were.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them "to manipulate their currency", a moving theme in America that was excited by the entire migration of its industry to Asia.
Even worse if it should involve the outbreak of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador in China of Obama and only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that "flats" the emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who lies in the depths of the polls, remains unheard of.
In Reagan's Image
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he's faking."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to this partner.
Contractor Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows a embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he was calling against the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trys to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has owned the military atom since 1964!
Governor Texan Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to engage the US army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy burden in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say that Reagan also had simple ideas and he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to put water in his wine with regard to anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the very early departure of Iraq's "boys", on its tergiversities in Libya, thereby attaching to it a low label.
But the attack is not that easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security balance, which has eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been suspicious of military interventions that lead to a landslide.
And, arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more just.
The North Stream, the new Russian gas port in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, connecting Western Europe directly to Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, went into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with bursts.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on Tuesday, on the Baltic shores, between orchestra and fine buffets, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects Russia directly, under the sea, to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Filon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first 1,224 km tube connecting the region of St. Petersburg to the Land of Mecklembourg-Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we already mention the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction site has air of victory.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will enable gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to the West European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security from its supplies.
But it is at the price of a weakening of Europe of energy, since the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has been able to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are declining.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Filon by opening this pipeline, demonstrating how political and economical the major gas contracts are.
This explains the broad smiles displayed by the Gazprom leaders, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical operation.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-gained steel to protect it against ships' anchors.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
In order to build it, mines from the Second World War had to be avoided.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed by caution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for North Stream.
There was also a need to multiply the measures to protect wildlife and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts all its length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A monitoring platform was planned off Sweden, but project managers gave up on it while the Swedish were reluctant to see a Russian state society permanently settle off their shores.
"In the event of damage, we stop passing the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline is thus leaked into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds to escape every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by a submarine robot, trained by a ship, for external observation, and by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
Of the form of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide by one meter diameter, and is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, it provides accurate information on the possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to run 50 years without having to suffer the least repair.
Gas circulation is simply driven by pressure.
It is 200 bar at the beginning, and 100 bar at the arrival.
Five companies joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, holding 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It has its seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to this company, for twenty renewable years, all of the gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their fees, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters tall, form the gas exit door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, this terminal has received a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand name card.
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to taste the writing.
It has a perfume of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves with a broken white colour, as if aged by the time.
Yet, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo company, based in Milan, decides at the time to launch a book of design notes but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The carnet is inspired by an old production technique, the skin mole (taupe skin) which means a paint cotton used to cover banquets for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
" Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, up to the 20th century ", says Maria Sebregondi, who has become responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
The success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first few years, where only 3,000 cartoons were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robust portrait of the buyer, as the notebook of notes seduces both businessman and student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, accounts for almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from Fnac to the small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies Moleskine's development: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own books.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and its cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer covers... The brand has a wide range of media.
A success that made the envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy set up in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the whole population.
Discouragement?
"No, Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the Association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled."
" The progress made over the past 15 years has been considerable " .
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"It remains, however, enormously to be done."
It must be said that for the disabled, the obstacles remain many before they can get to employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the bach and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for people with disabilities, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that specifically complicate the return to employment, and which "are the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for objective brakes.
There remains the non-declaration, the mindsets that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City indicated that the interviewed managers have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychological or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment objective of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of... 1987.
The last known figures from 2008 show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
" But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of businesses from 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "How happy"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday evening (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match brought them.
We won't even write that there was conniving between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the highway of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made peace.
Five months after the mood gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian picker only has praise to do about him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, with his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian."
"I want to go ahead," says Lillois.
As for the contrast between his club and selection benefits, "it's all, it's justified."
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Made against Romania on Friday evening in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "briller".
However, without omitting the notion of "luisir".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of seven and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
It is therefore involved in further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
Especially in front of it, "there's Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We've crossed so far."
"To play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens has for his part referred to the "kindliness".
"Fertty" to fight "a gala match."
"Fairty" also finds - as "near" - that France has become a very high-level team just over a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a job of thunder," he became enthusiastic.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be able to share the plane with the Blue direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians become great," he pointed out.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to report it to you in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimistic about its return to Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams lacked realism.
" At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selecçao, which has been on hand since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to blow up.
In view of the match go (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it was obvious that the games were not made.
Portugal has dominated the part for more than an hour, of course, but it has been unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk because we didn't have an aim outside."
But at home, in their luminous Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even though the party obviously announces itself "very tight," said a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We're waiting for a very tight game, but we're absolutely convinced we can take the top," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012," however relativised the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The reported null Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
No one can suffice for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk, because we haven't got a mark on the outside," says Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you're realistic this time.
