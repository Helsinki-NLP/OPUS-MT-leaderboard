The members of the Council (AM) Welsh are worried if they "have hit like a muppets doll."
There is concern among some AMs about a suggestion that they should be changed to MWPs.
It arose because there was a plan to turn the name of the Council into the Welsh Parliament.
The AMs throughout the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite excitement.
An AM labor party said that his group was concerned, "It's called a union with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the council (AM) said that his group as one unit, felt "not happy" and had suggested some alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group "open thoughts" about the change of names, but judged that this is a fight from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, your letter in Welsh is spoken as u-letters in English Yorkshire.
The Council's current committee has set up laws to introduce the change of name, says: "The last decision on any explanation of an am term is of course a problem for the members themselves."
Wales' decision 2017 gave the Council of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published a public consultation on a proposal known to be widely supported to refer to a council as the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding AM’s problem, the Commission is more fond of WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Parliament Welsh), but MWP’s option is gaining the greatest support in public consultation.
The AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could set up the chief, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the plans for the changes in a few weeks' time.
This reform will include other changes-- changes on how to work in writing, including rules disqualified for AMs and committee system design.
The AM will get a final voice on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the guests.
Macedonian society went to give a vote on a referendum on a change in country name
The voice owners will determine whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonian Republic."
It was held in an effort to resolve disputes for a decade with Greek neighbours, who also had a province known as Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country to the north shows a confession to her territory and has repeatedly rejected the EU-NATO membership offer.
President Makedonia Gjorge Ibanov, a voice-response opponent for a change of name, has said he would ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, felt that the change of the name was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bell bells were undistorted when the churches in Harlem were having trouble.
"Historically, the parents I spoke to say once said there was a bar and church in every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, there's none."
He said that all those bars could be explained.
"People socialize in another way" now, he says.
"Bar is no longer a community guest room around where people visit him regularly."
Likewise with the church, he was worried that money from the sale of assets would not last for long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would return from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by an apartment building filled with condominiums that would not help to keep the sacred places around it.
"The majority of people who will buy condominium in these buildings are white," he said, "and so it will speed up the day when these churches are closed together because it is impossible for those moving to these buildings to become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became a city of black metropolitans - metropolitans in 1870, St. Martin’s, a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church moved in the 1930s.
Black mobs who have been worshiping around the area have taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black church under the leadership of President John Howard, who led a boycott of the skyscraper on 125th Street, the main road to shop at Harlem, who refused to work or promote blacks.
The 1939 fire caused the building to be heavily damaged, but when the Johnson parishioners planned to rebuild, they built tower bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of P. Johnson and his replacement in St. Martin proudly called the bell tower "Lanceng the poor"
An expert who rang the tower bell in July called it "a cultural heritage" and "an unchangeable historical instrument."
One expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also notes that this is the first tower bell in the world played by black musicians, Dionysio A. Lind who turned on a larger tower bell in the 18-year-old Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin for the last few months is a complicated history of architecture and contractors, some brought by regular church leaders, and others brought by the episcopal excumens.
The vestry body - the executive body, formed by the public leaders - wrote to the constitution in July with the concern that "will try to burden the costs" on the vestry, even though the vestry is not involved in the architectural recruits and contractors sent by the execution.
Some parishioners complain about a lack of transparency from the faculty.
Hiu injured a 13-year-old in lobbyster rescue in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobster in California in the lobbyster's opening ceremony, at the expense of an officer.
The attack occurred before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in the Incinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then rowed together to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a thrill after catching lobster, but then he "knowed" that the boy shouted, "I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
Hammel said that he realized when he got the kid.
"I screamed to everyone out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The kid was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was dealt with in a critical condition.
The species of shark in charge of the attack is unknown.
The captain of Larry Giles Beach Rescue said in the media conference that a shark had been seen in that area a week earlier, but it was identified as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim had a severe wound on the top of his body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinity for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most of them are considered harmless.
The sciencebury plan hit the English beauty market
Sciencebury takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beautiful kios-kios styled toserba style managed by specialized assistants.
As part of the substantial push on the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling fashion products and household equipment down, the larger beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more shops next year if it proved successful.
Investment in beauty is a mere hunting ground for the supermarkets to use racks that used to be used as a place to hang TV, microwave, and household equipment.
Sciencebury said that it would double the beauty offer to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of brands started from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more room with a brand-new area as found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also launched a reintroduce of the bouquet of the boutiques so that most of the products would be friendly to the vegans - things that the young shopkeepers are increasingly interested in.
In addition, the perfume chef Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions at two sciencebury stores, the first opened in Croydon. London south of last week, while the two will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Online shopping and repurchasing the daily needs of food in small amounts in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the executive head of the Sciencebury, has said that the gestures will become more like the Mall when the supermarket chain is trying to fight back the encounters like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and without food.
Sciencebury has placed Argos' movements in hundreds of shops and has also introduced some Habitats since they bought those two warheads two years ago, which he said has supported daily food sales and made a more profitable acquisition.
Previous supermarket effort to renovate beauty and pharmacy departments ended with failure.
Sciencebury tested the work with Boots in early 2000, but the same work ended after there was a dispute about how to share the profits of the chemical store in the supermarket.
A new strategy appears after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of Farmasi Lloyds, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding to the various brands of beautiful leather treatments including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sciencebury, said: "We have changed the look and nuances on the beauty kios-kios to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our trademarks are designed according to all the needs, the surrounding environment, and the comfortable location, indicating that at this time we are an attractive destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "shut up" after Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a £11 million deal.
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones went "with a temper" after TV star Holly Willoughby pulled himself from a living style business deal worth £11 million to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage the branding of household equipment and their accessors, Truly.
This couple's business is likened to a Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Ptrew.
This Morning, 37-year-old carrier, uses his Instagram account to announce that he's out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons' star" Den, Petes Jones is madly attracted at the last moments, from their lucrative lifestyle business--to focus on his bigger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was so "strong" when the golden girl TV admitted during a cold meeting on Tuesday at his office at the state of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - meaning he no longer had enough time to devote himself to the brand of household equipment and their accessories, Truly.
Their business has been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptoutrew and is expected to double Willoughby's wealth of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his holiday homes,
One source says: "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
That would be his long-term future, which would last him for a few decades to come.
His decision to step back makes all the people involved very uncomfortable.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready to sell."
Experts believe that the travel of this Morning's event, which is one of the most expensive British stars, can hurt the company up to millions of dollars because of massive investment in product form, from pillows and candles to household clothing and equipment, and there is potential for further launch.
And this can mean the end of a long-standing friendship relationship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and Tara Capp's wife for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent shares on Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the carrier of ITV's title I'm A Celebrity.
A narration close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speak seriously ‘ and then we fall in love’
He's joking about the criticism he's going to get from the news media because he makes comments that some people consider to be "non-presidential" and has been very positive to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump hand over so much?
Trump said it was his "new reader" with a funny voice.
"I don't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting two times after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which was praised by Trump as a step forward for the development of North Korea.
But the negotiation of incriminating has been halted.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, the highest diplomat North Korea Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at. The UN General Council on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "appropriate responses" from the United States against the early North Korean arms delegation.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued its determined sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump's more optimistic about his speech.
"We're doing our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight North Korea.
Millions will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship,"
He said that his success in repairing relationships with Kim has brought positive results - stopping rocket trials, helping free hostages and returning remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crazed arena, we better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing towards the crowd that's right in front of him.
Indonesia’s Tsunami and the Swarm Destroyed an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of the Lombok lost their homes, there was no declaration of national disaster, as a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've made it clear that they don't ask for international help, so this is rather challenging," said Mr. Summon.
While Save The Children is teaming up to go to Palu, it's still not sure if the foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a national disaster relief officer, said that the Indonesian officials were examining the situation at the Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute aid.
In view of the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, this country is still very unprepared for the anger of nature.
While the site of tsunami protection was built in Aceh, it was not a public view of the other shoreline.
There was no tsunami warning siren in the Palu, even though warnings of danger had already been reported, it was likely to contribute to the existence of life-threatening victims.
At the best of times, travel between many Indonesian islands was very challenging.
Natural disaster makes logistics even more complicated.
The auxiliary hospital that has been located in Lombok to care for the victims of an earthquake is on its way to the Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach a new disaster location.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs on the broken Indonesian infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on road and rail development.
However, the funds were disrupted by Father Joko’s government while he faced the next year’s election.
Mr. Joko also faced the pressure of ongoing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where Muslim members of the majority had adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes when Muslim and Christian hordes fought on the streets, using ropes, bows, and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge entered a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea at the Premier League with one score in a minute to 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside the Chelsea glove when the team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before kicking it to a distant pole.
The ball floated high on top of the cage when the ball plunged to the right corner over the net.
The ball finally fell past the Riszabalaga Kepa that jumped and fell into the net.
"That's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it in front as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," says Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just do a kick."
Chelsea led with 1-0 score at the first half after Belgian player Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue attacker gave a feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before turning near the middle line and running fast to the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gives the bait and runs in the middle.
He then made a perfect kick, led Hazard towards the gawg.
Hazard managed to cross the oyster and kick the ball into the corner of the ghetto with a left foot kick, pass the Liverpool Kiper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fought Napoli in the campaign of the League Champion group on Wednesday, 3 p.m. at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faced videotons in UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday, London.
The death victim of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The death toll on the earthquake and the Indonesian tsunami grew to 832, the peaking of the country’s disaster agencies on Sunday mornings.
Many are reported to be trapped in the ruins of buildings that are devastated by a 7.5-scale earthquake of Richter that struck the Friday and triggered a 20-foot-high wave, says Sutopo Purwo, an institution speaker at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which is home to more than 380,000 people, is filled by the ruins of a collapsed building.
Police arrested a man, 32 years old, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Murder investigation has been done after a woman's body was found at Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44 - year - old woman was found at Grayson Mews, John Road, at 7:55 a.m. with some coughing wounds, while a 32 - year - old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked people around to see or hear something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still at the earliest stage, but I'm asking everyone around John's road at Birkenhead to see or hear something suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may record something on the flight cameras to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
The police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is the local Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt sure that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still going on like what the police have said, they're in the process of telling their closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just returned to his apartment, but told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
That man can't say anything when he knows what's going on.
Now the citizens are being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer sounds to tell someone that all areas are now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the location in tears.
She's always saying, "This is so awful."
By 2:00 p.m., two police vans are on the line and the others are on the outside.

Anyone who has information requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, phone 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by quoting log 247 on September 30th.
The statue of the Cromwell Parliament became the last memorial of the re-history re-writing.
His expulsion would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban against many British artifacts and religious actions by fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell's society describes Mr. Crick's advice as "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: "This cannot be avoided in the current debate about the destruction of statues, that figure Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster's palace will be targeted.
The British brothers' war iconoclasm was neither ordered nor done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell offspring would be sacrificed for Thomas’s previous acts.
The extraordinary representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a 19th-century evidence of opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed to be worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against outside pressure, in case of course the kingdom.
Whether it's a completely accurate representation, it's still a subject of the continuing historical debate.
which is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the next nation's development, and Cromwell is the one that can be recognized as an individual representing one side of that difference.
His success as a Protector is also worthy of celebration.
Killer Pigs Ending Chinese Farmers Until Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to a local media report.
The man, who was identified only by the name of his trademark "Yuan", was found dead with severed arteries, covered in blood near a pig cage at the Liupanshu province market in Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject a vaccine to the pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province Qinghai, China.
She was reported to have gone with her cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, her cousin found her dead, and saw a pig's door nearby has been opened.
He said that in a pig's cage there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that a male pig weighing 550 pounds has persecuted the farmer until he died, based on reports.
"My cousin Betis bleeds and breaks," said the cousin known as "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security cameras show Yuan entered the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed that man is not a Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was already locked up to prevent anyone from attacking, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the reported market authority are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attack against humans have also happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts caused severe injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig grabbed a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife was afraid and drove the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were usually non-aggressive but blood aromas could act as "a trigger".
"They're just playing games.
They're biters, very curious to know... they're not going out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's storm brings heavy rain to the west of the United States.
As expected, the storm of Rosa weakened as it moved over a colder river on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa would cause a flood in all of Mexico’s northern and western parts of the United States to come a few days later.
Rosa had a wind at 85 mph, storm category 1, beginning at 5 a.m. on Sundays, East Territory, and it was 385 miles southwest Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa may have moved north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the parrots began to be formed on the Pacific Ocean and moved east, toward the West Coast of the United States, when Rosa approached the border of the Low California River on Monday as a tropical storm and began pushing tropical moisture toward the north to the south of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain up to 10 inches in part of Mexico’s territory on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with neighboring marshes will create rain that is abundant in the West Day for a few days to come.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause a dangerous bandage flood, debris stream, and possibly longsorption in the desert.
Low tropical moisture will cause the temperature of the rain to close to 2 to 3 inches per hour at several points, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
An estimated 2 to 4 inches of rain is down in some parts of the West Day, especially in most of Arizona.
The flood may occur with a rapid deterioration of conditions because of the widespread tropical rain.
Very unwelcome to explore the desert by foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could cause a flood and lead to a violent stream with strong local winds and dust.
Close-up umbrellas will cause local heavy rains to part of the South California coast.
Total rainfall over half an inch is quite possible, which can cause the tiny debris to flow and the highway to slippery.
It will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will start to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before it becomes wider on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will extend to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, there would be some great changes in temperature across the U.S. when the Arctic became colder, but the tropical area remained quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes in the short distance.
There is an exact example of the dramatic temperature difference throughout the U.S. middle region on Sunday.
There was a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer’s warmth will be formed and resurfaced.
Most of the middle and east parts of the U.S. are expected to start warm in October at 80s from the South to the eastern parts of the sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate estimates show a high chance of temperature above average for the East U.S. until mid-October.
Over 20 million people have witnessed the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an exciting statement on Thursday by the so-called Great Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who alleged to have committed sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political collapse continues, with publishers organizing regular events to report unexpected events at the last minute of Friday: A deal that Senator Arizona Jeff Flake arranged for the FBI to investigate for a week on the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure that if Kavanaugh took his body drunk and tried to take off his clothes at the High School party.
Kavanaugh, in his burning testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
There are probably over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, watching it.
The company counts the average viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for another network broadcasting this is not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has difficulties in counting the number of people who watch him in the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the number of viewers who are almost the same as the playoff football or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, who thinks the host of the show is very supportive of the Kavanaugh show, superior of all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole meeting, said Nielsen.
ABC's second position with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Wanted to stay high after the trial.
Flake was a key player in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republic Party office issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being yelled at by a taste-seeker when he tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee congregation.
He was standing down for a few minutes when he was scrambled, aired directly at CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think that he told the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power when there are many helpless women."'
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee congregation.
Cable TV and the broadcast network all directly covered a few hours later, when the Justice Committee will choose to file the Kavanaugh call to the whole Senate for vote.
But Flake said he would only do that with the understanding that the FBI would examine the charges against the candidate for a week ahead, as the Democrat minority had asked.
Flake has been confirmed by some of the conversations with her friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
After the conversation with the Coons and some senators after that, Flake made her decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republican party won't have the voice to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses Brexit of 'political play'
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the “political play” critics with the future of Britain and ruining national interests, of his plan to get out of the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews showing him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed an attack on what he called a Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal about England and the EU that should raise one another's tariffs was "the least would not make sense."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police caught Dyteon Simpson suspect in LSU's death.
The police have arrested a suspect on a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and imprisoned with a two-tier murder charge, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The officer released video confrontations between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost her eyeglasses during the fight.
The police found the eyeglass at the scene and said that they found Simpson DNA on the thing, WAFB CBS affiliation reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he had committed a fatal shot at Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
Coroner's Eastern Baton Rouge parish office released a prior report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head to the neck.
The Department is grateful for the duty of the Louisiana State Police Office, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police and citizens around to assist in the investigation that leads to arrest.
LSU-Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement officer for "dependence and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old then.
Sixteen feet tall lives in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also plays basketball for LSU.
The average point he was 5.6 and blew up to 2.6 in last season's game.
In the morning, LSU coach Will Wade said his team felt "broken" and "surprising" with Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," says Wade.
The volcano crushed ash in Mexico City
The ashes from Popocatepetl's volcano have reached the southern area around Mexico's capital.
National Disaster Prevention Center warns the Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the volcano after the activity has grown in the bush and registered there are 183 emissions of gas and ashes in a period of more than 24 hours.
The center was very heavy, heavy, and heavy - laden.
Pictures on social media show a thin layer of gray that sticks to the front of the car in the neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity on a volcano that is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the city capital since the 7.1 earthquake shook Mexico mid-September 2017.
This Fire Mountain is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
The police are armed with Catalan separatists following independence elections.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a pro-freedom demonstration with anti-hurus police, and when thousands joined in a rival demonstration to mark the first Catalonia polarization event about self-sustainment.
A group of pro-separatists held by the anti-wage Hara police threw them with eggs and threw powder paints, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that would usually be filled by tourists.
The dispute also happened after that day with the police using their staff to control the dispute.
For a few hours the pro-freedom groups shouted "Don't forget, no forgiveness" in front of the cheerleader of the workers' union shouting, "Life in Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for mild injuries obtained in the protest, the local press reported.
The tension remained high in this free-oriented region, one year after the referendum of 1 October that Madrid considered illegal but was celebrated by Catalan separatist.
The voters prefer to be free, although the low number of voters with those who oppose self-sustainment and most of them boycott elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote on the GST throughout the region in a fierce conflict.
Pro-freedom groups have camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support national police.
Demonstration continues but is forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separate protest with his wife said he no longer hoped about Catalonia's prospect of independence.
"Then we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out loud because they could choose, but now we're stuck," she said.
Despite the success of a little success in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-dependence parties have fought to maintain this year despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in custody or in custody awaiting trial, for their role in regulating the referendum and next declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded protests with his phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"This is getting more nervous," she said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run in the election of the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for Europe's election is the best way to challenge poverty in the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car

A crosshole bow may also have been fired towards the car at some point.
The gol printed by Menga has given victory to Livingston over Rangers with score 1-0
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston is to secure the victory
Livingston's victory led the Rangers to fire Steven Gerrard from his position as the manager of the Iblox club, for his second defeat in 18 games.
The Dolly Menga attack has been evidence of a difference in the movement of Gary Holt's side equal to the Hibernian in the second order.
The Gerrard side remains defeated in this season's Premiership and facing the leaders of Hearts who are eight points ahead of them, next week.
Earlier, Rangers had you Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their invincible record at division into six games, while Coach Holt's head still managed defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost a chance against a sloppy guest team
Holt's team was supposed to be superior a long time before they scored a goal, with the precision of the Rangers giving them a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his efforts failed to cross the gawk face, and then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after launching and dealing with Craig Halkett's leniency across the gawk.
The host feels satisfied to let the Rangers play the top of the line, knowing that they can make a lot of trouble with the arrival team over the death ball.
And that's the way to generate a very important goal.
Rangers broke free kicks and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got rounds and scored goals from the middle of the field.
At that stage, Rangers have dominated the rule but realize that the defense of the house cannot be breached and Liam Kelly's kit is completely undisturbed,
The pattern continued until the second round, even though Alfredo Morelos managed to lure the rescue of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was beaten by the foot of the Rangers gawders Allan McGregor and Lithgow far apart from the other Livingston game tactics.
The attack continues to come to the Livingston crew and continually be avoided, while two criminal claims--after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for the handball--refused.
Livingston's 'Femenal' - Analysis
BBC Scotland Alaskar Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they are amazing, beyond hope on this ever - increasing track.
Their play style and personal almost didn't change since they came back to the board, but the big credit has to be given to Holt over the way he's been strengthening the team since he came.
He has so many champs.
Captain Halkett is very big, leading well-organized defenses, while Meka makes Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall keep alert during the game.
Even so, Rangers lack inspiration.
Whatever they did at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not good - only once they could break the formation of the side of the house - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan was given a different welcome in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky for Saturday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
They argued about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkish entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police mentioned a reason for security to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan predators - many of them Kurds - also have a voice, they have both, Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome them in the country.
The resistance protest describes the opposition to the existence of a comedian who was seen as a hero by some German Turkish people and was polled as a dictator by others.

A bike driver died in a crash involving a car in London.
A collision took place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, on the southeast side of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver had stopped and the paramedics had come, but the man died at the scene.
The crash took place months after another biker died in a runoff at Childs Street, about a mile away from the Saturday crash.

Long Eastern Prison: Six officers wounded in hara.
Six wardens suffered injuries in a riot in a man's prison with strict custody, the office declared.
The chaos occurred in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sundays and continues to run.
"Tornado" Specialist officers have been forced to deal with the charges, involving eight prisoners and happening on one side of the building.
The officers were treated at the scene because of the slight wounds in the face.
One speaker said: "A specially trained fireman has been forced to deal with an incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison head was treated in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, anti-hurus officers were called to prison to deal with serious riots where a fireman was attacked with biliary balls.
The storm of Rosa threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with a Bandage Flood (Perhapsly Accepted)
The tropical depression that hit Arizona rarely happens, but that's likely to happen early next week because of the remnant of Rosa's energy footprints across the western desert, causing the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warning of the floods on Monday and Tuesday for the region of Arizona West to South Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight past Phoenix on Tuesday, going to hit on Monday night with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned in the twitter that there are only ten tropics capable of causing tropical storms or depression status in 200 miles of Phoenix area since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm in 40 miles of border AZ."
The latest storm power plant can predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other western deserts include central Rockies and Great Basins, likely affected by 1 to 2 inches, with the possible number of isolations up to 4 inches.
For those in the open - watered region, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because of the drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainstorms are likely to benefit because the western region is currently being hit by drought.
According to the U.S. Union U.S. drought examiners, only about 40 percent of Arizona's region is experiencing a small amount of extreme drought, the second highest category, "weather.com reports.
First, the route across Badai Rosa leads to land across the California coast of Mexico.
Rosa, still in storm power on Sunday morning at the wind speed 85 miles an hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm met the colder waters of the Pacific, and for that reason it weakened its power.
Hence, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm power on Monday afternoon or at night.
High rainstorms may be high in parts of Mexico, leading to high flood risk
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is estimated to have extended the California Baja to the western region of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," reportedweather.com.
Then Rosa would cross the northern part of all of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which would cross through Arizona and to the south in the middle of the night.
"The main risk that could be caused by the Rosa storm or the rest of it is the very high rainfall in Baja California, the western region of Sonora, and the U.S., the western desert region of the U.S.." National Storm Center (NHC) states.
It is estimated that it will cause the threat of floods and debris that flow into the desert, and the land that is longs over in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton: Arrest of four murder suspects
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a cough wound in Somerset.
The young men were found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in a "stable" condition.
A 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - olds and a 20 - year - old man were arrested last night in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.

Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘received hatred and anger’ from the Democratic Party
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to refuse the assassination of the vicious and shameful Democratic Party," said Trump at a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "receives hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the process of escalating
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually violent to him for decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "The Americans saw the intelligence and the quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"One vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to shake up someone who has the most perfect legal thinking in our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he said in the West Virginia support crowd.
The President implicitly refers to Kavanaugh’s caliber when discussing the importance of the participation of the Republic in the mid-election.
"Five weeks before it happened one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really excited," he said.
"That's why I went there, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that democracy was on a mission to "fight and block."
The procedure of the first vote on the Senate level in the Kavanaugh call can be carried out at least late Friday, an assistant senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by an Indonesian earthquake, a tsunami, with increased casualties
At least 384 people were killed, many were killed when giant waves hit the shore, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami swept over the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the town of Palu on Friday when a sea of six feet (18 ft) destroyed the beach at dusk, caused a lot of death and destroyed anything it had left behind.
Tsunami is followed by an earthquake with the power of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and were not running away, so they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a speaker for the Disaster Relief Corps (BNPB) at the time of suicide in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, timbers, houses, covered everything in the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before crossing the coast.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people evacuated to 24 centers of service in the Palu.
The BNPB’s image of air shows many buildings and shops that are destroyed, bridges bent and amber and a mosque surrounded by water.
The storms suddenly shook the city along the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes are felt in the region inhabited by 2.4 million people.
The Research and Technology Service (BPPT) said in one statement that energy emitted on the massive earthquake that Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb blasts dropped in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the edge of the narrower bay, can increase the size of the tsunamis, can be said to be.
Nugroho describes the damage that happened as "extensive" and states that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of a ruined building, he said, adding that there were 540 victims injured and 29 people lost.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be larger along the shoreline 300 km (190 miles) north of the Palu, a region called Dogiana, which was closer to the earth’s center.
Communication "really paralyzed with no information from Dogiana, says Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," says the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading toward a region affected by disasters.
"This is a tragedy, but it could get worse," he said.
The instance that Saturday received much criticism because it did not inform the authorities that there was a long tsunami, even though the authorities said that the waves had been suspended at the time of the warning being issued.
An amateur record shared in social media shows a man on the floor of a sounding building warning with panic that there will be an approaching tsunami, towards those on the street below.
Within minutes of the water flow of the shoreline, the building and the car are swaming.
Reuters can't immediately prove the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunamis were the biggest causes of the electric blackout that transmitted communication around the Pallus to make it difficult for authorities to coordinate efforts to rescue.
The military is already sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but refugees are still in great need of food and other needs.
The airport was reopened just to make efforts and would stay closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The Indonesian Tsunami victim is rising above 800.
That's awful.
When World Vision officials from Dogliaka have managed to survive in the city of Palu, where the officials sheltered in the tiled tent that was built in their office yards, on their journey they had passed through various areas of the square, said Father Doseba.
"They tell me that they've seen many houses that are destroyed," she said.
That's so awful.
Even when relief groups begin to move slowly to start disaster-reduction activities, some of them complain that there is an intrusion of foreign volunteers with expertise, who are to go to the Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, the provision of supplies and energy from outside the country can only begin if the affected areas have been officially identified as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the time the government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we can receive international help, but there is no such status."
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in the Palu, the friends and family of the lost victims still hope that the people they love will be part of the miracle that will fix the natural disaster story.
On the Sabbath, a boy was brought out from under a glass.
On Sunday, the rescuer pulled out a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian national paragliding team coach, has been a coach for two missing paragliding athletes, who managed to follow the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Father Mandage, are his disciples.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how after news of the Roa-Roa Hotel that was broken down in the paragliding community, with despair he sent a message WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who also participated in the celebration on the beach.
However, all the messages, there's only one sign of gray, instead of a two-color blue.
"I think it means the unsent message," he said.

The West Kanye: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced a change of name over Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The first thing that was formally known as Kanye West."
West, age 41, already has Ye's name for some time and uses it as its eighth album title, released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to write his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to perform at the show, which was cancelled because of "emotional reasons," said the show creator.
As a abbreviation for his current professional name, formerly West said that for him that word had religious significance.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You,' West said at the beginning of this year, discussing the album title with the publisher of Big Boy Radio.
"So I am you, I am us, that name is us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only to become Ye-- as a mirror of our kindness, our bad, our confusion, all.
It's more like our real self-scanning album."
He's one of a number of rappers that changed their names.
Sean Combs in various ways has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year it announced its preference for Love and Brother Love.
Former collaborator West, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of connection and large letters.
President of Mexico, AMLO, I swear not to use the military in the face of civil society
The President chosen Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had sworn that he would never use military power against the civilian community by warning the 50 years of the bloody retaliation against the student.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military power to press the Mexicans."
The troops launched fire on peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when the movement of left wing students sparked its roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing monthly benefits for those in college and opening more universities free of charge.
He says that unemployment and lack of opportunity for education encourage young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the A.I. deployment.
Since China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funding that will be used for research in the field, the words investors and A2 Kai-Fu Lee practice, which has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. was in complete lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: to become the number 1 in the 2030 innovation.
"Summary funding of AI research is a good start, since all other countries tend to stay away from the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
Cross-funding could double the opportunity so that the next major achievement of AI would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, the owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of the Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed the AI system that beats the best American Othello player, and after that he became an executive at Microsoft Research and Google president of China branch.
Lee recognized the U.S. government technology competition as a Robotic Challenge for the Final Defense Research Project and asked when his next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win the government's prize, says Lee.
"It's not China taking over academics; it's a company," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring high-tech professionals from the university for research in the past few years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. to support a round of AI efforts.
"I think the green card can be offered automatically for the PHD holder in the AI field," he said.
China's National Council issued its next Generation Design Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions the same way as the Nature Science Foundation and other government organizations that distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic tasks is lower in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed a Joint Building Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industrial partners and academics, and the White House authorities announced the formation of the Selection Committee for Engineering.
And in this month, DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, recently DARPA invested more than $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that called for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Economic Intelligence did not see any further action for months.
Macedonian citizens do a vote in order to change the name of the country
The Macedonians made a vote on Sundays to decide that the name of the country should be changed to "the North Macedonian Republic," an action that would resolve conflicts for a decade with Greece that had challenged its membership offer to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greek, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the view that the name of the northern neighboring country represents the confession of ownership of its territory and has prohibited joining the country with NATO and the European Union.
Both governments reached the agreement in June on the basis of the new name submitted, but nationalist opposition argued that change would damage the identity of most of Slavia's ethnic population Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't give his voice to the general election and a boycott campaign has raised doubts if the election results could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the votes required for the legitimate election results.
The question is: "Do you agree to NATO membership and EU by accepting any agreement with Greece?"
Supporter of name changes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price worth paying to get permission to enter the body like the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of Yugoslavia's destruction.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the younger generation of Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Even if not legally bound, quite a number of members of parliament say they will obey the result of voting in order to make decisions.
Name changes require two-by-three voice access in parliament.
The state election committee says there's not yet a violation report until 1:00 p.m.
However, it turned out that the result of the vote was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters gave their voice mail.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a picker in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice mail for the general election in Macedonia in order to change the name of the country that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, a 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov has already prepared a small stage and pulled seats in front of the tents that those who are going to boycott that vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join honorably, not through the waiter door," said Kavarkov.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more needed investment for Macedonia, which had an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe most people will approve it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after delivering his voice mail.
He said "yes" would be "confirming our future."
A survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday states that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the polling of the voice - less than the required number.
Another poll, hosted by Telma Macedonian TV station, found 57 percent of respondents planning to come and give their voice on Sundays.
Of them, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
To be successful, it takes 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure in voting would represent a rejection of the first policy against the pro-Barat government since taking over in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City explored all of Brighton's defenses to score goals.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling was forced into Brighton's defense on Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the victory look very easy on his score in the minutes to 65.
Argentine attackers received an opin in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three men defending Brighton, before he got into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green-faced people.
He turned past one defender before running ahead of some other men at the end of the Brighton gulf.
Then he operated on his left, to Sterling.
The British forwarder used his first kick from the gawag's direction to blow the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's kiper, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the gagang.
"Aguero was struggling with some problems on his feet," said the city manager Pep Guardiola to the reporter.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
Sure enough, the young Bethelites have befriended Jacob.
We're glad he scored a goal at that time."
But Sterling gave Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League fight.
It happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a ball, far in the Brighton region on that game.
He operated the ball with a far, dazzling kick through the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little dripping ball before leading Sterling to the farthest post.

Scherzer wants to match spoiler versus Rockies
With Nationals eliminated from the playoff game, there's no reason to force another match.
But Scherzer who is too competitive hopes to be able to excel Colorado Rockies at the game on Sunday, but only if there's still playoff involvement for Rockies, which is superior in one match over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies at most have found no place after winning in the wild-card match against Nationals with score 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division title.
"Although we play without winning, at least we can find out the atmosphere in Denver with a crowd of audiences and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in a match like that?"
The Nationals have not announced the opening match for Sunday, but it is reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer fight.
Scherzer, who will start a 34-time strike, holds a training session on Thursday and starts a Sunday game that is usually used to rest.
The right-hand Pitcher Washington is a 18-7 score with an average run (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strike-out in 220 2/3 inning this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The President himself refers to a situation in which the Court's high-ranking judge, Brett Kavanaugh, spoke of the importance of the republican public's people's voice in the middle of the election.
"All the efforts we've done are at stake in November.
Five weeks before it was held the most important election in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I don't really run that's why I fight everywhere for extraordinary candidates," he said.
Trump goes on, "You see there's a group of radical democracy that's very, very horrifying, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you saw the crime, their vileness.
They do not care who they hurt.
Democracy, he says, is on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrath and evil and vile and untrustworthy."
He referred to the Senate of Diana Feinstein, a member of the Senate’s Court Committee, in which he mentioned his name, which was accompanied by a hard search by his listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, I'm waiting-- that's a very bad body language-- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labor Camp Party is no longer a public service site.
Now be an intolerance to anyone who's raising his mind.
When Momentum's activist at the local party I gave a voice to mock me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I was in the last order of the Parliamentary Member, who was told that our presence was not expected because we expressed our views.
My colleague at the parliament, Joan Ryan got a similar treatment because he defended anti-Semitism strongly.
In my case, it criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, the irony issue that Jeremy Corbyn opposed to earlier leaders.
Notification for the meeting of the workers of the East Nottingham on Friday states that "we want to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I have been a member of the local Labour Parliament, a meeting of the General Committee on that very Friday night.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about "better, more friendly" politics is not long forgotten, if, indeed, it has ever begun.
Differences of opinion in the labor party become clearer are not tolerated and each opinion is judged by the party authority.
It began as soon as Jeremy became a leader, as I thought I would be able to share the same political viewpoint, to start expecting me to turn around and accept the position that I would never want to receive - either in national security or in the single European Union market.
Whenever I speak openly--and no matter what I say--then after that there will be a search in social media that calls for the cancellation of the show, delving the central politics, telling me I shouldn't be at the Labour Party.
And it wasn't just me who had it.
Of course, I know that I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire professionalism and the limitations of my colleague who has faced sexual harassment or racism every day but never shunned.
One of the most disappointing aspects of today's political era is how much abuse has been considered natural.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should help develop culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer on a broader church and with every motion "unbelievable" or altering the selection of party rules becomes more limited.
I got a lot of advice for two years ago that moved me to keep my head down, not too much voice, and then I'll say, "OK."
But I fell into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by the construction of Thatcher government, which resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsed, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who so desperately need it as local counselors and ministers in government.
I had never hidden my political actions, including in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East would question my policy position and things that I do not agree with today's leadership.
For those who encourage a motion on Friday, what I can say is when the country moves fast towards the division of sovereignty (Brexit), it will endanger our state business and public service, I don't want to waste time and energy for loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, as a member of the Labour Party or not.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr climb to top position
The last two experiments may have been a bit of a fraud, but no doubt Ayr deserved to win the Tennent's Premiership game today.
Now they're in the top order, the only side that's unbeatable from ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, and the ability to achieve the best opportunities, which make the host team and coach Peter Murchie have the right to feel happy.
"So far we've been testing our game, and we're still unbeatable so we feel happy," she said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The appreciation for Ayr, they're better off taking a chance than we do."
The experiment Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in front, but the yellow card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given at the game by Warriors, gave the opportunity for Melrose to print numbers and Jason Baggot to rob an unconverted experiment.
Clima loosened Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of time, he scored a goal and then did a single experiment to make Ayr's score 17-5 at rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and the experiment of Patrick Anderson, revised by Baggot, reduced the opportunity to five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruaridh Knott had a serious wound, held out, and since the start of the fight, Ayr went faster than the Stafford McDowall experiment, modified by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson later hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a spare player pay with an unaltered Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of high pressure.
Mr. Home has come back to play, but at the time of the Hutchinson Strean getting a yellow card because of pasting Climo without a ball, from the penal line, MacPherson arrives behind Ayr's advanced wounded.
Climo was replaced, as is the case again, almost from the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe made a gawk kick and disrupted the fifth effort of Gregor Henry's operator.
Still Game Star looks ready for his new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Kieran star appears ready to move to the service industry after earlier it was known that she was renamed as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis performance at BBC's popular show, which is hosted and also starred with an old comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The couple had announced that the nine series coming was the last episode, and Kiernan appeared to be planning to drive the broadcast directly after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun narrative suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in "the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific.
Sailors perform patrols at La Paz’s large military base.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Navy Camp from Titicaca to Amazon is powered by a motorcycle: "The sea is our legal right.
To get back up is a duty."
Passing through Bolivia’s land, the memories of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a 19th - century bloody conflict are still clear - as the desire to rekindle the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, since Bolivia is waiting for the court ruling on October 1 after the five - year match.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope of outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will be watching the ICJ trial across the country, hope that the court in Den Haag will support Bolivia’s claim that - after decades of insignificant negotiations -Chile is obliged to negotiate the guarantee of Bolivia’s sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, president of Bolivia's
"We've been very close to the return of the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court cannot decide Bolivia's wishes - and that would only change a little if it were possible.
The Dutch-based U.N. bodies have no power to hand over Chile's territory, and it's already decided that it won't decide the outcome of the negotiations.
That the ICJ's statement comes only six months after the final argument that has been heard, which indicates that the case is "uncomplex," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And still a long way from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the past four years, it may be that there is a decline.
"The access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he says.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the good ictified of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at a certain point will remain in contact, but it will be very difficult to keep up with after this.
Both countries have not changed the Ambassador since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, deputy to the Bolivian government in Den Haag, quickly rejected the decision.
Monday will give Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of dispute with mutual advantage," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales-also one of the most famous Latin American presidents-use the marine issue as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never relinquish its right to have access to the Pacific Sea," she added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see if we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons are not going to happen unless they can trust the U.S.
Foreign Minister North Korea Ri Yong Ho said his country would never remove nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the UN General Congregation.
He mentioned the United States to carry out a deal that was made at the meeting in Singapore between competing leaders.
The comment appeared when the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was almost starting a nuclear diplomacy that had been killed for more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri said just a "sweet dream" that continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the declaration of the Korean War resolution would make North Korea give up.
Washington was vigilant to agree to that declaration without any Pyongyang making efforts to demarcate the armed forces first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to hold a second meeting.
But there is a doubt that Pyongyang's full commitment to the confession of the weapons warehouse that the country has become the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris fashion show shows a lot of the latest collection of head closes to the main road near you
If you want to increase the collection of hats or really want to protect yourself from sunlight don't find anything else.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers released a series of big-sized cap caps for their SS19 collection on the fashion show stage with stunning style held in Paris Fashion Week.
The truly impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer, and these designers have been watching the creation that blinds the stage of the sport.
The highlight of Valentino is the cream-colored hat on which it is adorned with the broad edges of the fur basin that covers the head of the model.
A large size accessory includes a pair of diamonds, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange-and-right mask group approaching Halloween.
A lot of colored masks whose lips have been sewn up and look like Hannibal Lecter compared to high couture.
A creation that resembles snorkel and glass, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep looking at that wide mode collection -- then you're being flattered.
Mode observers estimate that the big hat collection will be directed to the main road near you.
Big-sized hats become very fast trains in La Bomba, straw hats with a width of two feet visible were worn all including Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The worship of the label behind a hat that is very impractical of social media makes a great creation on the beach spots of the huge straw almost equal to the swimwear - used with a cellular model.
The bag of ravines that were burned, cut with rabies on the edge with white straps, is a remarkable thing from the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity designer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see the big hat and beach bag arrive on the main road for the next summer--because the designer has made a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for such a large accessory'
John Edward: Language skills are important to the global population
Scotland's private school keeps track of academic excellence, and it's continued in 2018 with an extraordinary test result, which is being strengthened by each student and collective success in sports, art, music and hard work.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish School Council (SCIS) are working hard to provide the best services for students and parents.
The school is designed to prepare its students for higher and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education that can design and implement the curriculum as expected, we see modern languages continue to be the subjects of popular choice and want in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in the language he understands, you'll get into his head.
If you speak to him in his language then you will enter his heart."
It's a strong reminder that we can't just rely on the English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent test this year, we can see that language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation in the school.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn the foreign language get the A Plus.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools that show that 72 percent of students get A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them learn German, 69 percent of them learn French and 63 percent learn Spanish also get A.
This indicates that the school’s independent support of the foreign language was an important skill that children and teenagers would certainly need in time to come.
At this time, language, as an eye choice, is held in the same standards as the STEM study (saints, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Ministry of Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for some reasons workers had to keep fighting to fill the openings, 17 percent why there was a lack of English skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their careers in time to come.
As the number of opportunities for work in the field of speaking increased, this skill becomes very important in the world’s response.
Whatever a person's career choices, if they've learned the second language, in the future they'll have real benefits because of having this kind of lifelong skills.
It is possible to communicate directly with citizens of a foreign country who will automatically make a superior multi-speaker in competition.
According to the opinion of YouGov in over 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to engage in conversation and French as the only language spoken in two digits, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning for children now is important for this moment.
Having multilingual skills, especially the language of countries with a growing economy, will divide children with a better opportunity to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the most important language in England for the next few years, 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected at school, with the teaching staff who are experts in this field.
Scotland's independent school is designed to provide the learning environment that will prepare the children and divide them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be ruled out that today, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
The independent school will continue to offer options, conveniences, and this excellence to Scotland’s teenagers.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish School Building Board
LeBron will have a debut for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting for fans to see LeBron James take over his debut for Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening for the Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it hasn't been determined how many minutes he'll be playing.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote tweet that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After early this week's training, James was asked about his plan for the six games for Lakers.
"On my career stage right now, I don't have to do the season games to prepare," he said.
Trump Public Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a public campaign meeting tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first public meeting of Trump of five public meetings scheduled for next week, including a stop in some pleasant places covering Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was stated that the vote was postponed so that he could choose to fill the Supreme Court, Trump intended to build his support for the upcoming joint public election because the Republican Party would risk losing control of Congress if the vote was taken on November.
What time is Trump's public meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia scheduled for 7:00 a.m. and tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's public meeting in West Virginia online via direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's trial for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who is becoming more tense after the charges of unexplained sexual activity and the Senate's assessment of the vote will be delayed until a week while the FBI investigates them.
But the main purpose of this general agenda meeting is to help the Republic party get some momentum in facing the November general election.
Therefore, in the campaign President Trump mentioned that five public meetings this week are intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters because the Republican party is trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the DPR," Reuters said.
"Controll Congress is very important to his agenda so the president will probably travel to the countries during our busy campaign season," the Trump campaign speaker who refused to mention his name conveying to Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, a public meeting tonight expected to be able to provide supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the lynchon from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be a second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state that he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia Senate candidate from the left-wing Republican Party in the polls.
"Not a good sign for Morrisey so the president should come as an effort to raise his opinion gap," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team of bravery champions hold their hope in face of the single game Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome session is probably required in this Ryder Cup.
The swing of the momentum band is a concept of sport that is the result of a fully trusted discovery by players, and nothing is greater than in this competition.
Where do they think the moment is right now?
"Before, they're up six points and now four, so I think we're considering it as a little moment," said Jordan Spieth as he passed that day.
Europe certainly has the advantage of top four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had a little bit of a moment and they had a lot of things that could become a spirit, no exception to the formations of Spieth and Justin Thomas that played together all day and each of them boasts three out of four points.
Spieth has played deadlyly from the tea area to the green area and led with a twist.
The screams of the parachute were getting harder when his turn came, doing the key posting punch to make a series game when he and Thomas lost two against two.
Putting hits of him who won them on the 15th that was greeted with similar screams, screams that told you that he sure America didn't lose.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes needing to be marked.
The only player with points more than Spieth and Thomas for two days ago was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unbreakable story from Ryder Cup.
The unique but interesting couple from Europe are four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who don't do bogey punch on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoid bogey on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and backsine on Friday mornings.
The run, and how their energy seems to flow well to either of this luxuriant crowd that convinces them that they are the players to be defeated on Sundays, and there are no players more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari who will lock up Europe's potential for victory at sunset on the Le Golf National.
It's better if at the same time they're both placed in a different hole.
Still, it is too early to speak of European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson slowed down the work of Sergio Garcia, a fourball hero in the morning, when he was installed with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front of the nine like digging holes that will never be raised by the Spanish and Swedish golfers.
Even though, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are a good show to be seen closer because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategy can change at once.
So far, Europe plays better as a team and leads far enough to the final day, but the ansomes also show that the U.S. team has balls to compete even though doubted by some parties, especially in the United States.
Upper Europe 10-6 on the last day Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the final day Ryder Cup after the rise of fourballs and foursomes Saturdays with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Two inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to record their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
The Thomas Bjorn European team, who wanted to maintain an unattainable trofi in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. team that was mistargeted in fourball morning, made this serial result to be 3-1.
The United States has given more resistance in forsome, winning two matches, but they cannot reduce deficits.
The Jim Furyk team needs eight points out of 12 single game Sunday to hold the trofi.
Fleetwood is the first European debut to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after the end of the sensational week, are only a second couple who won four points of their four openings in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they became very solid to defeat the slender Woods and the American debut Bryson Dechambbeau with a stronger 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two matches on Saturdays, once brilliantly performing but has lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rest at the morning fourball, then go back to pair with Henrik Stenson in the ansome and lose 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka -- world rankings one and three.
Europe did not reach itself even though the day was pleasant and winding in the west of Paris.
The main winner of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas three times set the US standard with two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 win that was exciting over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball and then back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in antsome after losing two first holes.
Only twice has happened in the history of Ryder Cup where a team back from the fourth point deficit entered the single game, although as the champion survives the Furyk team only needs serial points to maintain the trofi.
But after being the best of the second for two days, Sunday's back attacks seemed to go beyond them.
North Korea says 'unprobably' will disarm sideways without any trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations of the continuing sanctions against the United States of America and it would not be possible for the country to wipe out its nuclear weapons on a single side in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Council of the world that North Korea had taken "significant steps to show good intentions" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, decommissioning the location of nuclear testing, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"No, we didn't see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we can't afford to disarm our own weapons first on a one-by-one basis."
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "supply" approach to the investigation where North Korea would be punished for taking steps gradually, the statement signified that they did not completely reject as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit meeting between the president of the United States and the new North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, at that time, Kim promised to "conclude the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has officially wanted the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused the call to extend heavy international sanctions to North Korea.
"The United States insists on "premises first" and increases pressure by the semi-sanctions to reach their goal in force, and even rejects "declaration of the end of the war," says Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us scold our knees is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is the constant sanction that will increase our disbelief."
Ri didn't mention a plan for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, escorted the U.S. leader of the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister also endorsed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the problem-makers in this research are South Korea and not the United States, the collapse of the Korean side won't reach this kind of dead end."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the UN General Congregation that targeting North Korea rockets on United States land was a thing that could not be avoided after the "Lord President Devil" Trump called Kim "man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN meeting, a year ago Trump threatened to "break up" North Korea in total, he praised Kim for her courage and took steps to disarm, but the huge work still had to be done and sanctions had to be done until North Korea did a breakthrough.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - no problem," he said.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the Foreign Minister of the United States, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanction of the Security Council must be continued with firmness and must not fail until we know that full, final and verified inconsistencies."
Security Council with a round voice increased sanction for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop nuclear program and Pyongyang ballistic missile.
Pompeo met Ri in the wake of the UN General Council and then said that he was going to visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there's been real progress, just North Korea in the count of the stormy hours that he made "supply like gangsters."
North Korea has promised in a meeting with Moon this month to destroy missile locations and also nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate steps."
He stated that Kim told him to do a "appropriate guess" with his wish was a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalization of relationships with Washington.
High School Harvard took a course on enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year made all S1 students sleep more, in an effort to fight macho culture in learning that is developing through the 'man of ghosts' of caffeine.
An academic discovered that students at the university number one world often don't know anything if they're talking about the very basic thing about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep-related medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course, which he believed was the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a lecture on the effects of sleepless studies.
'In the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why did I just be told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping - which shocked me,' she told The Telegraph.
The course was first launched this year, explaining to students the essence of how good sleeping habits help academic and athletics and improve their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a student who was very short of sleep all week.
The course for an hour involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there are images of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation about the influence of caffeine and light, and how athletic results are influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of routine sleep time.
On the other hand, the participants were told how long sleep shortages could increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A college map, with interactive icons, then moves the participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know - as you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health,'
A culture of pride with the 'sheep' still exists, as it were, plus that modern technology and pressure that continues to increase in students that means lack of sleep is a problem that continues to grow.
To ensure that you sleep enough, with good quality, must be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, the burden - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain activates the mode of hunger, triggers the constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old resident in California who studied chemistry and physical biology that helped Professor Czeisler design the course, took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize the course for the entire college.
The next step, he hoped that the entire university student would be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider regulating the alarm during sleep, also awakening alarms, and aware of the effects of the ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can move your circular rhythm out of the course so as to cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga mentally lowers Gerrard's army
Again, the Rangers felt the sadness of the heart during the Dolly Menga attack to deliver the Steven Gerrard team that was buried in a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibox team tried to record their first victory on their way, since their 4-1 victory in February at St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team had just given a second defeat for Gerrard in 18 games as manager, causing his team to leave eight points left by the leader of the class leader Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Attacking seven minutes before the first round is over and unreasonable Rangers don't seem to balance.
While Rangers are now down to the sixth position, Livingston rises to the third position, only left a different goal of Hibernian.
And there could be further problems in Rangers' mautum after Calum Spence's line guard had to be treated for head injuries after an object thrown out of the distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on the Ayr-fly team to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the contrary, Holt went with the same 11 Livi who took a point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with the costumes that haunted their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the possession of the ball, but Livingston uses the ball they own better.
They should've recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bait Meng was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's rag, but it attracted that big opportunity too wide.
A free shot of Jacobs' Maghan, a deep one, met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only stab wide in the back position.
Rangers take control but there seems to be more hope than confidence about their game at the third end.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he was supposed to get a penalty when he and Steven Lawless crashed on a quarter-hour mark but listened to Steven Thomson refusing to speak to the Colombians.
Rangers only managed to make two jumps in the first round but former Ibriox guard, Liam Kelly, hardly ever bother with Lassana Coulibaly's headaches and easy-to-relief Ovie Ejaria's attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposed to the path of the match, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' deep dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball at Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for the simple end.
Gerrard acted at rest by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and that replacement hardly affected directly when the wingman placed a ball on Morelos but Kelly played impressively quickly out of the line to stammer.
But Livingston keeps forcing the farm team to play the exact game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett wiped out all the long balls.
The Holt team was supposed to expand their excellence at the end but McGregor stood up well to throw Jacobs away before Lithgow across the corner.
Ranger replacement, Glenn Middleton, claiming penalty again when he disagreed with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face.
Almanac: Guest Geiger Breaker
And now from our Sunday Morning Almanac page: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and the MASH will be overstaying... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed methods to detect and measure radioactivity, which was a discovery that finally made the device called Geiger Breaker.
Being a science-based tool since then, Geiger's crackdown has also been the root of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," identified the cowboy scientists who seemed less convinced of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's Breaker, used to find a radioactive mineral location, like uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of the atom released by radioactivity in the mineral."
Evans: "Tell me, it's going to happen now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But that discovery kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune systems to "know" evil cells
New cancer vaccines teach immune systems to 'know' evil cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches an immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from patients, converting them to laboratory.
They can then recognize common proteins in many cancers and then inject them again.
An experiment vaccine shows a promising outcome to patients with various types of cancer.
A woman was treated with that vaccine, which taught an immune system to recognize evil cells, and her ovary cancer was lost for over 18 months.
This method involves the patient's immune cell extraction process, turning it into a laboratory so that they can "know" the protein that is generally present in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cell back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the United States National Cancer Agency in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "It's true that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "grows some kind of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colorectals, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
The same approach as the patient's immune cell collection and "teaching" to them how to target cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.
The Kanye West started Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing MAGA Top, after its SNL appearance.
Not Walking Well
Kanye West was horrified at the studio during Saturday Night Live after playing a mess where he commended the President of the United States Donald Trump and said he would run himself in 2020.
After bringing in the third song that night, called Ghost Town where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic party and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL starts a show with a badge that Matt Damon's star Hollywood star is laughing at Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the claim of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcasted, the West's cactus footage is posted to social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock's trying to make fun of West with that bait.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind stage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They snuggled me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't come out with that hat.'
They hit me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "You want to see a drowning place?" says that he's going to wear Superman's clothing, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do. Do you want the world to advance?
Try to love."
The comment was made on at least two occasions from the audiences and the SNL viewers looking ashamed, Variety reported, with one person saying, "A whole studio is closed."
West was brought in at last moments as a substitute for Ariana Grande, a former rapist boyfriend Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confuses many people with I Love it, dressed like the Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservation group, Candace Turner who wrote tweet: "For one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU HAVE BEEN RAKED."
But the bearer of Karen Hunter's event wrote tweet that West is just "being himself and it's really very good."
"But I don't choose to give anyone a gift (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) that I believe in stalking and extorting ideologies that are dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So do we," more.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "a creature who is officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's trail, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
As a rapist, Snoop Dogg gets the name Snoop Lion and of course the legend of Prince music, turning his name into a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Attempts to kill an inmate at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The trader was expected to be present in front of the Belfast Court of Justice on Monday.
This charge will be examined by the Attorney General.
Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticizes poisonous masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for swinging swords in his role as Jon Snow in the mid-century fantasy series full of violence from HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, with stereotypes of macho heroes, said that the role on the screen is often made young boys feel that they must be strong to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he was convinced that he was wrong and questioned how to handle a bad masculine problem in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who just married his opponent at Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, claimed he felt 'strong enough' to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, quite powerful, right now-- where is our fault in this masculinity?' he said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, related to the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the appearance of bad masculineness with its very masculine characters.
He goes on to say: 'Where is the character from birth, and what is taught?
What does it teach on TV, and on the street, which makes boys feel that they should have this particular side to be men?
I think it's really one of the big questions of this time-- how do we change it?
Because clearly there's something wrong with the young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in prepelt or sequele Game of Thrones at the time this series would end in the summer of coming, saying that he had been 'selected with the field of war and horses'.
Since November Kit will rescind True West from Sam Shepard, which is a story about the film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so give me the future family, and from here my life begins' her speech.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in this Emmy award-winning series.
This couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Tiokok reports 14% of the new cases
China has announced 14% of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are infected in this country, says health officer.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of Tiokok as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, the health officials of Tiokkok said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the T.L.B.L.T. community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people was called more and more important.
Because of the conservative value of this country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many diseases come from inappropriate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of the effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters objected that the staff had leaked the senator's GOP data, spread 'a dangerous lie' and 'complementary theory'
Parliamentary Maxine Waters on Saturday objected that one of its staff members had sent personal information to the pages of Wikipedia Members of Parliament.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserts that the claim was moved by experts and websites "ultra-right wind".
"The lie, the lie, and many more of the disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the information released includes the home address and phone number of the U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by unknown people in Capitol Hill during the Senate panel of the Senate on the charges of unsolicited sexual abuse of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
This bocoran appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the shipment is connected to the Waters office and revealing information from one of the Waters staff members, Hill reported.
"This claim isn't entirely wrong and it's a total lie," continues Waters.
"My staff members - who are identity, personal information, and their safety are threatened by the accusations of deception and error - are completely irresponsible of this information leak.
This is not a false accusation.
Waters quickly attract criticism online, including the former Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This mess means anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be a member of Congress.
Nothing makes a person feel guilty if he does not do so.
They must not stray.
They can't question the motive of the coroner.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday congregation.
Omar Navarro, the candidate of the Republic party who was trying to move Waters on the part-time election, also conveys his thinking on Twitter.
"Just if it's true," it says on Twitter.
In his statement, Water says his office has warned "right authority and the law enforcement entity about this wrong charge.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be revealed," and further, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to one and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strings Again - bad spy parody Rowan Atkinson
Now looking for Brexit significance in every new film with an old English perspective has become a tradition and it seems to be happening for the re-emergence of the Johnny English paráralodi parádios - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the syndicate sarcasm be about how clearly we're being a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English, whose eyes were soaked, had a rubber eye, and his lack of competence had renewed his license to mess up everything for the second time - his name gave more guidance than anything that he was a vast comical creation designed for the foreign - English - speaking cinema area.
Of course, he's a crazy secret agent who, apart from his strange guess, has a little clouseau character, a sort of character Mr. Bean and a traveler's cecumite that gives a little note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
In fact, he was based on a visitor and an international mysterious man who had been playing Atkinson on the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving the mess behind.
There's one or two sweet moments on this latest JE trip.
I like it when Johnny English approached a helicopter with mid-century zirths and slenders of the rotor straps quickly attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy is shown, but his humor is less powerful and too strange, especially when branding a "serious" film like 007 and Mission It's impossible to believe in inserting a comedy as a material.
It feels like it's meant for children rather than adults, and for me it's a strange Johnny English that is not innovative and focused on Atkinson film jokes in Bean's personality.
A prize that's been warming up for years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, uncovering the identity of all British agents in the field, to disappoint a busy agent -- unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the proud and hostile prime minister, who has destroyed his total popularity politically: Emma Thompson played very well with almost-Teresa-May characters but not much of the script.
The smart counseler gives information that because every active spy has been crushed, he has to bring someone out of retirement time.
And that means Johnny English's own faggot, now employed as head of school in some fancy buildings, but giving a secret lesson on how to do the undercover operation: there's some nice jokes here, when English offers spy academy like School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency briefings and rejoined with an old friend who had been suffering from Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, instigating a submarine commander, the role of a high-class woman who sucks where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit out of her mind.
So Batman and Robin made a mistake on Your Majesty's Secret Agent back in action, met a beautiful mystery woman Ophelia Bulletova that Olga Kurylenko had.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is worriedly falling into the influence of a millionaire charismatic technology that claims to be able to solve the problem of English computers: evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their silly adventures: disguised as a waiter, they burned the fast French saji; they made a mess by sneaking over the luxury ship of Volta; and English triggered anarchy when he tried to use the headset Virtual Reality to get used to the inside of the Volta house.
All the stops must have been pulled for the last sequence, but with the hospitality and riots like that, there's a little TV channel of kids that's all about it.
That's pretty moderate.
And like any other Johnny English film, I can't think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
The workers objected to planning for the British to be able to work four days a week but paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Workers ’ Union considered radical plans that wanted the British to work four days a week - but paid five days.
It is reported that the owners of the company continue to reappraise by means of a revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) for the workers by giving them additional holidays.
He'll let the employees enjoy the weekend of three days - but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that this idea will be 'pass' with the party's economic agenda and plans push the country to support the workers.
The fourth day of the week has been approved by British Congress of Dagang as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A source, the senior of the Labor Union, told The Sunday Times: 'The expectation of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This is not going to happen overnight, but four days of work a week is an aspiration that matches the party approach in order to re-evaluate the economy that supports workers and the party's industrial strategies as a whole.'
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party has promised four days of work in a week at the 2017 general election campaign.
However, these aspirations are currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party speaker said, 'On a weekly working day, it's not party policy and it's not being considered by the parties.'
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to perfect his vision for a social revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "anonymous directors" and "cattographers" in utility companies.
The plan also means that the current shareholders in the drinking water company may not be able to get the whole stock back because the government of the Manwah party can do "surrender" on the grounds of a perceived violation.
He also made sure that his plans to place workers in the board and to create Inclusive Ownership Dana would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, who would bend annual dividends to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their view.
The FBI investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh's allegations has postponed the final vote on his accession to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raised the question of whether the findings of this office could affect the senators of the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In the interview shown on Sunday, the correspondent for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Senator of the Republican Party, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find something that could change their minds.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his South Carolina partner.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I would attend trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charges appeared, and said, 'You did it?'
He's a firm, firm, firm man."
It seems, however, that Graham’s voice could not be changed.
"My mind has made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is: Brett fought him hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he calls his name can't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I didn't see any new changes."
What does the Global Citizen Festival mean, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that showcases the star rails that are very impressive, and the mission that is also effective; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be witnessing tens of thousands of people flocking to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the actions of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the purpose of this event which actually means ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (except you want to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in reaching its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a right way to invite people to do something, or just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, prompting them to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped in trigger world leaders to announce a commitment and policy that is equal to more than $37 billion that would affect more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group had gathered 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of them had been delegated or funded.
This group estimates that the security fund so far has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
A number of major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership composed of investors and perpetrators committed to "help the children grow to their maximum potential," promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the lack of nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, supporters, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice about this lack of nutrition as a history record," Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a direct concert in London in April 2018.
This group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to increase nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions on the General Questions on their websites that asked "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global scientist answers: "This will be a long and difficult road--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just like the civil rights movement and the great anti-apartheids that exist before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the stars that perform this year's show in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "block" to stop Russia's energy exports - State Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could ask for help from the Navy to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as stated by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly believes that Russia’s involvement in Syria - in particular, where it operates on a legitimate government invitation - is a turning point for exploring a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be an energy maker, just like they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure the open seaway, and, if necessary, to do a blockade, to make sure that their energy can't get into the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the events held by the Alliance of Consumer Energy, a nirlaba group that called himself an "energy customer's voice" in the U.S.
He compared the approach Washington made in a deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
"Economic choices in Iran and Russia are less, using and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with the economy that depends on fossil fuel.
This statement appeared when Trump's government representative was doing a mission in order to increase their natural gas exports to Europe, instead of Russia, a much cheaper choice for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including President AS Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull away from the North Stream 2 "undeserved" oil pipeline project, which Trump said, made Berlin the "holder" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 billion dollar oil mill project, designed to double the capacity of oil mills up to 110 billion cubic feet of oil, is purely an economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's hard fight against this project is merely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy cannot be made to exert pressure and that customers must be able to choose their own installers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexandr Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This attitude has attracted the reaction of Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in the energy policy of the European Union and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I'll face big problems if the third country mixes up our energy supplies," says Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "see the situation" when running himself as President in 2020, said Senator Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he would "watch the situation" while running for president after a part-time election.
While campaigning at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren emphasized that he would consider running himself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, including putting women in the top position," as they say to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will reflect the situation when running as president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning in the city hall, saying that he "takes this area in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren was blanc in delivering his criticism of Trump and the Supreme Court of Great Britain Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Surely we need an FBI investigation before we make a vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that most of Warren’s constituents did not want him running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that it would be better if the senator didn't run himself, according to Suffolk's opinion at the University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent that supports the caller.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run himself, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running himself and 48 percent against him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed regarding the possibility of running for 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd decide officially in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quoted PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my son experienced, what he was going to experience when he returned, I was able to connect with other families who also felt the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers suffered," he said in front of those in attendance at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and told him about his son and other war veterans, "they returned a little different, they went back harder, they went back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, their fellow soldiers and their pilots and every other military member to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, plus with reports of domestic violence and possession of drunk weapons, according to And Bennett, the spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support the challenge of the law against the new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims who escape from gangs or domestic violence.
The representative of 18 states and this district filed friends-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seekers in challenging the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of Grace v. In the session filed by American Civil Liberties Union in August with regard to federal policy has not yet been revealed.
He said his partner "and his son was a member of the gang," had insulted him, but the U.S. officials refused his asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors in favor of Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylummakers for the U.S., as countries that face major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The U.S.'s new policy goes backwards with the 2014 immigration border council's decision that allows dark immigrants to escape domestic violence to present asylum.
Attorney General District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "improvements the laws of the state, federal, and international that have been in existence for several decades."
"Federal law requires that all claims should be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances related to the claim, and such prohibitions as they violate the principle," the friend-of-the short brief said.
Further prosecutors give a brief opinion that the policy that refuses the entry of immigrants is detrimental to the U.S. economy, says that they are likely to be entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered the immigration judge to stop giving relief to victims who escaped from domestic violence and gang cruelty.
"They are available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fears caused by race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion," Sessions said in the announcement of this policy on June 11.
It's not meant to relieve all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
It's a very sad rescue effort on the tree because the victim doubles in running with time to find the survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very scary," says Kusuma Risa, a 35-year-old mother, calming her baby man who's in the refugee center in the ruined town of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance comes with a body.
The clean water is very rare."
People look back to their destroyed homes, take the underwater stuff, try to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and cared for in the hospital, damage caused by a 7.5 - powerful earthquake, which was a mess.
Some of them were injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from fractures of the back and shoulder bones, lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the room because of a strong earthquake.
Her tears flowed when she told back her feelings when the earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where she stayed with her wife and daughter.
"I couldn't save myself.
I think I'm stuck in the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, then shut up.
I don’t know what she is and my daughter is.
Hope they're safe."
Ambassador US accused Tiokkok of 'intimacy' by 'propaganda commercial'
A week after the official Tiokok newspaper contains four-page advertisements on an U.S. newspaper that mentions the U.S.-Tiogkok back-trade benefit, the US ambassador to Tiokok accuses Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
President AS Donald Trump on Wednesday, who then referred to the Chinese daily salary supplement in Des Moines Register - the most prominent newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing Tiokuk of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Congress election on November 6, an accusation disputed by Tiokok.
Trump's claim that Beijing's attempt to interfere in U.S. elections, marking what the U.S. official said to Reuters, is a new phase in the expansion of the campaign that Washington did to push Tiokok.
Although it's a common thing for foreign governments to put advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now trapped in ever-increasing trade wars, which makes them raise the import tariff levels for each other.
The T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T.
Terry Branstad, the great U.S. ambassador to China and former former governor of Iowa, the main exporter of farm goods to China, says Beijing has damaged workers, farmers, and perpetrators in the United States.
Tiokok, Branstad wrote an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubles the intimidation by running advertisements on our own free media."
"In spreading his propaganda, the government of China uses the tradition of free speech and press that is highly valued in America by carrying a paid commercial in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Inversely, in the street newspaper kios-kios here, in Beijing, you'll find a landslide against different voices and will not see any real scrutiny of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about the troubled Tiokok economics, considering the media under the control of the Communist Party of Tiokkok," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in China refuses to publish" his article, although he does not mention which newspaper.
Alerting Analysts, Republican Party Keep Women Out of Elections Time With Kavanaugh Disasters
Because the important people in the Republican Party who stand up and defend the leadership of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in dealing with some allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see the attack back, especially from women, on the upcoming public part-time election.
Emotions over the problem are very high, and most members of the Republican Party have been reported to have shown that they want to advance on the vote.
It can't be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the desire of the Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake in the final minutes to do the FBI investigation would be enough to dispel anger on the elector.
"Vanita won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn said it on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators shout "November is near!" when they demonstrate in the Senate hall when the Republican Party oversees Justice Committee to continue to advance in Kavanaugh's call, regardless of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Enthusiasts and motivation of democracy will come out of the list," non party political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women's voice pickers in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't give the voice."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, who described in detail sexual harassment against himself by the procurator of the Supreme Court, analysts would advise a subsequent attack if the Republican Party kept pushing him to move forward with confirmation.
"It became a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former former head of the Republican Party Committee, early last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the election of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the reserve, it's also about how the Republican Party handles this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, the director of the USA Priorities, a group that helps to choose the Democratic Party, points to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be breaking up about who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more decisive choice to the last.
A new survey of YouGov's opinion shows that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or might believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they actually believe or may believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or would actually lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said something similar about Ford.
After the encouragement from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges of Ford and one of the other wounded, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford's testimony under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that the drunk Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court's calon showed him his gratitude when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Connectors are planning to start the new Internet to face Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the World Wide Web inventor, launched a startup that was trying to match Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the legend of this technology, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, joking Berners-Lee said that the meaning behind Inrut is "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to make their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
This storage may contain a list of contacts, a list of tasks, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify that everything is available on one browser and everything at the same time.
The unique thing about storing this personal online data is that it's really up to the user who can access what kind of information.
At the company known as "personal ownership through data."
The idea of setting up Inrut, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is for the company to supply resources, processes, and skills to help get Solid available to everyone.
Now this company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted staff developers to work on the project, and the volunteer community codemakers.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world can make their own demoralization application using tools available on the Inrut web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether it would introduce or not a total change where all their business models would actually be reversed last night.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post in the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrut's mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he set up the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in network debate neutrality.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorate WW1 Victoria Cross
The only church in England that won Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter, remembered on his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military privilege.
A memorial stone is served by his two grandsons on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "intelligent symbol" stone that would reveal exactly 100 years of grandpa's performance won the award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led the battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "crossed the thick fog under fire from field and engine weapons."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with "the greatest bravery" leading the front line before rushing through the field weapons alone and paralyzing three deteases.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says his grandfather's action was "something I knew I wouldn't be able to live but it was a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put down a flower essay after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very flattered to play a part in this parade" and added "the bravery of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will give."
MMA fans worked all night to watch Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been working all night to watch the 206 Bellator that's full of trouble just to refuse to watch the main event.
San Jose's bill contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being displayed directly throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., exactly when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for each other to face, British audiences were struck when their neck turned to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciative after they are engaged until this particular day for the fight.
A Twitter fan describes the replacement to a children's cartoon film as "a disgusting joke."
"This is a government rule, that at 6 a.m. the contents are not suitable for being shown, so replaced with a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior president of marketing and Bellator communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa and pigs," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker's company said they'd fix their schedules by counting on the audience in England in the future.
"According to me, if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," said Coker.
"But right now there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when you change, a lot of text goes wrong and everything doesn't educate.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, that's a government matter.
Believe me, the next time it doesn't happen anymore.
We will reduce up to five fights of only six fights - as we used to do - and we will try to avoid overdrinking for fans, and we will succeed.
It's an unsuspecting situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low self" related to sexuality
Tom Daley's Olympic divers said he grew up with self-consciousness because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man says he doesn't realize it until he gets into middle school, that "not everybody like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs that Lauren Laverne brought, he said, he's talking about the right of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said being an old man didn't care so much about winning the Olympics.
The usual showman brought this long-running event, Kirsty Young, taking a few months' leave of illness.
As those who were excluded from Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than all the other people who grew up with him because "not the things that can be socially accepted to like men and women."
He said, "Until today, it is a feeling that is less than the others, and a feeling that is clear to me, so that I may succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let everyone down when they knew about his sexuality.
These two Olympic bronze medalists have been a famous LGBT campaigner and have been using his performance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world champion three times said he was in love with a man-made film from the United States Dustin Lance Black, which he found in 2013 - "surprising me."
Daley was married to Oscar's wife who was 20 years older than he was in the past year, and said agelessness was not a problem.
"If you had so many problems at a very young age"--he followed his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was very difficult to find someone with the same age who had the same tide.
This couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, all around 'I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there's a bigger thing than winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had already got tickets for the London 2012 Olympics - because he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I can't tell him 'you won't sit in the front row of Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he was invincible," he said.
The next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"What I know is, this is what I dreamt of my whole life--to dive in front of the crowd of people in the Olympic Games, there's no feeling better than that," she said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which had joined him in his preparation for the Olympics and still made him laugh.
Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed his role when he offered Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Pegolf America Phil Miccelson will record a record on Sunday when he played the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he had to change the role to avoid an unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played on two-year shows to record the 12th time record, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball game and the fourth group on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, the top winner five times this splits the time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on the range, hoping to fix what has made him miserable.
Never became the most straight golfer, even when he was at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man was not fit to follow a strict course in Le Golf National, which routinely gave long and harsh punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it wasn't scary enough for Miccellson, in the 9th game on Sunday, to face the open British champion who was very accurate Francesco Molinari, who had worked with the new arrival Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American fan, starting 12 single matches with four points below, starting with a hot start, then the Miccellson game will prove to be very important.
Furyk expressed his faith to this man, not because he could say a lot more.
"He really understands his role today, clapping my back and hugging me, and says he'll be ready for tomorrow's game," Furyk said.
"She's so confident.
He was Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine he played two games.
I imagine the others, but that's the way they play, and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people do."
Miccellson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
It can mark the end of his career in Ryder Cup that will never match his individual record heights.
Miccelson counted 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven series, although Furyk said his presence brought some things that could not be said on the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he said.
"I think younger players have fun with him, too, this week, which is quite fun to see.
He gave me a lot more than just to play."
Captain Europe Thomas Bjorn knows great excellence could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from the experience that someone who leads big enough to his last single game at Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his first debut at the 1997 Valderrama game, with the captain of the Séve Ballesteros team holding the top five points over America, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the thinst edge, won 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get great excellence at Valderrama; we get great excellence at Brookline, where we lose, and at Valderrama, where we win, but just," says Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching Class of 2018, won 5-3 well on Friday and yesterday with lead 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you're going into a really boring game.
Come out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a target, and that target is winning this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying, I've focused on 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side -- the world's greatest players."
It's nice to see players playing in the hard golf course, Bjorn adds: "In this case I'm never going to advance myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will advance, and this is a different thing to do.
It's really nice to be out there with a fellow if everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer will be tested completely.
That's the message you have to tell all the players, get the best out of yourself for tomorrow's game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his player to play better individually than they did as a couple, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of the last day's big game, has been part of a team that won at Brookline before it ended with defeat when Europe did "Wise in Medina."
"I remember every word," he said to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as quickly as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the moment goes one way, it's going to put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in different ways we feel, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight against Rory McIllroy in the uppermost match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players are in the uppermost order.
"I went with a bunch of these guys in order like this because I think I could close all the streets," said Bjorn about his single choice.
The new German warship was postponed
The latest German Navy ship was supposed to have begun its operation in 2014 to replace the warship of the old Cold War, but the ship would not be there until the next year because of its increased system and cost, the local media reported.
"Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship, has now been suspended until the first part of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting the military speaker.
This ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-shipment issue had disturbed the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that had been commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will come as replacements for an old Bremen-class shipguard.
This ship will be equipped with powerful cannon, a series of anti-fly missiles, and anti-fly missiles, as well as some demon technology, such as radar removal, infrared, and an agnostic key.
Other important features include a longer period of treatment - should be allowed to use the latest ship guards for two years away from the harbor.
However, the ongoing delay means that this sophisticated warship - which is said to have allowed Germany to display its power abroad - will wear out as soon as it begins to enter its period of duty, Die Zeit notes.
The bad fateful F125 ship had become an announcement last year, when the German Navy officially refused to ship the ship and returned it to the
This is the first time the Navy has returned to the ship after shipping.
Only a few well-known reasons behind the return of the ship, but the German media cited a number of "software and hardware" devices that made the warship useless if used for the battle mission.
The lack of software is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will operate by the crew of 120 sailors - only half of the labor force on the older Bremen class warship.
Also, it is known that the ship's boat is very much overpowered that will reduce its performance and limit the capacity of the Navy to add to the updates in the near future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with the 7000-ton bobot is believed to be twice as heavy as the ship with similar classes used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to a broken hard drive, the cost of production of the entire project - including training of crew - is also a problem.
It's said to rise by surprise up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the beginning €2.2 billion.
The problem that envelops these new shipguards has become very important in keeping with the recent warning of the induction of the German Navy forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defense Committee, admitted that the Navy actually "exhausted the ship with the ability to spread."
It says as the problem grows, because old ships are no longer in use but no replacement ships are provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg guards could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret bat life quietly
New research is being done on a farm on the High Plain of Scotland that aims to reveal how bats use natural gardens in their food hunts.
Hopefully this will give new light on this unique flying mammalian behavior and help guide conservation activity in the near future.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the general pipistrelle and sopran as well as long - eared chocolate bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct a cell survey using a gengam detector.
Sound experts analyzing all recordings will ensure the frequency of bat calls and species that perform what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports would be designed to create images with a scale of nature detailing their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor for the NTS, hoping this result will reveal which habitat area is most important for bats and how each species uses it.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland production and the best way to maintain the forest for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout England have dropped sharp in the past few centuries.
This is threatened by the construction and development work that affects the nest and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper hung to lure bats and chemical care of buildings, and pet cat attacks.
Actually, bats are not blind.
Yet, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They're using advanced echo location techniques to find insects precisely and barrier on their flying pathways.
The NTS, responsible for taking care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres across the country, is very concerned about bats.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nest checks, and sometimes efforts to save.
This organization has also set up the first and only natural shells in Scotland in the Thrave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
David Thompson's farm manager said the farm was the right area for bats.
"Here in Thrave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there are still many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of bat testing before doing maintenance in the property, because there is no doubt that the destruction of a breeding nest could kill up to 400 female and small bats, which would probably destroy the entire local population.
Butterflies are protected and kill, harassed, or disrupted, or destroyed by them are illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Minister for the Kekelawar Trust Conservation, has moved the public to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their fates are."
Ronaldo, who is refusing a rape claim, is preparing a lawyer to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls his rape claim "false news," and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyer would sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which issued the charges.
The attackers in Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Majorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then supposed to have paid by giving $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a direct Instagram video to 142 million followers a few hours after the claim was reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo, filmed the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," the winner Ballon d'Or five times said to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's the usual thing.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charge, which they call "a report of suspicion in the field of unacceptable privacy," according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said he would seek compensation as "replace moral damages in the amount corresponding to the weight of the infringement, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga were reported back to the player's room, where he was allegedly raped, according to a report filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayor says Ronaldo kneeled after the incident was accused and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who failed only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but it was on the basis of mutual desire.
Majorga also said he went to the police station and had done a vision of his wounds in the hospital, but then agreed to resolve the problem outside the court because he felt "fear would get revenge" and worried "will be shamed in public."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's constantly been traumatized by that incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italian Juve club with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: England 'will regret forever' the loss of carmakers
England "will regret forever" if she loses her status as a world leader as a car producer after Brexit, says the Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added Toyota, England had told BBC that if England left the European Union without a deal, for the time being it would stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border postponement if there was no deal, it would damage Brexit in terms of work costs.
The factory in Burnaston - which made Auris and the production of Toyota - produce almost 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported to the whole European Union.
"My opinion is that if England comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we'll see a production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's execution in Burnaston.
Another British car producer has expressed concern about their exit from the European Union without a deal about how cross-border trade would go, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for instance, said he'd close the Mini factory at Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem related to what the carmakers said was the risk of supply chains if there was no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on the "time-to-time" production principle, with every 37-minutes of both English and European manufacturers for a car that was made on the order.
If England left the European Union without a deal on March 29, there might be a disturbance on the border, which industry believed could cause delays and lack of ties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to save more than a day's supplies at the Derbyshire factory, the company's representative word, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark says the Chequers Theresa May plan for relations with the European Union in the future is "an accurate calibration to avoid checks at the border."
"We have to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only enjoy success at this moment, but for us to get this opportunity," he said to the BBC Radio 4 program.
"The evidence is not only from Toyota but also the other producers, that we really should be able to continue what has already been a very good supply chain."
Toyota can't tell how long the production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warns that the increase will reduce the plant's saing capacity and will ultimately damage the cost of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the director of the United Workers' Union at the factory, says that his members have become more concerned: "As my experience, as soon as this job goes away, it will never come back.
The government speaker said, "We've put forward the right plan and made sense for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be back to be delayed, after the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with the High Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "released another week" because the high court leader Brett Kavanaugh is still on, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the interference of Russia in public elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia's helpers, and the potential that hinders justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire a high-ranking deputy, who will jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has been triggering gossip in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a telegram to record a conversation with Trump and was likely to see the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein objected to the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of the report that he was going to resign.
On the other hand, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he'd "choose to no" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was rescheduled to avoid confrontation with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of them would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's claim, which was due to delay the full vote of the Senate.
Secretary of the Trump press, Sarah Sanders, performs on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "The date for the meeting is not set, so it could be this week, I can see that putting it off to another good week also considering the other things that happened in the high court.
But let's just see and I've always wanted to share the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace's interviewer asked him why.
Sanders said that the meetings were rarely because they didn't like TV reporters trying to draw attention, though, he said: "I disagree with the fact that they were trying to draw attention."
Then he proposed that immediate contact between Trump and the press be improved.
"The president did more of the questions directly than the previous president," he added without mentioning the evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, says Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried more often to do it and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting high officials.
The press conference is rarely happening.
This week in New York, the president might show us why, doing a free and sometimes weird look before the reporters gather.
Health secretary wrote to European workers in NHS Scotland about concern over Brexit problems
Health Secretary has written a letter to the European Union staff working at NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the state and hoping they will still work here after Brexit problems.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until England drew itself from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed itself to meet the regular status costs of EU citizens working in public services that are transferred.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between England and the European Union on this withdrawal are still continuing, approaching the expected decision at this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for the possibility of a scenario.
I know this must be very disturbing to you all.
That is why I now want to reaffirm how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union, and others, carry valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance health services, and benefit the patients and the society we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Aberchromie was conducting an emergency operation after suffering head injury
Behind Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury in the defeat of 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodoros on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Head Coach Tennessee, Rod Reed told the injured reporters shortly before the deal was over.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," said Reed.
Coach and medical personnel give Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it in the backyard and taking it to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the operating room at Vanderbilt's medical center.
Harris adds that "there's no detail about the type/grade of injuries experienced" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, this two-lined student, was in his first season with the Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five shekels on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made the totals of this season 18 shekels.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher material costs when buying properties in England
Foreign buyers will be charged higher material costs when they buy properties in England, along with extra money that will be used to help Tunawism according to new plans Tory
This step will halt Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The costs of this material will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in England
The Finance Department estimates that it will collect up to £120 million a year - to help the Tunawism
Foreign buyers will be put on higher standards of material when they buy properties in England - with additional money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to curb the success rate of the efforts of Jeremy Corbyn in attracting young people with promises to provide more attainable housing and high income targets.
Costs of materials will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in England, along with additional money that motivates the Government to fight a bum.
Additional costs - which are additional costs on the current cost of materials, including the higher level that was introduced two years ago on the second house purchase and the home purchase to be rented - up to three percent.
The Financial Department expects this move to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built properties were purchased by non-English citizens, causing price increases and making it more difficult for the first buyer to set foot on the residential stairwell.
Many rich areas in this country - usually in the capital city - have become "ghost cities" because of the many foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for cutting the cost of materials to help more young people have their first home.
He accused the large construction company of maintaining the price of a permanent property by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to ignore quotas for the homes reached to improve the "hospitable housing" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of promising reforms in interesting housing, including rent surveillance and ending "no guilt".
He also wanted to give greater power to the council to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: "Last I promised I would dedicate the Prime Minister's office to restoring the English dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our leaky housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to stay, work, and build life here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in England, as well as for foreign - based companies, to buy homes that are easy to live in.
For many people dreams of having a house to be a very distant thing, and the behavior of the people is not insolent against the bum.
Jack Ross: 'My main ambience is leading the Scottish team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross said his "principal ambition" was to be Scotland's manager on some stage.
This 42-year-old Scottish player enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently occupies the third rank in League One, unlike three points of the top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to set up my country as a player.
I got a B hat and it was him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I'm big and often watching Scotland's team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it's always been something interesting to me to come back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Manager Sunderland before Ross, among others Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former Alloa Athletic boss said he didn't feel afraid to follow the tracks of great names in that big club, after he had previously rejected the offer of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, no longer hesitated to be in the Premier League," he said.
"Don't be easy to be there, but I'll probably just see myself as the one who works here, if I can bring this club back there."
Karier Ross in team management only three years, after some time as an assistant boss in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coach staff in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to third position, and turned St Mirren from the cliff of degradation into the winner of the championship title next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"This may be the intersection that I have to cross," he recalls when taking over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm fine, making a living in a reasonable way, and enjoying some reasonable things.
But playing can be hard.
Many things you have to go through every week.
I'm still in work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt throughout my adult life."

Survey found, the right time for a beer is 17.30 on Saturday.
Summer waves have increased the revenues of British pubs struggling to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
Numbers indicate that pub and bar groups see the rise of sales of 2.7 percent in July - but income in restaurants goes down by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who compiled those numbers, said: "The sun that shines hot and participates in the British World Cup longer than expected means, the month of July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where the income of the pub increases by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that get a hard blow.
It's coming down at 1.8 percent of the restaurant trade in June is going to get worse in July.
The pub and bar sales that are selling drinks so far are the strongest compared to what happened at the downside restaurant.
The pub that sells food also suffers from the heat of the sun, even though the restaurant operator is not separated.
Looks like people just came out for a drink.
Selling all over the pub and bar that sells drinks up 6.6 percent for this month, with who sells food down three percent."
Paul Newman, recreation analysts and RSM hotels said, "This has been continuing the train we've seen since April.
The weather and the impact of large social events or sports remains the biggest factor in the sale of markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, even though the decrease of sales of 4.8 percent from year to year will be very painful over the current cost pressure.
The long summer should not come at a time when the operator who sells food will experience bad times, and time will tell us whether the temperature is good enough that we have enjoyed in August will give us a little rest."
Total growth in sales throughout the pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, showing the bridge on the launch of the brand.

One in five children has a secret social media account they hide from their parents
The survey revealed, one of five children -- some of them still 11 years old -- have a secret social media account they're hiding from their parents and teachers
Survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed the development of "False Insta" page
This news has raised concerns about the posting of the sexual content
Twenty percent of the students say they have "especially" accounts to show the parents
One of the five - some of them are still 11 years old - make social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed the rapid development of the "False Insta" account - a reference for a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised the concern that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they operate the "mainly" account that has been cleared to be shown to their parents, while they also have a personal account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager who asked someone else for "my rape."
Research carried out by the British Digital Awareness and Conference of the Head of School" and the Head of School of Women" (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them claiming to hold personal records.
Chief HMC, Mike Buchanan said: "This is so disturbing to many teenagers who try to create online space that their parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be a voice to the athletes at the Scotland Athletic Council
Eilidh Doyle has been chosen to join the Scottish Atlantic Council as a non-executive director at the annual annual meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is a track athlete and Scotland's most widely praised field and President Ian Beattie describes this movement as a great opportunity for those leading the sports field to benefit from various international experiences over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly honored throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we believe athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I acted as a voice to the athletes and I hoped I could really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
America's athletic athlete, who won 200 meters and 400 meters on the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, is among the total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC expert, cannot now walk after an ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day a month ago I suffered from stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said it was only a time to determine if I could recover and get back to the level of recovery.
It's like a very tiring job to get back to full recovery, learn how to walk back, and today do some practice!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertising that compares mother to cow has broken down opinions in the online world
The breast pump company has diverged opinions in the world online with an advertisement that compares the mother who is famished with the cattle being poisoned.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be "the pump that can be used with the first silence in the world," the Elvie consumer technology company issued an advertisement inspired by the video music genre to show the freedom this new pump gave to express a mother.
Four moms dance in the barn with a cow straw following a song that spells like this: "Yes, I'm bluffing myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you don't notice it's not ambiguity, this is my breast."
It goes on to refrain: "Pumpa out, pump out, I feed them dear, pump out, pump out, pump out, I water my lady's milk."
However, advertisements published on the Facebook page of this company have led to online controversy.
With 77,000 seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a varied reaction from viewers, with many who say this causes "worship" in the milk industry.
"A very bad decision using cows to advertise this product.
Like us, cows also have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, except for their babies stolen from them in a few days after giving birth," wrote one.
Elvie's breast pump is very pass in BH coursing (Elvie/Ibu)
Another comment: "Trauma can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But why don't you use it to advertise a breast pump for the mother who has to look after her baby?"
The others added: "A missing commercial."
Someone else stood up for the commercial, with a woman confessing that she found the song "sweet."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still feeding.
Mining makes me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial was kind of crazy, but I accepted it.
It's a brilliant product," wrote someone.
The other comments: "This is a pleasant commercial for mothers who blackmail (often at their place of work or toilet) and feel like "a cow."
It's not a commercial that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt danced with hidden pumps stuck in their arms.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the occasion of many women who blackmailed ASI who said they felt like cows.
But Elvie Pump is really hening, without wires or tubes and passes in the bra sucking, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while blackmailing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "Elvie pump is a proper carrier product launched with convincing and provocative.
Comparing the image between expressing women and our silver cow wants to pump the ASI and all the obstacles to its challenge, and showing it through the way of comfort and fun with the full freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has become the main news.

Hundreds of Migran Children silent at the Tende Camp in the Texas Border
The number of migrant children being held is increasing even though the crossing of the monthly borders is still unchanged, partly due to the harsh statements and policies introduced by Trump's government that makes it difficult for children to attend to sponsors.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are immigrants without documents, and fear that they will endanger their own ability to stay in that country by stepping forward to save the children.
Risk is rising in June, when the federal government announces that the next sponsor and other adult members of their household must deliver fingerprints, and the data will be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the field of Immigration and Cukai Bea, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor children under the age of youth.
The agency then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested didn't have a history of criminal records.
"About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of sponsoring groups are illegally present in this country, and most of them are bad foreigners.
Then we keep hunting for them, for Lord Albence.
Aimed at prosecuting children faster, officials introduced new rules that required some of them to attend court within one month after being arrested, not after 60 days, which had been a previous standard, the security workers' clauses.
Most of them perform through video conference calls, not directly, to plead their legal status to immigration judges.
Those who are considered unworthy of getting help will be deported directly.
The longer the children are arrested, the more likely they are to become more anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape efforts, workers' speech and system reports received in the last few months.
The lawyers say the concern is increased in a larger facility like Tornillo, which signs exist in a child struggling to tend to be ignored, because of its size.
They say that moving the children to the camp city without making enough time for them emotionally or saying good-bye to their friends can worsen the trauma that has been fought for.
Syria asks the U.S., French and Turkish forces to immediately retreat
Speaker in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return, even though the country's war had now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who was also a deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces occupied Syria illegally, for reasons of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with in due course."
"They must withdraw as soon as possible and without applying any conditions," he said to the council.
Moualem points out that "the battle against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million refugees from their homes.
He asserted that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we cleaned up all Syria's territories" from the terror groups and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially training and affecting Kurds and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in war - torn territory.
With regard to the problem of refugees, Moualem stressed that they should immediately return, and he blamed "a number of western countries" for "declaring extraordinary fear" that drives refugees to go further.
"We have asked for international society and humanitarian organization to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politicize what should be a complete humanitarian problem."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was agreed.
The UN diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the grave of the last major rebellion of the Idlib has given rise to an opportunity to continue the political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevents major attacks by the Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where there are three million people living.
But Moualem asserts that it has a "clear time frame" and induces that military action will target the Mujahids include fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, which "will be overwhelmed."
The order of the United Nations Staff de Mistura hopes to quickly convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of the government and opposition members to create a post-war space for Syria and open the way to public elections.
Moualem sets out the terms of the Syrian government's membership in the committee, stating that the panel work must be restricted "to review the latest UN-Undang chapters," and warns against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win another general election in 2020 except for many liberals who hope, prosecution and scandals will soon end their presidency.
There's no doubt, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
Until now, there are no signs of weariness for the audience.
Since 2014, the main CNN hour rating has increased more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC nearly three times to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million main-time viewers, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has been hosting the peak cable TV rating with 3.5 million viewers on the night of the main news.
"This is a spirit that makes people interested in because of something that they don't understand," said Neal Baer, an ABC drama player "Designed Survival," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Sneaking Into Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He remembered going up a cab in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give Trump his voice.
Why? She asked.
"He said, "Because he made me laugh," Miss Scovell told me.
The value of entertainment is evil to one’s mind.
Of course, unlike any other TV show, the story from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family can reunite and restore the global economy.
On top of that, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
However, not just being a citizen of the six-hour-old nation you found yourself watching panels of experts discussing the use of the "back" source Bob Woodward for his book called "Fear," wearing Paul Manafort's bird coat of arms worth $15,000 ("the thick clothes with pride," "The Washington Post) and the involvement of Stormy Daniels' terrible description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario the same again.
"The part of the policy he did made it the same as a real event that cheers you up every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator "Pawn Stars," about the show scene and the story of Trump's daily story (choosing an hostility with NFL, commending Kim Jong-un).

He couldn't set himself free, not with Brett Kavanaugh prepared to face the Senate Justice Committee and next to the Supreme Court according to its balance.
"I remember when we did all the crazy shows on that day and people said, "This is the beginning of the Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's like a joke, but it turns out they're right."

A lot of money from outside has flooded the most severe part-time election competition in the White House.
Pennsylvania 17 had the money flow, thanks to the restoration of the district of congress that offered two privileges in the same chairing.
The recently re-established Pittsburg District, filed Conor Lamb of Rep. Democracy - which won the chair in another district through the special election of last spring.
Lamb is advancing against another country, Keith Rothfus Republic, now representing the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which is collapsing with the new Pennsylvania 17 district.
These maps were re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were non-constitutionally on the side of the Republican Party.
The competition in the new Pennsylvania district 17 has resulted in a massive campaign fund between the major party finance side, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in March's special election, which was widely watched for Congress District 18 Pennsylvania.
The seat has been occupied by the Republican Party officials for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts send the Democratic party a little higher.
The U.S. Considering Sentences to El Salvador for Supporting Tiokok, then Back
The diplomats made sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama had admitted Beijing, giving a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and booked hotels in Panama until his partner expelled the Trump Organization management team.
The Foreign Department president decided to withdraw the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "new decision that no longer recognized Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department speaker, appeared in a statement earlier this month.
But the punishment was only considered against El Salvador, who had received help at about $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed punishment, which includes a cut in financial support and the limitation of visas, will harm the Central American state and increase its levels of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meeting took place, the North and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue the same meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in the mid-September, senior government officials confirmed that they wanted further conference, to effectively end the trial for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal to the government at the meeting, arrest the diplomats.
And three U.S. envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new reproofs or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate put forward by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal assessment of this unclear state.
Their statements are reinforced by an outside analyst close to the government and also talking about this unclear state of affairs.
Study Story
Another startling story is Robert Mueller's special advisor report on the possibility of Mr. Trump's arrest, which is currently very important evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller's report also discusses whether Trump's campaign is colluding with Russia in attacking our public election.
When Congress moves hands, Mr. Trump will be asked to take responsibility for him, just as he prepares to go again in front of the electors, and may eventually become judges of his partners.
So there's still a lot to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's government cannot be avoided - or his equality in Europe.
There's a better choice we make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West were against him and to support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of slaughter.
The beginning of history revolves around that sort of intersection, and the fast - paced or postponed democracy is inevitable.
Now Americans face a few points of this change.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man watching for the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since then reporting that, last year, she recommended that the president be quietly recorded and held that she was not worthy of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times wasn't right.
"How do we respond if the recent F.B.I. investigation asked by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair--or if he was brought to the Supreme Court even if there were strong charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to give the part-time voice to Congress that's gonna ask for Trump's answer?
If we fail to pass the test, democracy will get worse in a long time.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once lived in my big embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Saturday candle on a table with a swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope of our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans feels optimistic about fighting Rapid Vienna
Rangers hailed Rapid Vienna on Thursday, triumphing over Austria, following good progress in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will strengthen their position to escape from the European G League Group.
The knee injuries made the mid-seat of Graham Dorrans could not perform in the first season until the result 2-2 against Villarreal, but he was sure that Rangers could use the result as a pajamas stone toward a larger one.
"This bridge is great for us because Villarreal is a great team," the 31-year-old player.
"In this match we're sure we can get something and go by bending one point.
In the end, we might be able to do that, but we believe, the results may be fair.
In the first round, they may perform better but in the second round, we rise and become a better team.
Starting on Thursday, tonight is another big European day.
We hope to be able to bend three points even though it will be a difficult match because they have good results in their last games, but, with support behind us, I'm sure we can go on and get positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there's a very good hope in this club.
This squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's good practice.
Hopefully now we can grow, put the past behind us and achieve success."

Although the surveyers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only a few people discussed the matter with their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the long-term care costs with their partners.
Only 10 percent of them say they're talking about this with their kids.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start the discussion," said Holly Snyder, the vice president of the nation's soul insurance business.
Here's the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: you won't be able to prepare your own family to provide care if you don't tell your wishes first.
Brace yourself with counseling with your family, where and how you get treatment, because what you choose will mean very important in determining the cost.
Place your financial advisors: Your advisors can certainly give you his help in showing you how to pay those costs.
Your choice of long-term care includes traditional long-term care policy, hybrid cash policy that guarantees these costs or insurance yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: Face the legal debate that's upsetting.
An immediate hint of power for your health care, that is someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee if your desire is carried out by professional people when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, a letter of power in the matter of money should also be considered.
Someone who trusts to take care of all your financial decisions must choose, other than to make sure your bill is paid if-if you cannot.
Always remember with every detail as little as any: Just imagine when your elderly parents are in emergency health and on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer questions about treatment or allergies?
Note such details so that you are ready to answer.

A man shot in the wind at Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind gun on his way home from a party at night.
The 40-year-old victim is in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots about the chest, the stomach, and the hand.
The shooting event is described by an officer about 2:30 BST, and is said to be "random."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries that the victim suffered did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses had been brought by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis hit Indonesia
Earthquakes and tsunamis were so devastating that the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, had wiped out a small number of 384 souls, the officers ’ arrests, and the number of dead victims was expected to increase.
He broke off the communication and made the officers of the difficult aid to obtain information from the Doganda Regiment, a region on the north side of the Palu town that was closer to the earthquake center that struck with the strength of 7.5 Richter scale.
In the tree, after disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below this is a number of major facts about the cities of Palu and Dogula, on the island of Sulawesi:
It was the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located on the narrow shores of the western coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, this city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Domulaa, in the meantime, is an area of over 300 km (180 miles) from the coast on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
This county, which is an administrative area below the province, is estimated to have 299,200 people in 2017.
The main economic eyes in the South Sulawese province are looking for fish and crop-hunting, especially on the coast of Dongiana.
However, the development of nickel is also important in this province, although most of it is centered in Morowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
It's been recorded in the last 100 years, the Palu and Doggiana have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Relief Board.
In 1938, over 200 people died in a tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes in the state of Doldama.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in western Donggana.
Seismicly, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Chain and because of the orderly earthquake.
A number of earthquakes and tsunamis that have plagued the last few years are as follows:
In 2004: 26 December, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, on the western coast of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, which eventually eliminated 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half the dead victims were in Aceh.
In 2005: By the end of March and the beginning of April, a series of devastating earthquakes had struck Sumatra’s west coast.
On the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
In 2006: The 6.8 - magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most dense island in Indonesia, resulting in tsunamis on the south coast and nearly 700 deaths.
In 2009: An earthquake struck 7.6 in the nearby city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
The victim died more than 1,100 people.
In 2010: One of the islands on the island of Menaurai, after Sumatra, was hit by a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake, which triggered a 10 - foot - [10 m] tsunami that left some 20 villages and killed 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya, Aceh, also had a shallow earthquake and resulted in the destruction, and the panic of people who remembered the destruction of the earthquake and tsunami that died in 2004 last year.
Although tsunamis did not take place this time, over 100 people died from the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, called the tourist island, also suffered a massive earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of which were on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake ravaged thousands of buildings and while oversaw thousands of tourists.

Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake until at least 384 people died.
The 7.5 - scale earthquake that could trigger tsunamis has struck thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are cut off, and death rates are expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake at that time struck the middle of Sulawesi, which is located in the east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show how far the disaster is going through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the town of Palu at that time, when the tsunami broke up.
The federal prosecutor's attempt to execute the rare death penalty for a terrorist suspect in NYC
The federal prosecutor in New York attempted a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- the punishment included rare and had not been carried out in the federal crime-related state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was expected to undertake an attack by crashing his rented truck from Home Depot to a pedestrian and a bicycle driver on a bike route along the West Side Highway at Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death sentence, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "inventively" killed the eight victims and "inventively" caused serious injury, on the basis of a statement of willingness to execute the death penalty, which was submitted to the South New York District.
On the basis of the court documents, the two charges allow for the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal juridical board dragged Saipov on 22 charges, including eight criminal charges of murder in carrying out acts of rape, which usually used federal prosecution in cases of organized crime, as well as allegations of violence and attempted motor vehicle damage.
According to prosecutors, the attack requires "substantial planning and initial termination," as a description of Saipov's crime done with "measuring, cruel, and barbaric."
Expressed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss of family and friends from Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims at the incident are Argentine tourists.
Counted a decade since the New York South District filed a death sentence last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of killing two drug users, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last execution of the death penalty in the federal court of New York in 1953, was dropped in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were found guilty in the spy conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not show regret as it walked the day and month after the attack.
When asked by the investigator, he said that he was happy with what he had done, to arrest the police.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that his attack was inspired by the ISIS video from his phone, as was the content of the charge.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be put in his hospital room, for the police.
He said he was innocent of 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the federal generals representing Saipov, said "clearly disappointed" against the prosecution's decision.
"According to us, the decision to execute death rather than receive a life sentence sentence sentence without bail will only prolong the trauma of the people involved in the incident," said Patton.
Prior to that, the Saipov defense team had applied to the prosecutor to refrain from bringing a death sentence.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for the Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage calls for 'pourishing the people's camp' today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians had to make the heat of Eurosceptics - because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested to join in the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative support, Peter Bone, told street action in Birmingham that England 'should be out' today if only Farage served as Secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenges that May faces in the reconciliation of his shared position have been beset by supporters of Remain Tories who joined in separate protests threatened Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fought to defend his Chequers engagement plan to remain in his path even in the midst of the Brexitiers, Remainers and the European Union.
The Allied countries point out that he would be moved to advance to reach a deal with Brussels, even though he had a bad reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and labour to decide between his demand packages and the 'impairment'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave mass in Solihull that he wanted 'to get rid of the Chequers.
The translation, that Farage should appoint partners to be given responsibilities in negotiations with Brussels.
"If the manager stays with him, we'll be out now," he says.
Parliamentarian Wellingborough added: "I'm ready to stand up to support Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
He said to the European Union, "We have not fought in the world war to be submissive.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.'
Bone says that the public opinion has been potentially changing since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the English people's thinking has changed and wants the conditions, that's absolutely not true."
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, put it to the press: 'Simple, I want to say, 'O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Checkers are not popular in the public, while Opposition won't pick them, because they're not popular with our parties and our activists who really get down to the street and make us elected in the first position.
Our petition, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us.'
By a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister will maintain their work when their appointment is extended."
Farage said that the political demonstration had to be broken so that it could be 'heated' if they wanted to disobey the 2016 referendum decision.
‘ This most precious time is the trust between our people and our political groups, ’ he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming to them that 'we will not escape you to do that'.'
He added in a message to the crowds of enthusiastic society: 'I want you to make our political groups, who are preparing to disobey Brexit, also feel the heat.
“ We are moving the citizens of this country to win us over to Brexit and will never give up until the independent British government, its own government, and its pride. ”
Meanwhile, the Remainers mass moves through Birmingham before calling for action in the city center for two hours.
The active line seems to spread the Tories Against Brexit Spaniards after triggering the line at the end of this week.
Companions in the Manga line, Lord Adonis, are making fun of the Conservative group on the security issue of their party's application when the conference is opened.
"These are the people who told us that they could master the IT system and all technology for Canada, whatever, for the anti-drug border, in the endless free trade order in Ireland, heals it."
‘ Really, really, really.
There's no good Brexit at all,' he healed.
Warren's planning on a serious strike in the president's
Senator Elizabeth Warren said he'd "break the president's caller" after the election moment in November.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party declared its future in the city hall in the western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who repeatedly threatened President Donald Trump, called himself for the re-election in November against the state's GOP representation, Geoff Diehl, the chief of Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was marked against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, which has been called the city hall since Trump settled.
A guest asked her questions, did any plans run as president.
Warren said, "This is the right time for women to enter the circle of Washington to restore our broken government, and it's a time for women to occupy the summit."

Ajang Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after the team admitted victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear when Valtteri Bottas was in front of Lewis Hamilton in a qualifier on Saturday that would bring the Mercedes team's order to play a big part in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton because he held his position in the first round of the first two and pulled Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel became the first to drive into the pit and let Hamilton move into the bends at the end of the crowd, something that should be very determined.
Mercedes entered pit one lap after and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton kept going after some follow-up actions showing the resistance of Ferrari's driver to leave the inside empty with the risk of surviving after double motion to survive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started off on the back grid line and was in the seventh position at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the races because he held up the tire replacement to target quick resolution and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth position.
He finally got into the pit on the 44th lap but couldn't raise his step on the eight laps left because finally Raikkonen took the fourth position.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
Tim has done an extraordinary job to have two," Hamilton says.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein in a relic on Saturday through his village, he didn't issue a letter from Christine Blasey Ford concerning the sexual assault on Judge Great Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking in a relic in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee, instead of commenting on what is going on in the senate that shows people that "bad and ugly and dishonest."
"Something can happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see the angry and the evil and obscene and dishonest people," he said.
"When you look at the amps and leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak it," he added, as a senator's impression.
Feinstein has sent a letter explaining the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July last, and it has leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leaks were not from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak the story," said Feinstein to the committee, delivered Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret and I kept her secret as she asked."
But his rejection seemed to be disapproved by the president, who commented during the relic on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president was impressed by the idea of democracy using the charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see crime, greed, they don't care who they hurt, what they have to walk for power and surveillance," mediaite reports on president's speech.

Airborne Driver Dies to Set Rates of Passengers on Fire-Sustained Vessels
An air traffic guide in Indonesia was called to be a hero after his death while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
Over 800 people died in the world and many others disappeared after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The earthquake continued to rock the region and many were trapped in ruins in the town of Palu.
But his companions fled for their safety, a 21-year-old man, Anthius Gunawan Grande, refused to leave his post in a heavily rocked guide tower in Sis Al Jufri Highland, Palu.
He chose to survive to make sure the 6321 Baltic Air Flight which at that time was on the runway, can safely take off.
He then jumped from the traffic guide tower when he felt that the tower began to collapse.
He died after he was in the hospital.
Speaker of the Indonesian Flight Navigation Navigation Service Agency, Yohannes Siraria, made his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from the ABC Australia news.
We provided a helicopter from Balicpapan in California to take her to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached the Palu.
"We're all sad to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities worried that the victim died could reach thousands after the National Disaster Authority issued access to the city of Dongga, Sigi, and Boutong.
"The body is believed to continue to grow because many of the remains of the ruins and many others that cannot be achieved," said the national authorities of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho disaster relief.

The river Niudini delivered on a release on Saturday afternoon, the party was unable to identify a passenger.
The police said his side had worked with the local authorities, the hospital and the inspector to find the man.
The authorities are not quick to respond to the demand for more details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crews, after the aircraft hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The officer announced on Friday that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The experts deliver six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, and they are all in a stable condition.
What causes an accident and a complete sequence of events is still unclear.
The second U.S. airline and Navy reported a plane landing in the lagoon around the runway.
Some witnesses feel that the plane is beyond the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's really something good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to run up the waist through the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He's talking to the freaking and screaming people, and he's having a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close to the fixed docks also helped rescue by using rubber boats to transport people to the land before the plane sinks at about 30 meters (100 ft) in the water.

Analysis of the U.S. Justice Department Paul Rowlett's testimony for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a huge line for the jury about how he used his cell phone footage to gather the movements of the defendants at 29 years of age Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received the location data from a number of cell phones that showed Tellis was at one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to the reverse with the previous defendant's statement, announced Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone at one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis told the truth when he said that he was in the Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies presented by Tellis were his claims that he knew Chambers about two weeks before the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate that they know each other within a week.
Rowlett announced that after Chambers died, Tellis sometimes removed messages, calls and contacts Chambers information from her phone.
"He wiped the victim out of his life," said Hale.
Preparations are scheduled to begin the closing statement on Sunday.
The judge indicated that he hoped the trial would lead to the jury after that day.
The High Breed: What's the hip hop spirit?
A group of hip hop trio wanted to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who came from Bristol, claimed hip hop moves away from the origin of political message and removed social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip hop popular spirit again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen these recent resurrections in the UK through some artists like Akala and Lowkey.
The other black people?!
Ny's nanny demanded a couple because they attacked after delivering a "realistic" message.
A New York nanny demands one couple because they have attacked discriminatively after receiving an indirect message from a mother who concurs and declares that she's "the other black."
The couple refused that they were considered racist, and considered it more like "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed his anxiety when he realized that the new care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black as soon as he was on his first day of work in 2016.
"I don't think anyone else," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Miss Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, stating that they were taking out the nanny, who was a mixed African-American citizen, because he had done a bad job and he was expecting the Philippines more, based on New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then returned to Uber.
At this point, Maurice demanded that the couple give compensation for the cancellation, and asked for compensation for about $350 a day for the six-month term, in return for the loss of the caretaker's initial work, even if without a contract.
"I want to show them, see, you can't do something like that," she said to the Post on Sunday, then add "I know it's discrimination."
The couple oppose the claim that they claim to be racial, to say that the worker who was fired Maurice is a fair thing to do, they worry they can't trust him after he's offended.
"My wife has sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband said to the Post.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been rude to, even though it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As if wrapped in "expression," his wife's Plasco said just two months of giving birth to her baby and being in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone who's in such a condition?
It's not a good thing to do," investment bank adds.
As the legal case is still under way, the court of general opinion has made rapid complaints against the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitudes and logic.
The Paddington publisher is worried the reader would not have anything to do with the bear talking, the new newspaper being revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born not far after her book had been received, was explained in a letter.
Very funny to know how we know about the great success of Paddington."
Says his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspired by a child's book with a bear toy, who would be very optimistic about the work he had been denied, he added a year-old publication of the 60th book that felt "sweet" after his father died last year.
For Paddington, who he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father quite proud of his final success.
"He's quite a quiet man, and he's not a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington means a lot to him, it's like you have a child who has gotten something: you're proud of them even though not all your efforts.
I think he looks at Paddington's success like that.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter had been taken to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors had failed to save her.
"Nad made a call calmly to convey it really bad. That he's very likely not going to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said he would die in a cage two minutes ahead and he asked me to say good-bye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors have given them to keep their hearts beating slowly and leave their system.
He's died a few moments of treatment and everything feels like it's dead.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't moan, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers - without realizing what had been through her.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head is drowsy and my tears keep dripping all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but while in that flight I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much she loves him."
The grieving women put a card to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones were trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages and numbers that can be reached for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They're always saying that his smile's glowing."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11 - year - old brother was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying if there will be any further effects."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can close and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and keep quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who's been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in his lowest point on Christmas Day-- when the kids opened their gifts he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a major trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "That's a barrier in the family.
It's separating us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was in uncertainty when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking for--an investigation that's limited in time, limited in scope--we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr. Flake's experience on Saturday, added that he was afraid of the "break" committee in the middle of the committee's failure.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republic's supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their respite is all due to time.
The legislative election is five weeks away, on November 6th - if, as expected, the Republic does so in a bad way, they will become very weak in their opportunity to make those they want to be chosen sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him meeting with Ashley his wife, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats sit.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea opponents under Kim
The number of people who proliferated from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-a power seven years ago, after a member of Korean parliament.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of South Unity data, said there were 1,127 repairs last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher tariff charged by human smugglers was the key factor.
Pyongyang doesn't give a public comment.
Most Northerners were finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said over 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through Tiokok, which has the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
Tyokok treats loggers as illegal migrants from refugees and often forces them to return them.
The relationship between the North and the South - who are technically still in war - has been greatly increased in the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the delayed negotiations of incriminalization.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between the president of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on a nuclear-free Korean bridge.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Minister Ri Yong-ho blames the US for the lack of progress ever since.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, we will not be able to take down our weapons on our own," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "hissterism," said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Opposition Party leader Nancy Pelosi accused Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of "hissterism" and said he didn't fit his temper to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid thinking that if a woman's performance like that, they'll say 'hissterism'," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Judicial Council Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally objected to the charge that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and having trouble talking about his family and his years of high school.
He also came across a curse on Democracy within the committee, saying that he was accused of "unreasonable and coordinated character killing" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed the witness Kavanaugh proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was abusive to democracy.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democracy," he said.
Pelosi says he'll try to plead if he's agreed, and if democracy gets more votes at the council of the People's Parliament.
"I'll say this way -- if he doesn't tell Congress or FBI the truth, then he doesn't fit just to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he as a Democrat was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision against the Health Services Unit or Roe v. Wade, because he was viewed as an understanding conservative justice.
In the high court, Kavanaugh avoids the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone who's hysterical and old to go to court and expect us to say, 'is it not so great,' says Pelosi.
And the woman needs to handle it.
It's an ethical decency, anger for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"Telling me that's not weird, what do you think?"
He said, "I am helped by a woman who is an executive somewhere, who says that she also weeps when she is angry, but develops a technique which means that she is angry and begins to weep, and says to the man who speaks to her, 'You may think I am sad because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And then he goes on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The tears were shed as a way out of anger in part because he was essentially misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, in a man-dominated office, one time when I cried with unexpressed anger, was that my belly was stabbed by an older woman - a cold manager who was always a bit afraid - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They thought you were sad and would be happy because they thought they succeeded."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, very frustrated, understood that there was no reason for himself not to run himself as president.
"That's not a mature decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone calls it "The Snow Princess and Seven Dwarves."
Since it was too late in the campaign, he stayed behind in the fundraising, and he swore he would not follow the election unless he had managed to raise $2 million.
That's a fight to defeat.
He found out that some of his supporters gave the man $1,000 just gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
When he announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overpowered by emotions - thanks to the people who supported him, frustration with a system that made the fund-raiser so difficult and to target the electorate from the delegation, and the anger against sexism - made it difficult to speak.
"You might think that I'm too nervous," recalls Miss Schroeder about how the press reacts to her.
"You'll think that Kleenex is my sponsor company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write in my mind?
"He's crying?"
How the US-Tiokok trade competition might be good for Beijing
The US-Tiokok trade-fighting fire was so exciting, and when the fight was still far from over, the conflict between the two countries might have been a long-term benefit to Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing the Tiokok key export goods including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
A very significant gesture started this week with a new fare that affected items worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxed half of all goods entered into the U.S. through Tiokok.
Beijing has paid back every time, recently priced up to five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
Tiokok has begged to join the US one-by-one, and the world's second biggest economy won't change soon.
Telling Washington to retreat means following the will, but publicly testifying to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of Tiokok.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its card correctly, the U.S. competitive pressure can sustain the long-term Tiokkok by reducing the dependency between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can make the economic movement of both countries more dangerous than what was previously observed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
The Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says that they are ready to return to volunteer refugees and offer help to rebuild a nation that has been destroyed by over seven years of war.
