The star gives light and heat, because the energy created when the hydrogen atom joins (or fusion) forms a heavier element.
Scientists are working to create reactors that can produce energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take years before we see a useful fusion reactor built.
The steel needle floats over the surface of water because of surface tension.
Surface pressure occurs because the water molecules on the surface that attract each other more powerful than the air molecules on it.
Water molecules create invisible layers on the water surface that allow things like needles to float over the water.
The bar on the modern ice bubble has a double side with an empty gap between them, and these two sides allow for a better grip on the ice, even when it is suggested.

It causes the skater to turn around. If the skater turns right, the skater turns right, if the skater turns left, the skater turns left.
To return to the previous level of energy, those atoms have to throw out excess energy that they get out of the light.
"They do this in a way that emits a small particle of light that is commonly called a photon."
"The scientist refers to this process as "stimulating radiation emissions" because atoms are stimulated by light, which causes photon light emissions, and light is one type of radiation."
The next picture shows the photon's atoms, of course, in the real world photon's much smaller than the image's.
Photon is even smaller than atom-supply things
After operating hundreds of hours, the bulbs finally burned down and the bulbs turned off.
Light bulbs need to be replaced. Please be careful when changing light bulbs.
First, the lamp gearer needs to be turned off or the cable is removed.
This is caused by the electrical stream that flows into the socket where the bulge metal parts are, which can cause fatal electrical stings when you touch the part in the socket or base of the bulge metal while some of them still fit in the socket.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumpes blood.

Triceratops have teeth that can not only cover leaves, but also branches or roots that are very flat.
Some scientists think that Triceratop eats sage palms, which are a common kind of vegetation in the time of Kapur.
These plants look like a tiny palm of crowned leaves that slender and sharp.
A Triceratops can use its strong tortoises before eating the rod.
The other scientists say that these plants are highly toxic, so that no dinosaur will eat them, even though now a sloth bear and another animal like a nut (seed of a dinosaur) may eat leaves or a poisonous fruit.
If you stand on the surface of Io, you'll bobot lighter than when you're on Earth.
The person who bobots 90 pounds [90 kg] on Earth is going to double 16 pounds [16 kg] on Io, which is why gravity has lower pullpower.
The sun doesn't have the likes of the Earth that you can take, the whole part of the Sun is made of gas, fire, and plasma.
Gas becomes thinner as you get away from the center of the Sun.
The extra part we see when we see the Sun called the photosfer, which means "lightball".
Some three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus had a phase, as in the moon.
Phase occurs because only the Venus side (or the Moon side) facing the Sun is lit. Phase Venus supports the theory of Copernicus that states that the planet orbits the Sun.
Later, a few years later in 1639, British astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks observed Venus transit.

Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which is a source of various forms of modern Indian, just like Latin, which is a source of European language such as France and Spain.
By the end of the French battle, Germany is getting ready to invade the British island.
"Jerman called their attack "The Operation of the Sea Lions." Most of the heavy weapons and supplies of British soldiers disappeared when the evacuation of Dunkirk, so their soldiers were quite weak."
"Namun, the Kingdom Navy is still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed the invasion fleet that was sent across the British Straits."
Yet, very few British Navy ships were marching near the possibility of an invasion route because criminals feared that their ships were sinking as a result of German air raids.
Let's start with an explanation of the Italian plan.
It has weaker soldiers and weaker marine forces, although they have just built four new ships just before the war started.
The main target of Italy is the African countries. To seize these countries, they need to have the launch of the troops, so that the troops can sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
For those reasons, they had to clear out British bases and ships in Egypt, and the Italian warship would have to do nothing more.
Now Japan is a country of land, just like Britain.
The submarines were designed to travel deep into the sea, and they remained there for a long time.
The submarines were used in World War I and World War II, when the ship was very slow and had a very limited range of firearms.
At the beginning of the war, they traveled mostly by sea, but as it developed radar and became more accurate the submarines entered the sea so that they could not be seen.
German submarine ships are called U-boats, German sailors are skilled in navigation and operate submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, after the German war was not believed to have many submarines.

The number of original editors varies depending on whether or not the dialects are related.
It is estimated that between 340 million and 500 million translators, some 800 million people can understand that language.
Hindi and Urdu have similar words but different accents; in everyday conversations, those two languages are usually able to understand each other.
About the 15th century, the northern part of Estonia had a strong cultural influence from Germany.

Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools that are used in interactive classes (relating boards, audio and video editing, inspection, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to evaluate your assumption of media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
Interactive design requires project components connected to each other, but also makes sense as a separate entity.
The thickness of the lens is at the focal complexities and the number of lens elements required to obtain the length range of the lens much larger than the main lens.
It's not too much trouble because lens manufacturers reach a higher standard in lens production.
This enables the lens to produce an image of equal quality produced by the lens with a fixed focus distance.
Another loss of the zum lens is the maximum opening (speed) of the lens usually slower.
This causes a cheap lens to be used in less light conditions without the use of a flashlight.
One of the most common problems trying to convert the film to DVD format is overscan.
Most televisions are made to enjoy the public in general.
Therefore, everything that is seen on TV has boundaries on the top, the bottom, and the side cut.

Unfortunately, when you create a DVD, the edge may be cut, and if there is a text that is too down, then the text will be cut too.
Traditional half-century castles have long inspired imaginations, evoked the thought of fighting groups with spears, lunches, and Arthurian knights.
Even when standing in the middle of a thousand - year - old ruins, it is easy to imagine the sounds and aromas of battle in the past, so that the sound of horses can hardly be heard as they hit the rocky roads and smell the aroma of fear that comes from the underground pits.
But is our imagination based on reality, first of all, what castles are built for?
According to the typical features of the period, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more like a fortified house than a real castle.
The window's big glass and its thin walls won't be able to withstand any more attacks.

The balance of power is a system of European countries trying to defend national sovereignty across European countries.
The concept is that all European countries must strive to prevent one country from becoming too strong, and that is why national governments often change their alliances to maintain balance.
The Spanish Penerus War marked the first war with the central issue of power balance.
This marks an important change, because Europe's power will no longer have a right to a religious war, so the Thirty Years' War will be the last war marked as a religious war.

"Attention Deficit Disorder" is a classical neurologic syndrome that defines three series of symptoms, including impulses, disturbances, and hyperactive alloys of excess energy."
"This is not a learning disability, but a learning disorder; it affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, probably about 2 million American children."
Children with ADD find it difficult to focus on things like school duties, but can concentrate on things they like to do, such as playing a gym or watching favorite cartoons, or writing a sentence without a label.
"These children tend to be involved in many problems, because they "are involved in risky behavior, fighting, and challenging the due party" to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated in the usual way.
ADD affects a person's relationship with other friends because other children can't understand why the sufferer acts like that or why the sufferer spells out his own way or his age level is different.
With the ability to gain knowledge and learn as mentioned above, the basic rate of knowledge gained also changes.

Unlike other primates, hominid no longer wears their hands to move or hold a load or to lie on top of a tree.
The hands and legs of the chimp have a similar size and length, reflecting the use of the hand in holding the load while walking with the finger book.
Man's hands are shorter than his feet, with a more straight faucet.
Fossil bones aged 2 million to 3 million years show this hand specialization shift from the pusher to the mover.
Some believe that having many conscious dreams artificially subjugated can often be very tiring.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the result of conscious dreams adding lengths of duration between every state of REM.
With REM less per night, the condition when you're sleeping well and when the body recovers so not often enough so it causes a problem.
It's the same tired as when you wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
It depends on how often your brains try to dream each night.

Robert Hooke, a British biologist, saw a small box in the web with a microscope.
It looks like a room, he's the first person to watch the dead cell.
Elements and living things can move from one condition to another and never change.
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same characteristics as liquid nitrogen. The liquid condition is more dense, but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. Water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure as gas, liquids, or solids.
Although her physical shape may change, her chemical form remains the same.
Time is something around us, and it affects everything we do, though it is so hard to understand.
Time has been learned by scholars of religion, philosophy, and science for thousands of years.

MRI based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance resonance (NMR), found in the 1930s by Felix Block (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field, and radio waves cause the atoms to emit a little radio signal.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and research scientist, found the basis to use magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later a patent was given, which became the first patent in the world to be published in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "body" MRI, which he called the Indomitable.

The tourist visit is expensive, demanding physical fitness, can only take place in the summer in November-February, and is very limited to the jungle, the island, and the Ross Sea.
Thousands of staff live here in the summer in about 40 bases that are mostly in the area; only a few stay during the winter.
Inland Antarctica is a remote highland covered by a 2-3 km ice.
Specialists of air travel once in a while to climb the mountains or borrow the poles. This specialist has a huge base.
South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a distance of 1,000 miles from McMurdo Camp in the Ross Sea to the Pole.
This is a snow that is covered and marked with a flag; it can only be transported with a special tractor, transporting the open train with fuel and supplies.
They're not too fast, so they have to rotate far around Transantarktic mountains to get to the high plain region.
The most common cause of accidents in winter is roads, sidewalks, and especially slippery stairs.
The minimum you need is a foot-and-footer with a suitable sun. Shoes for summer are usually very slippery if used on ice or snow, even some boots for winter are still less good.
The pattern must be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material should be soft enough in the cold.
Some bot shoes have nails on their sides and there's also an additional patched device to deal with slippery conditions, suitable for most boots and boots boots, for tumits or tumits and soil.
The right of shoes should be low and wide. Sands, gravel, or salt (calsium chlorida) are often spread on the highway or the road as a foothills are needed to improve the surface of the ground.
Snow is not abnormal; the last slope can only hold snow to a certain amount, and the excess volume will fall as a long snow.
Personally, the snow is sticky so it needs a number of triggers for the lengths, and the lengths of a number of snows can trigger other snows.
Sometimes the original triggers are the sun’s melting snow, sometimes due to many snowfalls, sometimes due to natural events commonly caused by humans.
Tornado is a very low-pressure air turnover, which sucks the air around it inside and up.
Tornado produces a high-speed wind (often 160-320 km/h) and can lift heavy object to the air and carry it along with the tornado movement.
"It begins with a curve falling down from a cloud storm, and then becomes a "tornado" when it hits the ground."
Personal VPN provider (virtual private network) is a good way to penetrate political sensors and commercial IP location filtering.
It's superior to the web proxy for some reason: Unable to redefine all Internet traffic, not just http.

"The media company routinely lied about this purpose, claiming that it's to "meddlers."
In fact, the area code has no effect on illegal partitions; every copy of a disc will be able to play well on any original device that can be played.

The application of the translator text at once `€' applications that can automatically translate all parts of the text from one language to another.
Some applications in this category can even translate text into a foreign language on a road or other object in the real world when users point smart phones to the object.
The translator machine has grown dramatically, and now often gives a translation that is almost true (wrongly wrong), but still has to be careful because there is still a possibility of error.
One of the most important applications in this category is Google Translate, which can translate without the Internet after downloading desired language data.
Using GPS navigation applications on smart phones you can be the easiest and most comfortable option for navigation devices when you travel out of your country.

Viking crossed the Russian waters to reach the Black Sea and the Kaspia Sea. Some of the routes can still be crossed until now. Check if there is a special permit, which may be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea waters connect the Arctic Sea to the Baltic Sea, through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga, and Saint Petersburg, mostly through rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so it comes from the Kaspia Sea through Russia still possible.

This flight is not the only option if you want to miss the South Pacific and the west coast of North America. (see below)
In 1994, Armenian ethnic groups in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan waged war on Azerbaijani.
