Members of the Galile Nation National Assembly are concerned that they may appear to be "broad"
Many members of the National Assembly of Wales are upset because they were suggested to change their title, respectively MWP (members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the Wales National Assembly is concerned that "he sends with Twp and Pwp".
For readers from outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Wales Party of the National Assembly of Wales said that, overall, the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member said the group had an "open" attitude toward name change, but noted that "MWP" is similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation for the introduction of the name, said: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on even those members.”
The Law of 2017 on the Government of Wales gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the "Galile Parliament".
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred the “Members of the Parliament of Wales” or “WMP”, but the option “MWP” received the most votes in public consultation.
It seems that the members of the Galile National Assembly have suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach consensus might result in Elin Jones, the chairman of the steering committee, who is expected to send the draft law on changes over a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including the disqualification of the members and structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the last word as regards their title when the law will be debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the name change of the country
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on changing their country's name in the "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was organised to resolve an old dispute with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim on its territory and repeatedly opposed Macedonia 's accession to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposition to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not consider this vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is just a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bishops' Clopots have stopped fighting as a result of the problems faced by the churches in Harlem
"Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before you found a bar and a church in every corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today, there are no bars or churches."
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
"Bars no longer have the day-to-day role for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather."
And with regard to churches, it is worried that money from the sale of goods will be spent more quickly than leaders expect and that “ sooner or later the disintegration will be the same.”
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “so this will speed up the closing of churches, because it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these buildings will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations made up of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African-American people, who carried out their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a congregation of Afro-Americans, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, which opposed the hiring or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but Father Johnson's enoriences made plans to rebuild it and included the carion in it.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, called the charillon "the crowds of the poor."
The expert who put the carion into operation in July described it differently: “a cultural treasure” and “a historical tool to be unplaced”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said that he was the first carilo in the world performed by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a bigger carilo at Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What was heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some of them brought to church deacons, others of episcopal diocese.
The church's governing entity, made up of deacons, wrote the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the church, even though it was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the thrilled ones complained about the lack of transparency that has given evidence of the diocese.
A shark hit a 13-year-old kid trying to catch lobsters in California
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child, while he swims, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the homarous season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near the beach Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he swims for about half an hour, along with his friends, on the morning of Saturday, when he heard a little boy screaming for help and then moved along with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel also said that initially he thought the boy was thrilled to catch a lobster, but then he realized that he shouted “He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole clavicle was torn apart, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
“I called out to all those who were in the water, and I told them to get out of the water: “There is a shark in the water,” Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The shark species is not known to be responsible for the attack.
The lifesaver, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that is a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
Authorities restricted access from the Pointo beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury plans to strengthen his position on the market for beauty and fashion products in Britain
Sainsbury takes advantage of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, making available radiances with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with assistants of specialist sales.
As part of a consolidation of position on the UK market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion sales are not to a great extent, the larger rays with wholesale products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several stores in the next year, if they prove to be a success.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Retirement Retirement Retirement Retirement Retirement Officer Sainsbury stated that the number of farm products it offers will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaunchs its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, a growing demand for young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain for testing purposes, the first being the open last week in Croydon, in the southern part of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sainsbury Retailer, said the outlets would increasingly look like universal stores, because supermarket chains are trying to deal with the big retail stores, Aldi and Lidl, which provide more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included products from August Argos in hundreds of shops and Habitats since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means that it has recorded increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The earlier attempt of the supermarket to re-enhanced its pharmaceutical and beauty product compartments failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but the negotiations ceased after a disagreement about how Boots' sales were divided into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business including 281 stores, Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the sales director of the Sainsbury relayer, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our rayon with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations turn us into an extraordinary location to purchase pretty products, revolutionizing the old way to make purchases."
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract
The "Dragons' Den" TV Protagonist Peter Jones is furious after the TV presentation Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes household accessories and items.
The couple company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Plaintow.
Presentation of the 37-year-old "This Morning" show announced that Instagram will withdraw.
Holly Willoughby generated the anger of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the "Dragons‘ Den" show, ultimately withdrawing from their business that offers lifestyle services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most beloved people on television admitted on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, no longer allow her to dedicate herself to their brand, Truly, which includes access and household items.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptoutrew and almost doubled Willoughby's fortune, with an estimated £11 million.
After the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would abandon the Truly contract, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
The statement of one source: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, there was less until the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the presentation of the "This Morning" show, which is among the best sellers in Britain, could bring to the company the damage of millions, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing objects and household items, as well as possible additional delay of launch.
It can also be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S trade mark and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A nearby source of Jones said last night: “We do not want to comment on his business.”
I was very hard, and then "we fell in love"
He made jokes about the critics he will receive from journalists because he has made a comment that some would consider to be "dissensing from a president" and that he has such a positive attitude with regard to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said mimicking a voice of "news presenter".
“I didn’t take a step back.”
He said that Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as an enormous step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have ceased.
Over three months after the June Singapore summit, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world's leaders on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not observe a "corresponding response" from the United States on the previous disarmament marches of North Korea.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on it.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"Everything goes well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve Kim's relations had positive results: ending missile tests, supporting the release of hostages and returning American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act like a president, but if I were to behave in this way, instead of the 10,000 outside people trying to get into this incapacitated arena, it would be about 200 people,” Trump said, pointing out to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help is not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of the Lombok island has been dislocated, no national disaster has been declared, a necessary condition for the launch of aid actions at international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it's a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the “Save Children” Foundation is attempting to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesperson of the Agency for National Disasters, said the Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
In view of the earthquakes sustained by Indonesia, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be sufficiently prepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh , they are not often met on other shores .
It seems that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters also complicate this.
A hospital ship that parked in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that the improvement of the precarious infrastructure in Indonesia be the central point of his electoral campaign and allocated money for roads and railways in advance.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from the Indonesian sectarians, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes, as the Christian and Muslim gangs had broken down on the streets, using bricks, arches and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the goal to save and match the score in the game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League in front of the Chelsea team, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a step from Xherdan Shaqiri, while it was about 30 meters away from the other team gate, and his team was driven by Chelsea by 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a whistle in the direction of the gates.
The ball reached above the one, heading towards the corner of the right up the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed by Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped to her and fell into the gate.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to move forward as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge said for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think very much about it, just, I took the ball further."
Chelsea drove 1-0 at rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned to the middle of the land and ran to half the ground of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick move of one-two in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who entered the path.
Hazard oversaw the defense and sent the ball into the net, succeeding in hitting it with his left foot and passing by the player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Napoli team at the League of Champions on Wednesday at 15:00 on Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the Videoton team in UEFA Europe League Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped under the ruins of the buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and that triggered waves up to 6 meters, the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000 people, has been covered by the remains caused by the collapse of the buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of killing a woman through stabbing.
A crime investigation was started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m., with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a suspected man was arrested.
The police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen something about this subject to come to the department for statements.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in the early stages, but I appeal to all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material with the help of the on-board room to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belongs to a woman from Birkenhead and that it was found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people came to the crime scene who think I know the woman to ask questions about the place she was found in the morning.
The investigations are under way, and the police said they were trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but he was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building have been told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that now the whole area is considered a crime scene.
On the spot, there was a woman in tears.
"It's so awful!"
At 14:00, two dubs of the police were in the perimeter and one was outside it.
A few police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Any person with information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously at phone number 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the most recent memorial monument affected by the altercations on "history description"
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of the so many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell's society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "insanity" and "a attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of states as Oliver Cromwell’s figure from the Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would sacrifice himself for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century and a part of the history of a figure that many believe deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
But surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, which represents a part of this division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve celebrated and commemorated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a South West Chinese market, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only after the name of his name "Yuan", was found dead after an artery was sectioned and was covered with blood, near a pig farm located in the market in Liupanshui, Guzhou province, according to the Sunday editorial of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he had come with his cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby elbow was open.
He said there was a pig in the elbow with large blood in his mouth.
Legal doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were full of blood and finished," said the cousin, whose last name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed their pigs.
After about an hour, his body was found.
The animal that caused the death of the man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative said for Evening News that the pig was closed to stop him from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and authorities negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and their husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a pig 300 kg, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and chase the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions."
“They just play.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, who has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves to colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States in the next days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a hurricane of category 1, on Sunday, from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it began to form a depressive area across the Pacific Ocean and travel east, to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula, Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, he will start pushing the intense tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity that will interact with the depression will generate abundant rains in the southwest in the next few days.
Local rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause rapid dangerous flooding, waste flows and possibly desert landslides.
Intense tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevade and Arizona.
Precipitation between 5 and 10 cm is expected in the south-west, especially in the majority of Arizone.
Rapid flooding may occur due to rapid deterioration conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rain could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into gusts and dust.
The nearby depression area will bring torrential rains to the areas on the south coast of California.
Precipitation of nearly 2 cm is possible, which may result in minor flows of waste and slippery roads.
These will be the first precipitation in the region, in the wet season.
Tropical rains spread will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and in the first part of Monday, before the rain spreads more Monday evening and Tuesday.
The intense precipitation will spread in the so-called "four corners" Tuesday and persist until Wednesday.
In October intense temperature changes will be recorded in the U.S., as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic differences in temperature are found at the U.S. central area level.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Within the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to form and expand again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern parts of the United States will face a hot start in October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the south to certain portions of the northeast.
Tuesday, the city of New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high odds of temperatures above average for the east of the United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people followed the press statement supported by the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a last hour news: an agreement concluded between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona for the FBI to conduct an indictment for a week.
Ford told the court that it is 100% certain that Kavanaugh harassed her while she was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said it was 100% certain that this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have followed the hearing on Friday.
The company counted the average vision on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not available immediately for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a problem with identifying the people who watch from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during daily hearings.
ABC was on second place, with a number of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while the protesters shouted at him and he was trying to get up in an elevator at a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He looked down for a few minutes while people were fighting him, and everything was broadcast live to CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
“Do you think he tells us the truth?
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions then broadcast live the vote on the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he would do this only if the FBI would agree to analyze the charges against the nominee next week, which was demanded by minority democrats.
Flake was mostly convinced of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's election was an important one, obviously the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses criticism of "political games" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Great Britain and undermine national interests in an interview for the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Great Britain, attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the one accompanied by his photograph on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect their reciprocal tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of shooting the LSU player dead
Police arrested a suspect in the case of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with murder of grade 2, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities posted the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered their glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, affiliated CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say he admitted that he shot Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Legal Medical Office published a preliminary report on Friday, saying that death was caused by a gunshot through the neck.
The Department deserves the police force Louisiana, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of that area, for the aid offered in the investigation, which led to the arrest.
Athletic Director LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "dignity and the search for justice."
Sims was 20.
The attacker with a height of 1.98 m grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he scored, on average, 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
Friday morning, coach of LSU basketball team, Will Wade, said the team is "damaged" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This worries me all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano threw a column of ashes above Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexico on Saturday to keep the distance from the volcano after the crater activity began and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several hurdles and vibrations.
The images on the social networks presented thin layers of ashes on the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
The geophysicians observed an increase in the activity of the volcano that is 72 km south-east of the capital, after an earthquake with magnitude of 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflict between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after the pro-independence protesters clashed with the gendarmii, on the first anniversary of the vote for the secession of Catalonia, gathering thousands of opposed demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists held away from gendarmes bombarded them with pure eggs and paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The fight was intensified later, using the police to control the situation.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups scanned “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while Union protestors shouted “Long live Spain.”
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to the local press.
Tension remains at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose, in a large majority, to become independent, although the vote was low, and those against the secession boycotted largely.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at the voting centres in the region, with violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped over Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new way.
Narciss Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hope in the acquisition of independence by Catalonia.
“ Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I watched my parents cry for joy that I can vote, but now we have nothing else to do," he said.
Despite the achievement of a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan pro-independent parties tried to maintain this year, many of the best known leaders either in exile or in detention, waiting for the trial for the role of organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone the protest in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation becomes increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will be candidates for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Many men were arrested after entering a house with their car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on Thursday, about 7:30 p.m. in Ballenagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage to the gates and even the building was caused.
It seems that at some point an armor was used against the car.
Menga's hit helped the Livingston team win with 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team with no reply, Steven Gerrard reaching the second defeat in 18 matches, as manager of the Ibox club.
Dolly Menga's hit turned out to be different while Gary Holt's team played the same level as Hibernian in the second round.
Gerard's team remains without a win on the way to Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to this, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues unbeatable in division until six games, Holt's main coach still feels the taste of defeat because he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against raw visitors
Holt's team should have moved forward long before they enrolled, and their orientation caused all kinds of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and tried to shake the space at the gates, then Alan Lithgow managed to shake wide after he slipped into intercepting the ball sent with the head of Craig Halkett.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause visitor problems at the free strikes.
And that was how the crucial void came to be.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston managed an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to pay attention to Menga, who shook and scored from the center of the one.
At that stage, Rangers dominated his possession, but he faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and the carrier Liam Kelly was no longer at sea disturbed in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second round, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't succeed against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgow hit a lot from another Livingston player.
The diagonal steps continued to come into the seat of Livingston's team, but without success, and the two demands for penalties - after Halkett suddened Glenn Middleton and after a hen - were not accepted.
"Femenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland on stadium Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an ascending trajectory.
Their game style and team have not changed much since the top comeback, but the merits must be granted to Holt for the way he trained his team since taking it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the entire game.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they had good performances since they were led by Gerrard, they did not reach the same standards.
The empty passes were misdirected, they managed only once to catch the gate of the free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Joint reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Köln
It was all pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany to remedy the relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied because of such problems as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Köln to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
The police have invoked security grounds to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but they have gathered enough supporters nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, most Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it with open arms in the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division with regard to a visitor considered a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies following collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the spot.
The accident takes place just a few months after another biker died after an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the scene, which is about a mile away from the place where the accident on Saturday happened.
Metropolitan police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the route of the buses is diverted, and motorcycles are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured following a fight
Six prison officers were injured following a fight at a high-security prison for men, a prison representative said.
On Sunday, there was a fight at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30, this is in progress.
Specialized officers have been brought to deal with the fighting, in which eight prisoners are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers have been treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “The assistance of prison staff was requested to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer time after the graces."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the governor of the prison needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last year, in October, the officers dealing with the disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the personnel being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded because of Hurricane Rosa (the drought zones can enjoy benefits as a result of this)
Tropical depression rarely occurs in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen in the early part of next week, because the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the south-west desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the Western Area of Arizona, South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct path to Phoenix on Tuesday, and the second part of the month will cause precipitation.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix announced in a message on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones maintained a storm condition or tropical depression about 320 km away from Phoenix in 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action on a distance of about 60 km from the border with Arizona."
The latest models of the National Centre for Urbane forecast precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the south-west desert, including in the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, there will be recorded quantities between 3 and 5 cm, with total possible quantities up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in certain areas, torrential rain will be beneficial, as the south-west faces drought problems.
According to the United States Sequestrian Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona faces at least one severe drought and the second largest category of droughts", information found onweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still having hurricane power in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km an hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, 19 km an hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, with a high flood risk.
"The torrential rains are expected between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to north-western Sonora, and can also reach 25 cm", according toweather.com.
Then Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger represented by Rosa or his remains is the extreme torrential rain in Baja California, north-western Sonora and the desert in the south-west of the United States," said a representative of the National Centre for Urbane.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring waste streams to waste, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old person was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, Saturday, about 4:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he was in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The officers requested the help of citizens who might have materials on their mobile phone, respectively, to appear at the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party's "unthankful and angry"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump further stated that Kavanaugh faced the “unthankful and angry” of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress, denying vehemently Christine Blasey Ford's assertions related to having harassed her sex ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting about her statement.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw on that day Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage."
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best legal minds of this generation," he said to many supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of the republican presence in the intermediate elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but in a way, I'm running," he said.
“For this reason, I express my positive view of the candidates I consider to be great.”
Trump claimed that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate from Kavanaugh's nomination will take place on Friday, a GOP assistant for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and a tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach in the murky, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their way.
The Tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, thus becoming victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, at a press conference in Jakarta.
“Tsunami brought cars, trunks, houses, hitting everything that was in the land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled widely at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to climb the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency present several buildings and shops destroyed, overturned and collapsed bridges, as well as a watery mosque.
On Saturday, the appeals continued to shake the town on the coast.
The earthquake series has been felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Indonesia said that the energy emitted by the strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb from Hiroshima in World War II.
Perhaps the geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow golf course, intensified the size of the tsunami, added the representative.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing persons.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely disturbed, without any information," said Nugroho.
There live more than 300,000 people," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
On Saturday, the Agency was severely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had reached the time of the warning.
In the social network posts, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the truth of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major disruption of electricity, which blocked communications in the Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The army began sending freight planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuated people still need food and other basic things.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While the staff of Word Vision from Dogula arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees are imprisoned in improvised shelters in the courtyard of the office, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even though aid groups have begun to launch aid actions in the event of disaster, some have complained that comprehensive foreign workers have been prevented from travelling to the Palu.
According to the regulations in Indonesia, financial resources, materials and personnel can reach the place of production of a disaster only if declared as a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the province level,” Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia, said.
“After what the government will say, “Yes, this is a national disaster”, we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami of Friday in the Palu, the friends and families of the disappeared hoped that the loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, the rescue staff released a woman who had been under the ruins of two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandon, the coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing pilots.
Other people in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandage, were his students.
"In view of the experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after broadcasting news on the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the community of sports enthusiasts with the paragliding, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But by his messages there was only a gray beef, and not two blue beifes.
"I think that means the messages weren't transmitted," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding a Newport on the Levee ATM
Friday morning, thieves stole the sum of $26,750 from a Brink employee that feeds a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied a ATM from the entertainment complex and prepared to transport more money, wrote Dennis McCarthy in communication.
While he was busy, another man “got behind Brink's back ” and stole a money bag that had to be transported.
According to the notice, the witnesses observed several suspects who fled from the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport police at phone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
The Kanye West rapper changes his stage name to "Ye".
He made the announcement on Saturday on Twitter change: "The individual who is officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before it appears at the Saturday Night Live show, where it is expected to launch its new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled "for reasons of emotional nature," said the producer of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation for the current stage name, West previously said that this word also has a religious significance for it.
“I believe that “ye” is the most commonly known word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier this year, in the conversation about the title of the Big Boy Radio Host album.
“So it’s you, it’s me, it’s about us.
It all started from "Kanye", which means the only one, and it came to "Ye", which is a reflection of our good, evil, unclear and of the whole.
The album is more a reflection of what we are as people."
He is one of the most rappers who have chosen to change his stage name.
Sean Combs had numerous stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has changed his name, sometimes with chromium, sometimes without, and also with great letters.
President of Mexico promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military forces against civilians, as soon as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The troops fired at a peaceful market demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left movements of students were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for AI
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on field research, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and the user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after more members of the U.S. government have made announcements about AI, even if an official artificial intelligence strategy is missing in the U.S..
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be at the first place with regard to AI innovation by 2030.
"The double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next AI discovery," Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances that the next major IA achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee said for CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers IA: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that defeated American player Othello, the best in the field at the time, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and President of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated the earlier competitions of American governments in the field of technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Agency, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
"Not China envelops academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired remarkable graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to intensify its efforts by AI.
"I believe that doctoral visas should be offered automatically in AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the Research Institute of the U.S. Army (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called "Next AI".
NSF also invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research at this time.
In the meantime, no changes have occurred in the legislation of the United States with the aim of setting up a Commission for National Security in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians will vote on the referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wanted the country's name to be changed to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a change that would resolve an old dispute with Greece for a decade, opposing its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June with regard to the new name proposed, but the opposing nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign was questionable as to the presence at the vote, and that the minimum limit of 50%, required for the validation of the referendum might not be reached.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: "Do you agree with the accession to the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a price that must be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the spread of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia will live free under the shadow of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
While it is not legally binding, quite many members of parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-third quorum is required in parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that there were no irregularities reported by 13:00.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the people with the right to vote were put to the vote.
"I came to the vote for my children and our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje, the country's capital.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change of Macedonian name, which will allow him to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov prepared a small-scale scene and laid chairs in front of the high tents of those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the top, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“ We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we don't want Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that most will be in favour of name change, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of NATO and the EU," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that a result in favour of changing the name would be "confirming our future."
According to a poll published last month by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
For the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-vestic government policy since the government took over last May.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to cross the entire Brighton team defense and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass the Brighton team's defense and wins the Manchester City team on Saturday with 2-0 on the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed like Aguero was incredibly easy to mark in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker took a step in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
It moved very quickly among three defensive players from Brighton, before it reached the free side of the land.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four opposing team players.
He managed to pass by a defender, and then he passed more right-wing players on the edge of the Brighton team.
After that, he took a step to the left, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English attacker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, succeeding to avoid the carrier at Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a whistle to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero is facing a few foot problems," Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City, told reporters.
"I talked to him and I agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky she signed up an empty at that time."
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial advantage for the Azuri in the Premier League game.
Goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep step on Brighton's territory at that stage.
Then he took a step on Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane pulled the balloon a few times until she sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the gates.
The Azurian attacker hit the balloon to the net right before he headed out of the field.
Manchester City will meet at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday with Hoffenheim in the group phase on Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to hurt the game against Rockies
With the national team removed from the competition in play-off, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win on Sunday in the game against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still implications in play-off for Rockies, which hold an advantage with a game facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies got at least one unpredictable place, with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday, but still trying to keep its first title of division.
“Even if we’re not playing for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here, in Denver, together with lots, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but, according to sources, is inclined to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening of the match number 34, had a heating session Thursday and would throw in normal conditions on this Sunday.
The Washington medium has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2,53 and 300 in 220 and 2/3 games in this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation of making a decision by the Supreme Court as regards Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the republican presence at the intermediate elections.
“All our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the great ones, I don't run, but I actually run, that's why I'm trying to be able to support good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “See this terrible, radical group of Democrats, see what happens right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to crush to get power and control, that they want, to have power and control, and we won't."
He also said that Democrats are on a mission of "resistence and obstruction".
"And you can see that in the last four days," he also said, describing the Democrats as "wrong and evil, naughty and liars."
He referred to the senate of Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and which is part of the Senate's Judicial Committee, which was strongly dismissed by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you disclose the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different point of view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
It didn't surprise me at all that the Momentum activists in my local party supported the motion of censure with regard to me.
After all, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehement in anti-semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the motion of censure was critical to my address because I disagreed with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, which Jeremy did not share with previous leaders.
The Communication for the Friday session in Nottingham East of the Labour Party mentioned that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been so.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not take place this way, and the promise of a "better, gentle" political environment has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party's leadership.
Things started to be like this when Jeremy became the leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom we had a common vision of politics began to expect to change my thinking and agree with some things I would not have agreed with, among them national security or the single EU market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuse on the dissociation networks that demand my elimination from the party, exposing the central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know I'm luckier than my colleagues, because the comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face an abuse of a sexual or racist nature, but they maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with every motion for censorship or change of the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly less flexible on this aspect.
Many people have advised me in the last two years to put my head down, not to be so vocal anymore, and everything will be "well" like that.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the negligence that the Thatcher government has shown, led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them the most, as local adviser or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including at the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues that I disagree with in relation to the current leadership are unclear to him.
People who have supported the motion on Friday can only tell them that, in the context that the country is headed to Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of elimination of party or political opportunism will stop me from taking the decisions I consider in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team arrives at the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late trials have influenced the final outcome in a way, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's extremely interactive game from Tennent's Premiership.
It's now in the top of the ranking, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
Eventually, everything was summed up at their better defenses, as well as the fact that they took advantage of the chances they had, which helped the host team and thanked Coach Peter Murchie.
“We’ve been subjected to several tests during our games so far and we’re still not going to be defeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie de la Melrose said: “The merit is given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of more chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage of the Ayr team, but a yellow carton received from Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who could join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformatted attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, right at the middle of the game, managed to sign up, and then managed to transform an individual attempt, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second rep very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was pulled out of the field with targa, and after the game was resumed, Ayr disbanded through the attempt of the Stafford McDowall player, transformed by Climo.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the spare player pay with an untransformed attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a severe pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for plating Climo without ball, MacPherson managed to mark, offering him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo turned the attempt, as he did again near the re-start of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" movement and sent extreme Gregor Henry into the deep for the fifth attempt of the host team.
"Still Game" Sitcom Vedeta seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the "Stil Game" sitcom, seems ready to move to the hospitality industry after finding out he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis' role in the BBC's beloved show, writing his script and playing alongside his long-standing partner, the comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the number nine, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to be involved in "the restaurant development industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia island hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings hang the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by the motto: "The sea is ours in law.
We have to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which does not come out at sea, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of the resources of the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely to be at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the need to feel, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the outcome with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of strong discussions, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial battle for the re-election of the next year – also has much to gain from the decision of Monday .
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that too few things would change if it happened.
The UN body within the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory belonging to Chile and has concluded that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after the final pleas were heard indicates that this case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only that Bolivia has not been successful in cause, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea was hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have never exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia to the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making process of the court was unusually rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139 years of mutual disagreements," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past.”
North Korea claims nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to abide by the promises made during a summit at Singapore, with the leaders of the rivals.
His comments come within the context where US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume diplomatic actions on nuclear threat after more than three months since the meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it is an "unreal vision" as the continued sanctions and the objection of the United States with regard to the declaration of the end of the Korean war to ever make the territory of the north give in.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement without first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers to be the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation in Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will soon be available in stores
If you're looking for hats to extend your collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring 2019 collection.
At all, the practical hats have conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion creators have sent the creations that steal eyes on the podium.
The piece of resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant, bej-colored hat, with a broad bulge, similar to a penis, in which the heads of the models were sunk.
Other oversized accessories have included beaded pens, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head against the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarous masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had stitched lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not fashion high sewing.
One of the creatures seemed to be a diving equipment, having a oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be an ice-cold cone.
And if you want to keep adopting such a dress style, with oversized dress articles, you're lucky.
The stilists are planning a comeback of huge bonnets in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hair comes after the appearance of the hat "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide bore, seen to everyone, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the hat at all practical that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, respectively, of the payroll pack for the beach, with as large a size as the model in the bathing suit that bears it.
The orange bag of rafia, with rafia fringes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of the 2019 spring collection "La Riviera" of Jacquemus at Week Modei of Paris
The star stylist Luke Armitage said for FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing hats and oversized beach folk in luxury shops in the next summer, because the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a record on academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results at the examination, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), work to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high and high school education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, words reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of the competition this year, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages got a Higher grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools have shown that 72% of students have obtained a Higher grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish have obtained such a certificate.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as matter, are kept as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other areas.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for the reasons that employers gave them to fight for vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
More and more, therefore, language skills become imperative for preparing young people for their future career.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a ability throughout life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to carry a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percent of two digits, 15%.
That is why foreign language investment is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will have greater chances of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more than one language of choice in independent schools, with teaching frameworks that specialize in this field.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills needed to succeed, however the future would be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It must be done well.

LeBron will make his debut at Lakers Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is almost the end for fans who want to see LeBron James as he starts for Los Angeles Lakers.
The coach of Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in the opening of Sunday's prison against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes will he play still remain to settle.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James will probably play limited minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Six Lakers programme of six games in the prison.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need games in the press to prepare myself,” he said.
Trump's election rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins this evening a series of campaigning matches in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump's matches scheduled next week, which include stops in places where the electorate is favorable to them, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for the candidate elected by him for the free place of the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wishes to strengthen support for future mid-term elections as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election rally take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I follow him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., East Coast, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can track Trump's election rally online in West Virginia via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Perhaps Trump will discuss this week's hearing by Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, a hearing that has become tense because of allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, so the FBI will investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of rallyings is to help the Republicans, who face tough elections in November, win a little land.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five next week's matches is “the energy of volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important for its program that the president will travel as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season,” said Reuters, a spokesman for Trump’s campaign, who did not want to be named.
Scheduled to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the media in Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won elections at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is led into the polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder 2018 Cup: U.S. team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to maintain the chance for simple samples starting on Sunday
After three clear-dominated sessions, it's possible that the foursome test Saturday afternoon was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is an invented concept for the sport world, but players even believe in it, all the more in the case of such competitions.
So, where is their motivation now?
"They were leading us six points, now the difference is only four points, so we rely on this decrease for a bit of motivation," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, when there are twelve more points in the game.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won every three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with lethal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those bellows of celebration became increasingly loud as the run progressed, especially when it entered a crucial point by which it brought the score back to equality in the fourth game, after he and Thomas were driven by two points after the first two holes.
The hit that won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to focus and worry about your own game," says Spieth.
That's all these players left.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe won four out of four games and it seems I can't make it wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't need any additional hit Saturday afternoon, but this statement is also valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the new Friday morning points.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic public reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would eventually lead to a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun will set over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different holes.
Discussions about the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs test, when he made a pair of Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles at the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish into a pit so deep that they weren't even nearly out of it.
Sunday, though, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and deserve to be followed by the interactions between pairs, the advice given and the way a strategy can be changed on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the incentive to continue fighting, which some, in particular the United States, doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after the fourballs and forsomes of Saturday with an advantage of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired pair composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two winners in front of a hesitation Tiger Woods, which has increased their score from so far to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes at the fourballs test in the morning and won the series with score 3 to 1.
The U.S. has opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome test, where it won two matches, but it has not been able to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 simple games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and along with Molinari, a pair called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair that wins four points of the four opening matches throughout the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs test, they supported themselves beautifully to defeat the discouraged Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambeau with a score even clearer, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two games on Saturday, had occasional genius eclipses, but so far lost 19 of the 29 matches to fourballs and forsomes, of which seven were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourball session, returned with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome test and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe did not, however, have a journey without obstacles on this pleasant and cool day in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the star for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2-1 match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs test, then they came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4 to 3 in the forsome test, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has managed a team to recover a four-point deficit in simple evidence, though, because they are current trophies holders, Furyk players only need an equal result.
However, after being on the second place two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea declares that there is no "no chance" to disarm unilaterally as long as there is no trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday the United Nations that extending the sanctions will deepen its mistrust in the United States and that it is impossible for its country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the Global Council that "significant measures have been implemented in North Korea to prove good faith" last year, such as halting nuclear tests and testing of rockets, demounting of nuclear testing and commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we see no adequate response from the United States,” he said.
"If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities and, under such circumstances, we can't disarm the first one."
Although Ri raised the family objections of North Korea to Washington’s opposite resistance to a “sustained” approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it step by step, its statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearisation, as did the Phenian in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in a first-person summit between a US-led president and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to making progress towards a "declaration of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea sought an official end to the Korean War in 1950-1953, but the United States stated that the Phenian must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not submitted requests for the relaxation of international sanctions imposed by North Korea.
"SUS insists on the "first denuclearisation" option and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even objecting to "the declaration of the conclusion of the war," Ri said.
“The impression that the sanctions can bow to us is an illusion that only people who do not know us.
But the problem is that the sanctions extend deeper our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, to which the US leader at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korea's president, for the past five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this gap."
Even under these circumstances, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he said for the UN General Assembly that it is inevitable to target the US territory with rockets in North Korea after the "Mother Evil President" Trump called Kim a "mocket-man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction," praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but pointed out that the work just began and that sanctions will remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there is no planned time for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it lasts two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the Phenian should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday for the UN Security Council: “The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without interruption until we get complete, final and confirmed denuclearisation.”
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed by North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for nuclear programmes and on the ballistic missiles of Phenian.
Pompeo met with Ri in the color of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit the Phenian again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit was not very good.
When he left Phenian in July, he said that progress had been made, but after only a few hours, North Korea denounced that he had made “gangsterist threats”.
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has undertaken to dismantle a rocket launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
He said that Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” that he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised them in Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest
A new course from Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat growing macho culture that makes them subject to “all night” learning sessions, which are fuelled with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that students at the most prestigious universities in the world often do not even possess the basic concepts of the way they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleeplessness on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came and said to me, ‘Why do I have this just been told in the last year?’
She told me she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said for The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance as well as the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after he discovered that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course may involve a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, the image of a home room is presented, and students can click on coffee meat, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
“We know we can’t change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
Culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, says it, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed by students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain believe that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after he took part in one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to be asked to complete a similar study programme before joining this institution where the competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for waking time, and to know what the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal takes down Gerard's team
Rangers suffers from another case of depression on the way because Dolly Menga's strike sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team on Ibox wanted to win the first victory on the move from the 4-1 triumphal in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as a coach, which puts Rangers with eight points behind Hearts, the authoritarian leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga signed up seven minutes before the break and uninspired Rangers players did not appear at any time to be equal.
Rangers thus fell on the sixth position in the ranking, while Livingston went up the third place, behind Hibernian, to a single goal difference.
And Rangers might also face other problems, because the Calim Spence coughing referee had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, apparently, thrown from the fan lawn of the visiting team.
Gerrard changed eight players from the lot that won easy against Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players at Livingstone who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has all the reasons to be proud of how his well-trained lot suffocated his opponents throughout the game.
Even though Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
It should have marked just two minutes after the game started, when Menga's first step pushed Scott Pittman to the gate defended by Allan McGregor, but the middle missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free shot by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
Rangers took over, but they left the impression that more hope than they trust their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he met Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but arbitrator Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers did only two hits on the gate in the first stop, but the former porter from Ibox, Liam Kelly, was not at all disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or by Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although livingstone's 34th minute gap did not respect the game trend, no one can deny that it was worth it either for the effort it put forward.
Again, Rangers have failed to prevent a deep center of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, which kept his calm and gave it to Menga, the one who finished with a simple hit.
Gerrard acted at pause, when he changed Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this movement almost paid off immediately, when extreme centred Morelos, but impressive Kelly came out of the barrels to block it.
But Livingston continued to lure visitors into exactly the same type of match he prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting the center after the center.
Holt's team could have extended their advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' hit, then Lithgow sent his head over the corner gate.
Glenn Middleton, reserved at Rangers, asked for a penalty at the end of the game, when he hit Jacobs, but again Thomson disagreed.
Almanah: the inventor of Count Geiger
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the CONTINUARY Count...), is the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, Count Geiger has become essential and for pop culture, as happened in the film "The Clopots of San Coronado" (1950), where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played in the role of cowboys with unlikely inclination to science:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these hats, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Yes, a lot of punches are heard.”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" and destroy harmful cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them into a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and then are reinjected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a common protein of many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “determines the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to target cancer cells, has also worked to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a Tromp supportive diatric, while wearing a MAGA cap, after appearing at SNL.
It didn't come out too well
Kanye West was robbed in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a disillusioned show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he intends to run for the 2020 elections.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Cape Make America Great, the artist disbanded in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I speak to a white person, I’m asking, ‘How can you like Trump?’
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began its show with a scene in which Matt Damon played, where the Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's Diatriba footage was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take West over with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems in the backseat because of his six.
“They tried to intimidate me in the backseat.
They said, "Don't wear this cap."
I've been assaulted!
They also told me we got very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see how far down we have?", then he said, “I’m gonna get Superman’s coat, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try with love."
His comments attracted public executions at least twice, and the members of the SNL team seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported; a person from this team said to the publication: “The studio has gained a complete silence.”
West was invited as a last-hour substitute for the soloist Ariana Grande, whose beloved rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West picked up a lot of eyebrows when I Love played it dressed as a glass of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits among us: Thank you for running the Gloata.”
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West, simply "was himself and that's wonderful."
"I therefore choose not to reward someone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") about which I believe he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he has changed his name, announcing that from now on it is "the official establishment known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known as Prince".
Indictment of attempted murder for a stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant on the east side of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defence lawyer is expected to be in front of the Court of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutions will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star in the Star of Thrones, attacks the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for Jon Snow's role in the series of violent medieval fantasy Throne Urzeal, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on screen makes the boys think it must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit told him that "something wrong happened" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague from the Throne Urzel, Rose Leslie, who is 31 years old, acknowledged that she is "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personal, I am very determined to talk about it now: where did I wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television could be partially responsible for increasing male toxicity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What does the young boys teach on TV and on the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the great questions of our times: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something has happened wrong with young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play any kind of series based on the Throne Urzeal after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that “it ended with the battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West Theatre by Sam Shepard, who presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thug.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of the Throne Urzeal series is that he knew his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I made this series, so it assured me the future of my family and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of several Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike those in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was almost zero, says the Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered very widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, the studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many cases of transmission of diseases stem from inappropriate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to drugs against HIV as part of the effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has released the data of the Republican Party Senators, talks about "dangerous beginnings" and "the theories of conspiracy"
The representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations on Saturday that a member of his team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges are made by analysts and "right extreme" websites.
"Minds, lies and other despicable lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
The disclosed information included the Senators' personal addresses and phone numbers. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on the charges of improper sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as judge in the Supreme Court.
The information leak took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and presented the information of a Waters team member, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“Member of the team, whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, has in no way been responsible for leaking such information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including the former White House Secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have the necessary temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
They shall not question the accuser’s motives.
You must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticised by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during the Tuesday hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in mid-term elections, also commented on Twitter.
“ Important, if it is true, ” he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had alerted “adequate authorities and legal entities to these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered,” she continued, “and that they will respond to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.”
Review Johnny English hits again: uncomplicated parody of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition of looking for some of Brexit's associated meanings in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the series of parodys of action movies that has as its main character Johnny English, the series that started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English returns.
Will this despising satire be able to become the nation's new opportunity of export by us?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with eyes staring and rubber face, was renewed for the second time the license to ruin everything. The name of the character, firstly, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematographic audience in the unspoken English-language countries.
He is, of course, the scrupulous secret agent who, despite his luxury and extravagance claims, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of that guy who contributed with a single note to the music theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
The character is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without a country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard commercials for TV, which left chaos behind.
This latest JE adventure also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor pallets hit his coif easily.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" movies, such as those of the 007 series or impossible Mission, confidently provide comical moments as an ingredient.
The mood seems to be addressing children more than adults and, for me, Johnny English's exciting adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's silent movie gags when he plays Bean's role.
As usual, the premise always is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the supersecret web network of Great Britain spies and revealed the identities of English agents undercover, toward the despair of the service agent, a regrettable role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who is under siege, who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can with his fellow character Theresa May, but the scenario does not give him the chance to shine.
Its secret intelligence advisors inform it that all active spies have been compromised, so they need to activate an agent in reserve.
This is Johnny English's own zenge, now working as a teacher in a high-class school, which also gives lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute holes, because English runs a spy academy in the school of Rock style.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency meeting, then is reunited with his old partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, the role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
Thus, these Batman and Robin are creating the messes in the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a billionaire charismatic of the technology industry that claims he can solve the IT problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start in a odyssey of bourgeois adventures: dressed in waiters, set a French fashion restaurant on fire, create chaos when they slip on board Volta's luxury ship, then English triggers purely shaped anarchies when they try to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, however, no matter how cute and colorful the film seems to be a television production for children.
A pretty mediocre film.
As with the other films with Johnny English, can't I stop asking myself: Can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role in terms of his talent?
Labourers deny that they have a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants company leaders to take advantage of possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) giving employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
Sources say that the idea would "be" with the party's economic programme, which wants to tilt balance in favour of workers.
The four-day workweek is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way by which workers can benefit from changing the economy.
A source from the Labour Party’s leadership said for The Sunday Times: “The policy review announcement is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an appropriate aspiration to address the economic rebalancing party in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall strategy of the industry party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 campaign for general elections.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The week of work for four days is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.”
The Lord Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that it is determined to take back the power from the "frontless directors" and "profiters" from the utility companies.
The plans of the cancel master of the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that current shareholders of the water-supplying regions may not recover their actions in full, because the Labour Government could perceive "deductions" due to proven offences.
It also confirmed plans to appoint employees in company boards and to create ownership funds to give up 10% of the private sector’s own capital to employees, which will thus receive annual dividends of up to about 500 lire.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the show "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh would make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought to Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court with at least a week's notice and raised the question whether Republican senators could be convinced to stop supporting him because of the FBI's findings.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I said this at the beginning of the hearing; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, soon, without error."
Graham's vote, however, appears to be dug in stone.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so there would be a need for some explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly rejects the charges," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ None of the people named by her confirmed the story.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something will change."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and has managed to do something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens' Festival, an annual musical event in which an impressive group of stars will participate, with an equally impressive mission: the elimination of global poverty.
Up to the seventh edition, the Global Citizens' Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park lawn, not only to pursue artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the true goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to pay for a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making telephone calls or other significant things that help increase the level of awareness of the goal of global poverty elimination.
But what success did the Global Citizens' Festival have when there are only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism", the concept that refers to people who feel they have done something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, in 2011 more than 19 million "actions" were recorded by its supporters, which promoted different objectives.
The organization says that these actions have spurred world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in the account of which at least $10 billion was already spent or tight.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with headquarters in the United Kingdom of investors and intermediaries who have committed to "help children grow to their full potential", which has promised to offer Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 messages on Twitter from global citizens.
"With the help of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition only become a footnote in the book of history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of the crowd during a live concert in London, in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance the project The Power of Nutrition, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights movements or anti-apartheids that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will play this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use naval forces for a "blocada" to make Russia's energy exports more difficult, says the Interior Secretary
Washington may, "if necessary", call on naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, unveiled US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermediate energy sales, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and ways to manage the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not come out on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declared itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the USA.
It continued to compare how Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is basically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia, "it's one trick" because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
Statements come at a time when Trump is trying to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this sense, Trump's representatives, including President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project of the Northern Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a Moscow "prisoner".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, at 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin said that US fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we are looking at things the same way: energy cannot be an instrument by which pressure is put and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Aleksandr Novak, Russia's energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state intervenes in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks seriously" to run at the presidential elections of 2020, says the senator in Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that he must "think seriously" if he is running for presidential elections after mid-term elections.
During the meeting in the City Hall of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that's what a strong woman needs," she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will think seriously about running presidential elections.”
Warren had something to say about President Donald Trump during the meeting at the city hall, saying that he “turned the country in the wrong direction”.
"I'm deeply worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate appointed by him for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that no majority of Warren's voters think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% are against it.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said that he would decide officially until January, he reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress syndrome that Track Palin is suffering at a Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case
“The things that my own son is going through, through which he has gone back... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of posttraumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the injuries that our soldiers return with,” Donald Trump told the public gathered at a rally of support for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "returned a little different, harder, wondering if there was any respect for what they and their soldiers from the armed and air forces, as well as all other members of the army, did for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence and holding a firearm in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, the spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Columbia District contests a new asylum application policy
Eighteen states and Columbia District support a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who attempt to escape violence caused by gangs or domestic violence.
18-State and District representatives have completed a friendly request for curiae in Washington on Friday to support a challenge to the asylum policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy was not revealed.
It said that her partner “and his violent sons, members of a gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was held in Texas.
The state lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing a generalized problem with the host and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled a 2014 decision of the Council for Immigrant Appeals which allowed immigrants without acts to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
“Federal law states that all asylum applications should be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle,” writes friendly curiae.
In addition, lawyers argue in demand that the policy refusing the entry of immigrants affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour force.
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, in June, ordered judges for immigration cases not to grant asylum to victims trying to escape abuse and violence of the gangs.
“The asylum is granted to those who leave the country motivated by persecution or fear because of racial discrimination, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on 11 June when he announced the policy.
The role of asylum has never been that of solving all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a race against timer to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is akin to her baby suffering from fever at an evacuation center in the city destroyed Palu.
“The ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
The residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were overcome by the situation.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous replications.
He has tears in his eyes when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“ We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris said for Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, then only silence.
I don't know what happened to her and to my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "infringing" of "propaganda claims"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda material.
US President Donald Trump referred Wednesday to China's supplement to Des Moines Register, the best seller of Iowa's newspaper, after accusing China of mixing in the 6 November elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The charge that Beijing is trying to mix in the U.S. elections marked what US officials said for Reuters that it is a new phase in a Washington escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements in which trade is promoted, Beijing and Washington are currently locked up in a growing trade war involving import tariff increases.
The charges imposed by China as revenge, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, experts from China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and business people.
In an editorial published on Sunday in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“When propaganda spreads through the publication of a commercial in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of free speech and free press in America,” writes Branstad.
“On the other hand, at the newspaper stop on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of the dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say what paper it was about.
Republicans alienate female voters before mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh scandal, warns analysts
As many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warned that there would be a counter-reaction, especially from women, during future mid-term elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and most of the Republicans who talked publicly about it intend to continue the vote.
"So the reactions won't be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute (Arison's representative) initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and will not look in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman of the progressive group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors scanned "Come November!" while demonstrating in the Senate halls when Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite testimony Dr. Christine Blasey Ford reported Mic.
"Enthusiasm and the motivation of the Democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who does not share the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the indecisive female voters of the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the sexual abuse charges brought to the Supreme Court by the nominee, the analysts suggested that it might follow a counter-reaction if the Republicans continued the confirmation process.
"This has become an issue for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee's vote or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh will be confirmed, but also how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the USA Priorities, an electoral support group for the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part that should be believed after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seems to believe him later.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe Ford's testimony is likely to be true, while 35% said they strongly believe it or it's likely that Kavanaugh's testimony is true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore to the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh abused her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominationist at the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs to her face when they were attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt is "global dominance".
“Now we have to do it,” he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data archive" or PODs.
It may contain lists of contacts, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all at once.
What's unique about this personal data archive online is that the user has full control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal consolidation by data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt contributes with adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely overrun.
"We do not ask for permission."
In a post published on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even after Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergy who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War is celebrated
The only cleric of the Anglican Church who won a Victoria Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had been awarded the highest military honor of Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said he was “skinned with symbolicness ” that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "into a very dense fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the first line and, with "a fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then alone attacked a artillery nest and managed to eliminate three of the weapons of the detachment.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “one thing I know I will never be able to match, but that makes me feel humiliated.”
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given to a lot of people."
The MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, but they got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you stayed awake all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just to be unable to follow the main event.
The program of the San Jose event contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, British spectators were amazed when the transmission was replaced with an episode from Peppa Pig.
Some weren't happy at all, because they stayed awake all night to watch the fight.
One fan described Twitter as moving to the cartoon for children as "a sort of bad joke."
“Governmental regulations say that this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Porcupine, yes."
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator's company, said that in the future, they're going to program their events so that they can also be followed by spectators in Britain.
“When I think about replay, I think we could probably work it out, ” said Coker.
"But it's six a.m. on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do this until Sunday, our time, or months, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
We will sum up to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give fans more and we crossed the line.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sexuality
Olympic scumbag Tom Daley says he's grown up feeling he's inferior because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he only realized when he got to school that "not everyone is like me."
Invited to the first broadcast Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he talks about the rights of gay people to give them "hope".
The sportsman also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the traditional release, will be missing a few months due to a disease.
Invited in the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "lower" to others because "it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls."
He said: “These feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different have so far been the real things that have given me the strength and strength to gain success.”
He wanted to prove himself “someone,” he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics became a renowned champion of the LGBT campaigns and took advantage of the appearance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to call on several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live free, without pursuit, and because he wanted to give to others "hope".
The World Champion's Triple said it was "surprisingly caught up" by the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year to the winner of the Oscar Prize, which is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age, ” he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who had gone through the same good and bad times.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, says Daley, changed his whole perspective.
“If I had been asked last year, I would only have been interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if he had received tickets for the London Olympic Games in 2012, because he wanted to be in the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you won’t be first, Dad’,” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and barely after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that at this I had dreamed of a whole life, to jump in front of my country’s spectators at the Olympic Games, there is no more beautiful feeling,” he said.
This inspired him in the chosen music, Proud of Heather Small, songs that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excited him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Micchelson, out of shape, was passed to the reserve bank on Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Miccelson will set up a record on Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seventh game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to return to a good shape so that it will not be an unfortunate occasion.
Micchelson, who plays in the biennial event to twelve, another record, was passed on to the reserve bank of Captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and forsomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has often been for the United States team, the twenty-first major tournament winner shared the day between being major for teammates and exerting his blows, hoping that he will correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player never had the rightest drives, not even in the best time of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow land at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish incorrect hits.
And if the land isn't a big enough challenge, in the ninth Mickelson Sunday game, he's going to face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who has allied himself with the novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Miccelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for Americans, driven four points at the entrance to the 12 simple games, which must begin forcefully at this stage.
Furyk was confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't say anything else anyway.
“He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on my shoulder, hugged me, and told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he was gonna play in two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened, and that's how I thought we had to proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Sunday, Micchelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never rose to his personal record.
Miccelson has 18 winning matches, 20 lost and seven half, although Furyk said his presence had brought some intangible advantages to the team.
“It’s funny, it’s sarcastic, it’s smart, it’s a joke with players, it’s a wonderful guy in the team locker,” he explained.
“I think young players are having fun with him, it was fun seeing him do that during the week.
Its role is more important, not just to play."
Captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple evidence in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
Danez debuted in the 1997 Valderrama game, when the team led by Captain Sever Ballesteros drove the Americans five points, but only if he managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 1411⁄2 to 1311⁄2.
“I remind myself that I had a considerable advance at Valderrama; I had a big advance and at Brookline, where I lost, and at Valderrama, where I barely managed to win,” Bjorn said (image) after he followed up with the 2018 team, who won with 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now runs with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
“So, history shows me, me and my team, that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let's get out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are passed on the table.
We have a purpose and this is to win this trophy, it has to remain the goal.
We always said, we need to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know and what we expect on the other side: the best players in the world."
Bjorn added: “I am not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow's a whole different situation.
Individual performances are important tomorrow, and this is different.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to maximum, as a golfer.
This is the message that you have to transmit to players, that must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opposing team, hopes his players will play better at simple proof than they did with partners except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such a return on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing one when Europe managed the "Miracle of Medina".
"Remember every word," he answered when asked how the 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw succeeded in encouraging his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like Brookline, like Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, put a lot of pressure on those mid-games.
We created the proper lot and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was set to lead the fight: he will face Rory McIllroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
“I chose this group of players in this order, because I believe it covers all the subjects,” Bjorn said about the lot for simple proof.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The latest fleet of German naval forces should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the old war vessels in the Cold War, but this will only happen in the year, due to defective systems and growing costs, the local press reported.
The operation of the Rheinland-Pfalz vessel, the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate ship, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, who reads a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to be introduced into maritime forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Military Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is assumed that they will be provided with a strong cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vase rockets, as well as with stealth technologies, which provides a low radar, infrared and acoustic print.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to be able to leave on missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, the continued delays mean that these warships of the last generation, about which they are said to increase the maritime force of Germany, will already be aged before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
F125 friar chaplain was discussed last year when the German Military Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Not much information is available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media quoted a number of crucial "software and hardware" that would have made the warship useless on a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crew on the oldest frigates in the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been shown that the vessel has a much too heavy weight, which has reduced its performance and limited the capacity of the Military Navy to add future skills.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as difficult as the German vessels used in the Second World War.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, and the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an amazing figure of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the original price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates end up with special importance given the latest warnings that say German maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Committee, acknowledged that the Military Navy “has begun to remain without vessels that can be sent on missions.”
The officer said that the problem has steadily increased over time, because the old vessels have been removed without being replaced with new ones.
It deplored the fact that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class went into operation within the Military Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New researches that are carried out on a Scottish Highlands property want to reveal how the bats use the surrounding environment to hunt down their prey.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these unprecedented flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will analyze common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as ear bats and water bats from Invewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be located in key places around the property to track the activity of bats during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using manual detectors.
The specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and what species emit certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of habitat and a report, to create a detailed, scaled picture of their environmental behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used for each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grassland, and which is the best way to maintain forest forests for bats and other associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are the traps for flies and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also the attacks of domestic cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated echo technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, thinks very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, control nests and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization even created the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland, on the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of ten species of bats in Scotland are found.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here at Thrave, the area is wonderful for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need them to multiply."
It emphasises the importance of looking for bats before carrying out maintenance work on properties, because simply unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chickens, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected, and killing, harassment or harassment, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the audience to help them.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species. ”
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "will advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
Portugal's attacker and the Juventus team were accused of violating a woman in America, identified as Kathryn Majorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the Winner of the Golden Balloon in front of the video room.
“I want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous by using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of these charges, which they have called "an inadmissible report of private suspicions", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player will seek compensation for “moral damage equivalent to an adequate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed at the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell down on his knees and told him that he was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "a percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
The Mayor claims that he addressed the police and that his photographs of his injuries were made at the hospital, but later he accepted a deal outside the courtroom because he was "sterified by the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that "he would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now looking to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian Giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "would regret forever" Loss of Auto Producers
Britain would "sorry forever" if it lost world leader status in the production of cars after Brexit, said Secretary for Business Greg Clark.
He added that it is "anxiety" that Toyota UK has said to BBC that, if Britain will come out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory at Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis brands of Toyota are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they were afraid of coming out of the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, he will close the Oxford factory where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a Brexit with no agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on the "fix time" principle: for cars manufactured at the command, the pieces arrive at 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there might be problems on the border, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than the inventory for one day at his Derbyshire factory, says the company, so the production would have stopped.
Clark said the May Theresa’s Chequers plan for future EU relations is “precisely balanced to avoid these delays at the border”.
“There must be an agreement. We want to have the best deal, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said for the BBC Radio 4 show.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other producers shows that we must continue to use what was a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota was unable to specify how long production will have to be stopped, but warned that higher prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the long-term factory and eventually lead to job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who works in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: “Experience has taught me that when these jobs are gone, these jobs do not return.”
A government spokesman said: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "due another week", because the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, the one who investigates Russian interference in elections, the links between Trump's and Russia's aid and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
The rumors about Trump's firing the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, have been circulating in circles in Washington for months.
Early in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and the reports claim he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he would "want not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's legal commission, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked for a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which he postponed, again, the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “Even though it has not been established once, it may be this week or may be delayed for a week, taking into account all the other things now happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would argue: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on September 10.
Gazda Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by the antipathy to TV reporters who like to show, although he added: “I don’t deny that they like to show.”
Then he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president participates in more questions and answers than all previous presidents,” she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: “I have analyzed the figures.”
"There will be briefings," Sanders said, but "it seems much better that the press have the opportunity to ask the questions directly to the president of the United States, not to me.
We're trying to do this most of the time and you could notice that we've done this many times in the past few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with his visitors.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this happens, with an improvised appearance, on bizarre locations, in front of the assembled reporters.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health is addressed in a letter to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on the issues related to Brexit
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of Parliament in Scotland, sent the letter under the conditions under which there are less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs for requests to receive permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be taken this fall.
But the United Kingdom government began to prepare more and more for a different scenario, where there would be no EU exit agreement.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I wish to reiterate how much I appreciate each employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Colleges in the European Union, but also outside it, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service and also bring benefits to patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is subjected to emergency surgery after having suffered a head strike
The founder of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to emergency surgery after he suffered a head shot on Saturday, in the game that his team lost in front of Vanderbilt Commodoros team, with score 31-27, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The main coach of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
“He got to the cough line and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by physical trainers and medical personnel, on the cough line, before sitting on a tart and transporting it out of the field for a thorough assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie came out of the operation he was subjected to at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/exploitation of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a student in the year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, it managed to make five total plaques before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 plaques throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp court tax on the purchase of a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp court tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom, following that additional money is used for helping homeless people, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
The court rate will be applied to persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury is expected to collect up to 120 million pounds per year for the assistance of homeless people
Foreign buyers will apply a higher stamp tax rate to purchase a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as is to be announced today Theresa May.
The change will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising homes with more advantageous prices and targeting people with high incomes.
The higher court rate will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the efforts of the Government to help the homeless.
Suprataxa, which is added to the current court rate of stamp, including the high levels two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for the purpose of rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The treasure is expected to bring an increase of up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks since Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies that they maintain high prices on property as a result of the purchase of land without using them and asked Theresa May to drop taxes on affordable houses in order to solve the "house problem" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a number of proposals for attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the cessation of self-evident evacuations.
He also wishes to give the Councils greater powers in the construction of new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my first mandate to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And this means solving the problems that exist in the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with seats abroad, can buy houses as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become much too distant, and living in undemned conditions is far too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be the manager of the national team of Scotland"
Jack Ross, Sunderland’s football team manager, said that his final goal is to become, at some point, the national team manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotch enjoys the challenge of "reviving" the north-eastern club, which is currently 3rd in the First League, with a difference of three points from the first place.
He moved this summer to the team on the Stadium of the Light after last season, the return of St. Mirren's football team in the first Scottish Premiership division.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got to the B team of the nationals and that's it," Ross said for Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood chasing the Scottish matches at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I'll have this opportunity only if I'm successful as club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors, as managers of the Sunderland club, are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager of the Alloa Athletic club said he had no emotions to be the successor of such consecrated names and to such an important club after he refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that concerns me and that could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team return to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to Premier League."
Ross has only three years of experience in management, after a period during which he was an assistant manager in Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the Alloa club come back after he regraded in Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from retrograde, helping the team win the championship title next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking over the lead of the Alloa club.
“I really thought I was more of a manager than a player.
Maybe it sounds weird, 'cause we had a good time, we got a good win and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I'm dealing with similar situations as a manager, with regard to stress and pressure, but I feel it's the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do this, I feel like it's the best thing I've ever got in my whole adult life."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30, from 12:00 to 13:00 at the Radio Scotland Sportsound show.
The ideal time to drink a beer bell is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey
The heat in this summer has led to an increase in revenue in the UK pubs, but putting more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
According to figures, pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the revenues of the restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the representative of the CGA that provides business consultancy services and that carried out the survey, said: “Constant heat and England’s participation in the World Cup for a longer period than expected contributed to a printing in July, similar to the previous month, when pubs registered with up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a shorter period.
The number of customers smaller than 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June has declined further in July.
Pubs and bars serving drinks only recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food have experienced heat losses, but not as large as those of the restaurants.
It seems that people went out to town just to consume drinks.
The sales of drinks at all bars and pubs have increased by 6.6% this month, and the food has dropped by 3%."
Paul Newman, the representative of the RSM that provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of sporting and social events of scale remain among the most important factors contributing to OOH sales associated with advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decrease in sales by 4.8% per year will be added to current cost pressures.
Long summer cancicular could not come at a worse time for food business operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the low number of new locations launched.
The company that monitors sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds, which is the official industrial standard.
One of five children has a secret account on a social network that is hiding from parents
According to a survey, one out of five children, some even up to 11 years old, have a secret account on a social network that hides from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 gymnasium students revealed an increase in "false Insta" accounts
Knowledge has increased the fear of sexual content posts
20% of students said they had a "primary" account showing their parents
One of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a social network that keeps them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 gymnasium students revealed a rapid increase in “instal fake” accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowledge has increased the fear of sexual content posts.
20% of students said they had a "principal" and "clean" account that their parents were showing, but they also had other private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, noticed a teen's post that asked to be "violated".
According to research carried out by the Digital Awareness company in the United Kingdom and the directory association (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 years have two profiles, and half of them have recognized that they own secret accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers do not have access.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Commission of the Scots
Eilidh Doyle was elected as Director, without Executive Power, of the Commission of the Athletes in Scotland, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field athlete and track in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie has described the change as a great opportunity for those making decisions on sports to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes in Scotland, Great Britain, as well as throughout the world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with his inclusion in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle also said: “I am pleased that I will be able to represent athletes and hope to have a real contribution and can help with sport activities in Scotland.”
Atleta of American Nationality, who won 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator at BBC, remained invalid after he suffered a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide whether or not I will recover.
It was a titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go again, and today I do exercises of agility!
Thank you for your encouragement messages!"
A breast pump advertising that compares women with cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A breast pumping company has caused the division of public opinion in the online environment to a commercial comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be “the first silent and portable breast pump in the world,” the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic commercial, inspired by a music video, to present the freedom that the new pump offers to breast-feeding mothers.
Four true mothers dance in a barn full of cows hay on a song that includes such verses as: “Yes, I thank you, but I have no tail” and “if you have not noticed, they are not weasel, but my breasts.”
The cooler continues: “I pump, pump, breast feeding, pump, pump, pump, extract milk from girls.”
However, the complaint, published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them saying that it is out of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and give birth to milk, except that they are stolen from their children only a few days after birth," wrote one person.

Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Others added: “A highly inappropriate commercial.”
Other people defended the commercial, a person claiming to have looked like a "hilarious" commercial.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if we were still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a cow.
The claim is a little inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is great," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun commercial for mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like “good luck”.
It's not a commercial that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with discreet pumps inserted into bras.
The concept that lies at the base of the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like the guts.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the possibility of holding their children in arms and even getting out of town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and developer in Mother’s design, commented: “Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump and challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
This is not the first time Elvie pump gets on the front page.
During the presentation of the fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been transferred to a refugee camp at the border with Texas.
The number of detained migrant children increased, although the number of people who passed the border each month remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration caused the difficulty of placing children in sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and fear they will endanger their stay in the country if they ask to take children.
Risks increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must record their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the customs and immigration authority (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), said to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we're gonna keep looking for that guy," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing in the children’s system, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children must appear in court within one month of detention, and not at 60 days as provided for in the previous standard, according to the employees of the shelters.
Many will plead for the case through a video call, and not personally before an immigration judge, to apply for the status of legal resident.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more they can become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to the employees of the shelters and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are accentuated in a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that the signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed, because of the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria calls for American, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the interim prime minister, said that foreign military forces are on an illegal Syrian territory, under the pretext of countering terrorism and that “the situation will be managed appropriately”.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any condition," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been destroyed from their homes.
He also said Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.”
In Syria, there are about 2,000 military troops in the United States, which deal in particular with the training and advice of Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
Also, there are more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Moualem said that there are favourable conditions for their return and accused “a few Western countries” of “the spread of irrational fears”, which led refugees to keep their distance.
He added: "I have called for the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return."
"Political influences have been brought into a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there will be a political agreement between Assad and the war opposition.
The United Nations Diplomacy states that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to evict the last group of rebels created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has contributed to the avoidance of a large assault by Syrian forces, supported by Russian forces, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has “clear limit terms” and expressed his hope that military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which “should be eradicated”.
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations emissar, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee formed by the members of the government and the opposition to the drafting of a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the ground for elections.
Moulem presented the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, stating that the Committee's activities should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning on interference.
Why Will Trump Win the Second Term?
If we follow this logic, Trump will be back in 2020, unless the removal procedure or the scandals will end his presidency's mandate earlier, which most of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would be, without any doubt, “the most dramatic end of a president's term of office of all time.”
Until now, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, the first-time audiences have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the prime time, Fox News television station is followed on average by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast recorded a record of hearing, with 3.5 million people who followed it in the evenings when important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's dramatic "Reservation President" series, about a cabinet secretary who is president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with a vast field experience and authoring "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why did she ask.
“He said, “Because he makes me laugh,” Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be complete and about the state of the global economy.
Changing the post is a luxury that can only allow the privileged audience.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you reach the sixth hour of vision of the debate by an expert committee of how Bob Woodward uses deep background sources for his book, "Fear", on Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather jacket ("an opulent garment", according to The Washington Post) and the shocking implications of Stormy Daniels actress's "Anatomical Party" of Trump.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"A large part of what makes you feel like watching a reality show and feeding you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment Media Group and the creator of the "Asi Ammadet" show, on the distribution constantly changed and the changes in the daily situation caused by Trump (the launch of a story with the American football professional League, the praises brought to Kim Jong-Un).
You're not allowed to miss an episode, because you're gonna feel like you're staying behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his home on the northern coast of the island of Kaau, out there were 27 degrees and there was sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording on CNN.
It could not be released from the front of the television, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate's legal commission and the future Supreme Court was to be decided.
“I remember making some shows out of common in the past, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right.”

Overcoming external financial resources for the narrowest intermediate choices associated with the Chamber of Representatives
As a result of a reinstatement of the electoral districts, of which two holders of the mandate have resulted in an electoral race for the same function, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburg has run the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the special elections in another district last spring.
Lamb is running against another in-service mandate holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th electoral district, which overlaps significantly with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, being manipulated the boundaries of the districts in favour of the republicans.
The new 17th electoral district has launched a competition to finance campaigns between important party funding bodies, the Congress Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in special elections, of the highest audience, which took place in March for Pennsylvania's 18th electoral district.
For over a decade the function had been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, Democrats enjoy an easy advantage.
The United States took into account the penalisation of the State of El Salvador because of its agreement with China, but then gave up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the president of the Panamanian Republic, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization’s leadership team.
The State Department officials have decided to call the heads of the US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of the "new decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert said, the department's spokesman in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions were taken against the State of El Salvador, which received US aid of approximately $140 million in 2017, including for the control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country of Central America and the high rate of unemployment and crimes in Central America.
As internal meetings have made progress, officials from North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference, focused on security and economic prosperity, in order to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials clearly showed that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any examination of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned for Vice-President Mike Pence to address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance that the administration grants to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports were co-ordinated by an external analyst, who is a close friend to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of maintaining the anonymity.
History Study
The next thing that might happen is the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
Mueller also seems to focus on his investigation and on investigating the existence of a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia as regards the attack on American elections.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due responsibility within the body, even when it is prepared to appear before the voters and may possibly be a jury of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, which is also valid for his European counterparts.
There are choices that we have to make on the one hand and on the other in the Atlantic that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to give a coup against Hitler, only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
I failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing some of these critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump resigns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year suggested the secret registration of the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times newspaper's story is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigations concerning Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and lying testimony?
And above all, will we vote for the intermediate elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson I learned at Prague.
My mother was a Jewish from Czech-Slovak origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday candles on the table with tufts.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans player from Rangers team is optimistic about the fast Vienna game
On Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian match, after the impressive match in Spain against the Villarreal team from the beginning of the month, will place it on a strong position to qualify as the Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow the middle Graham Dorrans to play this season until equal to 2-2 with Villarreal, but it considers that the Rangers team can use this result in its advantage to achieve better performances.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player said.
“We started the game thinking we’d get a good result and we won a point.
Maybe we could have signed up at the end, but overall, I think the tie was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first round, and we've noticed better in the second.
Thursday, it will be a very important night for Europe again.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game. However, having support supporters, we will certainly feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and club changes, but the situation is better right now.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; the training also goes well.
Let us hope that we will persevere, that we will leave the last season behind and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnia because of retirement savings
Despite the fact that polling participants knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the study carried out by the Nationwide company said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their husband/brother.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about this.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t start this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your husband/wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide the care you need if you do not make your wishes known over time.
Work with the counselor and with the family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Involve your financial adviser: and the financial adviser may be of real help in paying such expenditure.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can ensure your own welfare – to the extent you have the money.
Set up legal documents: come to the face of legal issues.
Get a power over medical decisions, to designate a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Also consider exercising authority over your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not just about the financial side. Can you tell me who the doctors are dealing with it,” Martin asked.
“What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Draft a plan on all these things."
A man was shot several times with an air gun compressed in Ilfracombe
One man was shot several times with a compressed air gun while going home after a night spent in the city.
Victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 p.m., as “accident shootings”.
The victim failed to see his attacker.
The wounds suffered did not put his life in danger, and the police called on witnesses to make statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the town of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase.
Due to the interruption of communications networks, disaster management authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Dogalaka region, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after disaster production.
Here are a few key information about Palu and Dogula, from the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the center of the island of Sulawesi, which lies at the end of a narrow golf course on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunami and earthquake.
Domalaka is a regency that stretches over a coast with a surface of over 300 km in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Region, an administrative region located below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fish and farming activities are the central point of the province's economy in the center of the island of Sulawesi, in particular the Domanga coast region.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Agency for Disaster Management in Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Also, in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Dogiana, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have taken place in recent years:

Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29 years old, in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and in opposition to the arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the police in Alaska State.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to sue for alleged offences, she took her phone.
Palin is in police custody at Mat-Su unit, waiting for the process, and is held on the basis of a security-free cage, worth $500, according to KTUU.
It was presented on Saturday in court, where it was declared “100% innocent” when requested by the network.
Palin is facing three charges of Class A crimes, which means that he could be imprisoned for up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been brought such charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce alleged aggression.
The case is under trial at the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, involving a complaint of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon while being drunk about an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after being part of the Iraqi military forces.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred outside the central Sulawesi province, located in the north-eastern Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Socialization networks circulate videos presenting the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The Federal Prosecutor wishes the capital punishment for the terrorist suspect in New York City
The New York Federal Prosecutor wishes the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City, after which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that was no longer applied in the state for a federal offense since 1953.
It seems that Saipov, aged 30, used a truck rented Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike track on the lower Manhattan West Side highway, hitting pedestrians and bikers on his path in October.
In order to justify the capital punishment, the prosecutor must prove that Saipov had “intendedly killed” the eight victims and caused “intendedly” serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent on requesting the capital punishment, filed in the South District of New York.
Both counts may receive a capital sentence, according to the court's document.
A few weeks after the attack, a major federal jury accused Saipov of 22 charges including eight criminal charges in support of the organized crime, usually used by the federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," the prosecutor said, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "greed, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, sufferings and losses for the following families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the South District of New York.
The stone, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers, but finally he was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted under the conspiracy charge of committing spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents in the court, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months after the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that he was pleased with what he did, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt inspired to execute the attack after he looked at the ISIS group videos on his phone, according to the requisitioner.
Also, according to the police, he asked to store the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded innocent with regard to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defenders in the office who represented Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence sentence, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the associated trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the capital punishment.
A member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party maintains that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Euroceptians, following a statement by a member of the Theresa May Parliament who suggested that it should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, Member of the Conservative Party, told a Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom would "come out" so far if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
However, the challenge that May faces with regard to the extremely divided camps was emphasized by members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against the exit of the European Union in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying out of power as his compromise plan, so-called the Chequers plan, to carry out properly, facing attacks on those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as on the European Union.
The Allies stressed that she would continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, no matter what the consequences, and will force the Euro-Cceptians and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and ‘chaos’.
Bone said in the Pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wants "renunciation to the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were led by him, I was no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of Wellingborough, added: “I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “I have not fought in the world war to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied the suggestions on the change of public opinion in the 2016 vote: "It is not true that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports the Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the voices of people.
"The public disagrees with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party disagrees with him and our activists who go out on the street and who support us, firstly, the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message to Theresa May, he added: “Ministers who keep their duties are the ones who respect their promises.”
In the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to “feel the pressure” if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
“Try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that “we will not let them do this.”
In a message to enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civil army of the country that has brought us victory to Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support the European Union have marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A small group of activists raised banners that the Conservative Party wrote against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for digitizing customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring any benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider running the presidency after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the Massachusetts Democrat Senatorate spoke on Saturday about her future during a mayor's meeting in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running to be re-elected at the November elections against Geoff Diehl, member of the House of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could beat Trump by 2020.
The afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with the right-to-voting citizens using the mayor's office since Trump took the position of president.
A participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for “women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government and this includes that in its head there is a woman.”
A suspect was arrested in the event of death that caused the death of the player Sims from the LSU team
Baton Rouge Police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the event of death that caused the death of the basketball player Wayde Sims from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police department announced Dyteon Simpson's arrest at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material with the time of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying the man in the picture.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the spot, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, 10 times in the original lot in the last season and played, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoverys on the game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team will have an essential role in the race.
Finding his first position in the ranking, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position on the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and leave Hamilton at the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped on the box later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to move forward after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inside free after he made a double move to defend himself at the third turn.
Max Verstappen began the race in the rear row of the carnation and was on the 7th place near the end of the first tour, even on the day he was 21 years old.
Then he was in the lead for a large part of the race, looking at a quick finish and trying to overcome Kimi Raikkonen and take place four.
Finally, he stopped on the box at the round number 44, but he couldn't step up in the last eight tours, Raikkonen remaining on the fourth.
“It was a difficult day. Valteri did an exceptional job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman, letting me go through the front.
And the team did an excellent job to get victory in front of Ferrari and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A Tragic Body Language
President Donald Trump hijacked the senatorate Diane Feinstein on Saturday, in a rally on the subject of his insistence that she did not facilitate the "shortening" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault at the Supreme Court.
Speaking in a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, stating instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "wrong, immoral and liars".
“The only thing that could happen is the nice thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and immoral and liars,” he said.
“When you see that they published and leaked information and then they say they didn’t.
They're not responsible.
Remember?
When did I ask her if she made it easier for the document to leak?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..poftim?
Oh, no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, I didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "scurred" in September, but Feinstein denied that "scurry" occurred from her office.
“I haven’t hidden the accusations that look at Ford and I’m not the one that has made it easier to “severe” her story,” Feinstein said to the committee, according to the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality and that's exactly what I did."
But her denial did not seem to have been well for the president, who commented during the Saturday rally: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the most terrible body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use charges to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Notice the wickedness, immorality, don't care who they hurt and who they need to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said, according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee's Stars team wins with 5-3 in front of Belfast Giants team
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against the Dundee team
Dundee's Star team paid for the Friday loss of the League of Elites, winning in front of Belfast Giants team in the back game on Saturday, with the 5-3 score in Dundee.
The Giants team had an advance of two goals, the hits being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer brought Giants back to the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard matched the Dundee score before two goals marked by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to ensure their victory.
It was the third defeat in the League of Elites this season for the players of Adam Keefe, who had recovered land defeating the Dundee team on 2-1 Friday evening.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening show took place in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from a pass of Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the benefit of the team four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan brought the host team back in the game in the minute 13:10, before Matt Marquardt offered him the opportunity to sign up for a score equal in the minute 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants team before the first break, when he enrolled his second goal at the end of the first shot.
The host team regrouped, and Bouchard rematched with an impressive goal again in the minute 27:37.
Later, in the second round, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen get an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that game, thus ensuring the team's climb to place 5 in the ranking, half of the last shot.
The Giants team, who has now lost four of the last five games, will be, on Friday, host for Milton Keynes in their next match.
An air traffic controller died after ensuring the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered to be a hero, dying after ensuring the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a strong earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong appeals in the area and many people are stuck under the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grande refused to leave his post at the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was shaking heavily.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the track at that time, will take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was about to crash.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian air navigation service provider stated that it is possible that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached the tree.
"We are distressed by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, the national disaster management agency saying that access is limited in the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
“We believe the number will increase, because many victims are still in ruins and we have not had access to many of these,” agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The valleys with a height of up to six metres devastated the city of Palu, and on Sunday there was a joint funeral.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
A 35 - year - old mother named Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minimarkets are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said for CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to offer help to survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the national army: “Please work day and night to accomplish all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" announced CNN.
Indonesia was shaken at the beginning of this year's earthquake in Lombok, who fought more than 550 dead.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now said that a person was missing, after earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that a male passenger is missing from the afternoon of Saturday.
He also mentioned that he was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The United States Air Company and Naval Forces said the plane missed the runway and arrived in a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe the plane has crossed the end of the track.
U.S. Nationality Passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the river, and to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the shipmates panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. naval forces said that the sailors working nearby for the renewal of a landing jump in help, using a inflatable boat to transport people on the shore before the aircraft sinks 30 metres below water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents of some airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them have included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents a history of nights when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed its pleading with regard to the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used his mobile phone records to lead Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, as well as his victim Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received tracking data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night he was killed, this being in contradiction with his earlier claims, according to Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and confessed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he “lyed, because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsequence was that Telllis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile records indicate that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
According to the time, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: what is conscious hip-hop?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way that this kind of music is seen, using positive messages songs.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social issues, as it initially did.
They want to return to their origins and make hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A nanny from New York sues a couple for firing her after it received a "rasist" text message
A nanny in New York sues a couple for firing for discriminatory reasons after she had, by mistake, received a text message from her mother, complaining that she was “a still colored person”.
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that she sued them for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed his dissatisfaction when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, is colourful when she showed up on the first day of work in 2016.
“NUUUUUUUUUU, IN A CULATION PERSON,” Pasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the gaffe, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, did not fulfill her duties properly and that she was expected to receive a babysitter of Filipino nationality, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day's work and sent home with Uber.
She now sues the couple to pay for the dismissal and seeks the amount of $350 a day for six months, the period when she was to live with them and work, despite the fact that this was done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that no such thing is done," she said Friday for the Post newspaper, adding "I know it's about discrimination."
The couple denied the claim that they were racists, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent her a wrong message.
She's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, her husband, for the Post newspaper.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have been wrong about, even if by mistake?
Newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process a “extrusion” action, Plasco said that his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Do you really want to take revenge on someone under such circumstances?
Don't do that," the bank investor added.
While the process is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple of socializing networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they have shown.
The publishers of Paddington's story were afraid that readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It's very funny now, after I saw Paddington had a huge success."
It further stated that his father, who was a chamberman for BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the anniversary at the time of the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was a "dulce-amruie" after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride about the success he later enjoyed.
"He was quite a quiet man and he didn't like to brag," she said.
“Well, because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, though it’s not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Though his creation was based on his imagination, he always used to give his credit to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye through the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
“It doesn’t sound often to tell me it’s very serious and you don’t think it’s going to survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me he'll die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, “Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines administered by doctors for her heart to continue to pump blood began to decrease and come out of her body.
She died a little while ago and the organs began to stop working.
I've been forced to sit there and wait, aware of everything that's going on.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, being in mourning after his daughter's death, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears kept flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight we had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy with the Nad.
I realized I needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two grieving women place different messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place several messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them being motivational and including phone numbers where people can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, age 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a soft smile.
“Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile changes your disposition."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had reached a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he had taken his life.
Davis said: “I keep thinking you will have a domino effect.”
This created the messages “to pass on to people that they may call on someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend. ”
Outside, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies's oldest friend, lost Mark, the life partner he was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and didn't even look in their eyes."
She said that her death was an immense trauma to them, but she must overcome it: “It caused great pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake, following the initiation of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for – an investigation over a limited period of time and a small scale – we could have little unity,” said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the commission was about to “disintegrate” on the basis of a partisan blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republicans want an FBI investigation?
Their retention is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6th elections - if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one who they wish to win at the highest court elections in the country will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush kept calling the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through which he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finishes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make the difference in the case of equality and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives in North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean parliamentman said.
Park Byeong-seug, reading data from the South Korean unification ministry, said last year they fled the country about 1,127 people, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were controls at the stricter border between North Korea and China and the higher rates perceived by those who illegally transport people across the border.
The Phenian did not make any public comment.
In the end, a vast majority of the fugitives from the north are given South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers fugitives rather illegal migrants than refugees and often returns forced.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still, practically, in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for a few discussions that had been the subject of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused that the United States sanctions have caused the lack of progress ever since.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security, and in such situations, we’ll never be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "historical", saying he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrat minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court as "history" and said that his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made his comments on Saturday, during an interview, at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of the fact that if she was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared “sterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s legal commission, which took place Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that he had sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost shouted and lost his voice because of the emotions, while discussing his family and the years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the commission, calling charges against him “a brutal and coordinated assassination of character”, organised by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when she was asked whether she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and whether Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which you are now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Columbia District Appeals Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Law accessible to care or the Roe versus Wade case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, partial person to go to court and expect to say, “Oh, that’s great,” Pelosi said.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diarrhy, it's months and years of accumulated rage and can't talk without crying out.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman in an executive position who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then continue.
I thought it was a great thing."
The tears are allowed for the externalisation of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, where I began to cry because of an inexpressible rage, is that I was stabbed by the head of an older woman, a cold director who I've always felt a bit of fear, and went to the stairs.
"You must never see yourself crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be happy that they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democrat in Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extra-husband relationship on a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason to run even to the presidency.
“It wasn’t a very good decision,” she says laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "White like Snow and the seven dwarfs".
Because the campaign was in the end, she was behind the fund-raiser and swore she wouldn't run unless she managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given her men $1,000, they only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get discounts?" she asked.
During the speech he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so affected by the emotions – as a result of the gratitude for the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to collect money and target voters instead of delegates, but also anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice because of emotions .
“You would have said that I have a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls about the reactions of the press to her.
"You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex."
I remember thinking about what they'll write on my gravestone.
"He cried?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial to Beijing?
Salves that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China were absurd and, although there seems to be still a long way to close it, disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for long-term Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning at the beginning of this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new taxes, which affected products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), actually applying taxes for half of all goods in China arriving in the United States.
Beijing took revenge every time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10 per cent for US products worth 60 billion dollars.
China has warned that it will respond to every strike from the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays cards well, the United States' trade war pressure could positively support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would in fact be more dangerous than what has been anticipated so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Centre for a New American Security (Center for New American Security), a group of experts.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the conditions on the scene are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists so that things get back to normal.
Existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affect their daily lives and lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011 when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after winning the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded the sixth consecutive win in Europe and no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came first after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn got 14.5 points, needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Miccelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit in the water to the 3rd of the 16th hole, giving up Francesco Molinari's match.
The Italian golf player Molinari has had an incredible performance in all rebukes, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since there is the current tournament format, since 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost at the holes 5 and 4 in front of the ultimate player in the ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen in Denmark.
The first player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost at the 2nd and 1st holes in front of Ian Poulter in England, probably his last game in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with the most winners, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It's a team job and I'm glad I could be of help," Garcia said excitedly after European victory.
He handed over the seal to his contagionary, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game, on Sunday.
“I’m very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to watch his games when I was a kid,” Rahm said, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being exceeded only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinary throughout the whole tournament.
The American team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they really did.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a cranberry fight.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will go further.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to give them proper respect.
They played better than us."
