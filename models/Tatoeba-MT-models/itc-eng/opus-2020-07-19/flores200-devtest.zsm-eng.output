Original citizens have never changed. Still, as before, they need more adjustment.
From time to time, as new residents, they began to adapt to the new environment, becoming less and less tolerant of other people.

In savanna, it is very difficult for a primate with such a human digestive system to satisfy the need for amino acid from the available plant resources.
And there will be a serious consequence of the failure to do so: the rise of depression, the inequitable diet, and the end of death.
The most readily available plant is protein found in leaves and nuts, but it is difficult to cope with primates like us unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, the food of animals is not easy to water, but it provides high-scale proteins containing all important amino acids.
All of this is considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors cope with their "protein problem" in the same way as the cimp in the savanna today.
