Members of the Assembly of the Wales concerned about "passing for puppets"
Galloists are appalled by a proposal to replace their titles with the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment to the Assembly's name, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of rallies.
An elected worker said that his group was concerned about the fact that the label “rime with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers not originating in Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Parti of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other forms.
The Conservative Party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marriage), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing a change of name, said that "the final decision concerning the designation of members of the Assembly is theirs."
The Government of Wales (Government of Wales Act, 2017) Act 2007 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Welsh Parliament, which has been widely supported.
On the question of membership, the Commission is in favour of members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Wales prefers MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could be a real headset for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a draft name change law in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the question of name in the discussions on the draft law.
Macedonia: referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be named the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a litigation of several decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has stressed that Macedonia's name constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said that he would not take account of the results.
However, partisans such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that changing names is only a small price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin reduced to silence
"The elderly people I discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street," says Adams.
"There is no more of it today."
According to him, it's only natural that the bars have become rare.
Today, "we don't get to date in the same way," he explains.
"We used to go to the bar as if we were at his neighbor's house, but that's not the case anymore."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before what those responsible imagine, and it is of concern to him: " sooner or later, they will return to the starting box."
He added that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who would not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
"People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely whites who will hasten the closure of all churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members," he expresses concern.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The early white Methodist Congregation left the places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was taken over by a black community under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops of the 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which the Blacks painted themselves for use or for promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and command a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor to the church of Saint Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called "the bells of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave him a different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon in Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather states that Saint Martin has not replaced him.
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of questions about the remittance of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the lay elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the parish council wanted to impose the costs incurred, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old teenager injured by shark during lobster fishing
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old last Saturday while practicing lobster fishing in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's TV channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming with help and went to pay up to him to get him out of the water.
At first Chad thought the young boy was crying out of joy for having had a hold, and then he realized that in reality he
It was bitten.
As he arrived near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I was shouting for everyone to come out of the water: There's a shark!" says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the hospital Rady Children in San Diego, where he is still in a critical state.
The shark species at the origin of the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, the rescue leader Larry Giles reported that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered trauma from the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 shark species, but most of them are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the UK aesthetics market
Sainsbury's hands down Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and ray garnits similar to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field specialists.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetic market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow while fashion and home sales are falling, more extensive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience turns out conclusive.
Supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to reuse the previously occupied space by TVs, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetic articles, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of boutiques such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of non-tested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the fragrance seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two stores in Sainsbury's, the first open last week in Croydon, south of London, and a second one whose opening is scheduled in the course of the year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders must cross their heads to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to make their purchases online and move to nearby shops for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, director general of Sainsbury's, said that the sales outlets will increasingly look like the large areas, as the supermarket chain tries to counter shops discount Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of shops and also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains two years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to propel the sales of common consumer goods and to make the purchase profitable.
The previous attempts to restructure the rays of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics in the British chain had been overcome by failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's partnership with Boots was attempted, but it ended up following a controversy about the distribution of benefits from pharmacies located in supermarkets.
It was after 3 years ago that he sold his 281 pharmacies for 125 million pounds in Celesio, the owner of the drug chain Lloyds, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, a wide range of high-end skin care brands.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been changed to improve the customer environment.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beautification of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now unquestionable and changes the buying habits," added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal of an agreement of £11 million
Winner of the Star of the Dragon's Den TV program, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the hoster Holly Willoughby from a contract of up to £11 million linked to his home decoration brand, to devote himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the interior decoration brand and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Plaintow.
Age 37, this Morning's cheerleader announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby was furious Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration in the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was furious when the beloved child of TV revealed, at a meeting that was held under tension at the headquarters of the commercial empire of Dragon's Den star in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, up to £1.5 million, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their brand of interior decoration and accessories.
The Truly brand has been likened to that of the actress Gwyneth Ptrew, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the estimated fortune of the entertainer to £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities
And it's going to ensure its future for the next 2 decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s seat is filled with products ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, which is one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause millions to lose to society, due to significant investments in goods ranging from cushions or candles, clothing or indoor items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
Moreover, this could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went together on vacation and Peter Jones held 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the M&S ambassador and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as an I'm A Celebrity programme host for ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was horrifying, but we finally loved it.
Trump made fun of the media that criticized him because of his comment that some people judge as "indignified by a president", and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
He was watching TV with a voice from a TV reporter.
"I have not given up at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had supported the holding of a second meeting, after Trump qualified the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a point of death.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy leader Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that there was no "response" response from the United States to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
It deplores the fact that, on the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his Trump assembly speech, it offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," North American President said.
We have engaged in armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile shooting tests, the release of hostages and the remnants of North American military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this arena full to crack, there's barely more than 200 standing in front of me," he criticized by pointing finger to the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGO assistance was not supposed to be necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the population in Lombok had been scattered, but no state of national disaster had been decreed, a condition required for the launch of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they did not want international assistance, which complicates things a little," said Ms. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization sets up a team to go to Palu, she still doesn't know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian assistance.
Despite the shocks it has constantly suffered, the country has a cruel lack of means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Some shelters have been provided in Aceh, but they are rarely located in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been communicated, no alarm siren has been reported to Palu, which has probably contributed to human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from Indonesian island to Indonesian island is not easy.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been posted in Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the new disaster site.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has placed the reform of the infrastructure under way at the centre of his electoral campaign and has spent considerable money on restoring roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, undermined Mr Joko's government, which was called to represent itself in front of the electors next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, deep into the streets of Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool attacker Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a defeat at the Liverpool in Premier League against Chelsea, marking at the 89th minute, Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was headed from 1 to 0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before he escaped a shot to the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before moving to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ends up reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its way to the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to place myself, to grab the ball, but players like Shaq always pull as far as possible, so I tried to make the most of the time," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really much thinking I decided to shoot."
Chelsea took 1 to 0 in mid-time after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the Blues struck a pass in the direction of Mateo Kovacic, before moving towards the middle of the ground and sprinter side Liverpool.
Kovacic realizes a quick go-and-come in the middle of the field,
then made a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard crossed the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a left foot shot behind the doorman of Liverpool, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitains in the group phase of the League of Champions, on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo de Naples Stadium, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in Europe League of UEFA, at 3:00 this Thursday in London.

Parliament: Cromwell's statue, last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the fair return of things, in the light of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural property of England, committed by its Puritian supporters, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and has described it as "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, says that "in view of the current debate about the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's one erected before the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor led the economy during the British civil wars.
It is likely that a person was sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith stated the following words in the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, I mean of the monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
Its achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated."
China: a pig kills a breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a Southeastern China market.
Identifyed as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery slashed and covered with blood near a dirt market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig shop on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday, in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door in the neighboring china was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighs 250 kg has mutilated the killer.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the cousin of the breeder, said that "his legs were rubbed and covered with blood."
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to either the breeder or his cousin.
One market leader told Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incident and to allow the police to collect evidence.
Mr. Yuan's family and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks against individuals have already been reported.
In 2016 on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously hurting the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig stuck a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get away from him.
In 2012, while a Oregon breeder had just been devoured by its pigs, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can lead to this type of behaviour.
"They are rather animals players,
very curious kids... they have no intention of harming themselves.
Just show them due respect," he assures them.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa should cause severe precipitation in the south-east of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa faints as it moves over the coldest waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will lead to adverse events in north-eastern Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
The winds were at 135 km/h (oragan category 1) for 5 hours in the morning, East Sunday time, while Rosa was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane should travel north on Sunday.
During this period, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows east to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches on Monday from the low-California peninsula in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the north, in the south-west of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico this Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the south-west in the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall from 2.5 cm to 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden crusts, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The aversities will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwest regions, especially a large part of Arizona.
Unscathed tropical rains are likely to cause high floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Intense rains could convert canyons into dried rivers and thunderstorms will produce wind gusts and dust pellets by places.
The approaching depression will give rise to abundant local rains in some southern regions of the country, on the California coast.
The total rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could result in low debris flows and make the chausé sliding.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical aversions will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rainfall will fall across the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Important variations in temperature are expected for the month of October through the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
this sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will be subject to considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat forces to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the center and east of the United States are expected to experience a hot October start, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the South Plains and other north-east regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
The multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures should be higher than the average in the east of the United States during the first fortnight of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
On 6 television stations on Thursday, the seizures of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse continues, the broadcasting services stopped their regular Friday program to announce a theatre strike: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate's Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had engaged in assaults on his person and had tried to take his clothes off during a high school night.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, also claimed to be 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial has probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Moreover, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose entertainers widely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most watched channel during the day of the hearings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with a hearing reaching 3.26 million.
They followed CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), always after Nielsen.
The interest did not weaken once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama playing Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a communiqué that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was taken apart by demonstrators as he attempted to take the elevator to the hearing of the judicial commission.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of the live interpellation.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," throws one of the women.
"Do you really believe that he tells the truth?
You hold power when so many women are poor.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake indicated that her office had issued a statement and would say more at the committee meeting.
All wired and broadcasted network channels covered the session live a few hours later, while the judicial committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh by the entire Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a one-week investigation should be conducted by the FBI first on the charges brought against the candidate, which the minority Democrats claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by discussing with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He took his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance sheet, as the Republicans would not actually have obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault charges.
Great Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making "little politics"
In an interview given to the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project of leaving the European Union, of making "small politics" to the detriment of the future of Britain and of national interest.
May arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks against his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "clearly ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police stop Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being the cause of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect from the fatal shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was beaten and charged with murder at the second level, said the Baton Rouge police service.
The authorities posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the change.
Founded at the crime scene, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, the subsidiary of the CBS group.
In his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police being responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the lawyer of the parish of Baton-Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by an injury by a bullet that crossed the head and stayed in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the medical-legal laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the law enforcement for their "commitment and quest for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Redge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, it marked 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rebounds per match during the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach said the team was "disassembled and under shock" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We write this kind of event all the time," says Wade.
Mexico: an ash crack volcano
From the ashes escaping from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Reduction Centre recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after having recorded a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The centre monitored several earthquakes and grunts from Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed fine layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity at the volcano level at 72 km from the capital, since a earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between the police and the separatists approaching the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and the riot police, while thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being refouled by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not dissipate tourists.
Heats also exploded later that day, while the police used matraques to contain the clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence that would scan "neither forget nor forgive", faced unionist partisans shouting "long life in Spain".
14 protesters with mild injuries were treated according to the local press.
One year after the referendum on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain alive in the independent region.
A overwhelming majority of voters have chosen independence, despite a low rate of participation, who have largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing the polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It was all the same place, but it was forced to take a different itinerary.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said that he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
"We were witnesses last year of a great time.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in an impasse," he regrets.
Despite their capital victory, albeit minor, in the regional elections last December, independent Catalan parties had difficulty maintaining momentum this year, many people's leaders were exiled or detained pending trial for holding the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who filmed the demonstration of police support on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand and on the other.
"Treatment only rises," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a trial since last year, announced his intention to apply for the European Parliament elections next year.
"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government," he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men percussion a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being buried several times on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballenagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrow shots.
Livingston wins match 1 to 0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
The first goal of Dolly Menga ensures Livingston's victory
Recently raised in grade, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games in Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
The goal of Menga made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place themselves in the second position of the ranking, equal with Hibernian.
Gerard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premiership league this season, and have to face the Hearts team Sunday, which leads 8 points.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she has extended 6 games in the division, and her main coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can be tempted to have not yet lost the least meeting.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of angry opponents
Holt's team could have come forward long before they started, as their direct approach put the Rangers in difficulty.
Scott Robinson tried to perch but remained stuck in front of the opposing goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
Livingston's team left the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that it could interfere with them thanks to the tactics worked.
That's where the decisive goal is.
The Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston tried to open up; Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to corner Menga, who took a touch and entered a goal of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves in the face of an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only rarely worried.
The second half-time experienced the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced a halt from Kelly.
The Ranger Guardian Allan McGregor stopped a hit by Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to play one of the Livingston's plans.
The Keeper of Livingston rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the arbitrator, one for the rebellion of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a lack of hands.
Livingston’s “Female” - Analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and stunning results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and team composition have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the merit is largely to Holt for having since his motivated arrival a team
that counts many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grand and beautifully organized, and Menga managed to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in a haleine for the duration of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed one last opportunity and failed to penetrate the opposing side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of a picture.
Home mixed by President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Several issues, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU, have been addressed.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, made their voices heard, condemning both the Erdogan policies and the German government's decision to welcome it in its country.
The cleavage that emerges from protests reflects Erdogan's double vision: a visitor welcomed by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocrat by others.
Accident of the road to Deptford: a cyclist dies following a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at around 10.15 local hours, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent road from Deptford to the south-east of the city.
The vehicle driver stopped, the rescue arrived on site, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London police said the officers were doing everything they could to identify the individual and to prevent his or her relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been put in place. Car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 officers injured in a riot
The senior security officer of the prison reported that six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot started in the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, around 0930 hours this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Anti-Smuggling specialists were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On site, the officers were treated for mild facial injuries.
A spokesperson from the prison management said: "From trained personnel has been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six agents were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. The officials will have to answer the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended."
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the director of the prison was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot agents were sent to prison to stem a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the personnel with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by high creases (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is what is likely to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading for the south-west desert with what remains of its energy. This region could be affected by sudden crusts.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with announcing rains from Monday night.
The national weather service based in Phoenix stated in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center provide 5-10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Grand Basin should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be lifesaving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of sudden crudeness.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial to the south-west region, given the current drought.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, just over 40% of Arizona had at least one extreme drought, the second most serious category," saidweather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins his journey on the coast, in the peninsula of Basse-Californie.
Always with great power on Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at 20 km/h speed.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the strength of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and could lead to flood risk.
"In total, between 7.5 cm and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the border of Arizona Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross the Arizona and the south of Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
"Row rains are expected in Basse-Californie, north-west of Sonora and in the south-west desert and are the main danger," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially fatal peaks and flow of debris in the arid areas, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted homicide, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, Saturday about 4am in the morning at local time.
He was sent to the hospital, his condition is currently stable.
Avon and Sommerset police reported arresting the four young people (age 17, 18 and 20) on the night of the Radstock side.
The officers called on people who might have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been a victim of the wickedness and anger of Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the wickedness and anger of Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of Congress on Thursday, rejecting with energy and emotion Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that accused him of sexually assaulting him several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" today.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of the Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting all the fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to a statement by a member of the Republican Party at CNN.
Indonesia: an earthquake and tsunami of hundreds of victims, the balance sheet continues to skyrocket
On Saturday, the authorities said that at least 384 people had died, most of them being carried away by huge waves that had been killed on the beaches while a earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of Célébes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when six-metre high waves submerged the beach at the fall of the night. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People didn't run away immediately, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Catastrophe Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone. He drove cars, pieces of wood, dwellings, he took everything with him," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved in the middle of the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing to the trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air images published by the Disaster Management Agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes have been felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (PPPT) stated that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Corporals were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho stated that human and material losses could be more significant over 300 km north of Palu, a region called Domanga, the closest to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications were "completely paralyzed" from Dogalgaa, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," La Croix Rouge said in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disseminating the information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived as time for the alert to be published.
A shared amateur video on social media shows a man standing on the floor of a building that frenzied the passersby on the street that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall lay on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate images immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a general power failure that cut all communications to Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to route aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has reopened as a relief operation, but it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centres of Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: The tsunami victim's record is rising, with more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The members of the World Vision staff of Domigaa arrived safely in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters located in the courtyard of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to the disaster victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not yet the case.
"This disaster is still considered regional," Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that it is a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing people still hoped for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescuers have released a woman enveloping under the debris for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gendon Subandano, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, and M. Mandigi added.
"As an old in paragliding discipline, I have experienced my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon reported that he had desperately sent messages WhatsApp to athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages remained unanswered.
"I think they never received my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves underestimate $26,750 when charging an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport police service.
The vehicle driver lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a money bag for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leave the place, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Everyone with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Anciently known as Kanye West."
41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to the program Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his coming for "emotional reasons," explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation of its current pseudo professional, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you," explained West earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
"Then I am you, I am us.
I moved from Kanye, which means “the only one, ” to Ye - reflect the good, evil, confusion, of all things.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the tie of union and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO states that it will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, almost 50 years after bloody reprisals of law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that Tlatelolco would "never use military force to punish the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened the fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people at the time the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities motivate young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several actors in the U.S. government made announcements about IA, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the leader of AI innovation by 2030.
"Dubling funds for research in IA would be a good start, as all other countries have a long lead on the United States, and we are looking for the next major discovery in IA," says Lee.
Double the funds could double the chances that the next key stage in the U.S. I.I. is coming from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most important companies of China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that beat the best-class American Othello player. He then integrated Microsoft Research's management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to obtain funding from the government.
"It's not China that owns university leaders, it's companies," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large academic names to work on IA.
Lee added that the changes in immigration policies could also support U.S. efforts in relation to IA.
"I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers," he says.
The Council of State Affairs of China unveiled its new generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier in the year, the US Department of Defence has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academic partners. The White House has announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million per year in research in the IA.
At the same time, the US legislation that works to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action in several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard at a referendum on the change of their country's name for the Republic of Macedonia of the North. This change would resolve a conflict of several decades old with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of which is called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name represents a right on its territory and has opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalists said that the change would affect the ethical identity of the slave population of Macedonia, a majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote at the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% participation required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to the partisans of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which has escaped the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that she can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," Olivera Georgijska said, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the vote was not legally binding, sufficient members of the parliament claimed that they would follow the result of the vote and make it decisive.
The change of name would require a majority of two-thirds of parliament.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1300 hours.
But the participation was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that had mobilized 66% of the voters registered after the vote.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the voice for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to go through the big door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from necessary investments.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr. Zaev after filing his newsletter.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of the participants who intended to vote said that they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, 50 per cent of the votes plus one vote are required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-West government since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, leads a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 match on Saturday, at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The goal of Aguero, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine butter received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three defenders of Brighton before diving in the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He circled around a defender before evicting the others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the balloon to Sterling on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to return the balloon to Aguero, who used his right foot to cheat Brighton's guard, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, team coach, to journalists.
"We said he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the chance he had at the time."
But it was Sterling who had given the initial advantage to Skyblues during the First League game,
29th minute.
Aguero received the balloon directly on Brighton's field.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few hits before taking Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the balloon into the nets just before they slipped out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play Fever Disorders Against Rockies
As the Nationals team got rid of the play-off race, there was no reason to run into a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Rockies of Colorado, but only in case of an elimination match for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies took him to the Nationals on Friday evening, but they are still trying to secure their first division title.
"Even if this game doesn't have any issues, we want to throw the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and in front of a team that will probably play at the highest level I have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate? »
The Nationals must still announce a launcher starting on Sunday, but would be inclined to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will launch during his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The law enforcement officer of Washington is at 18-7 with an average merit of 2,53 and 300 withdrawals on catches in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The President alluded to the situation that generated his support for the Supreme Court in Brett Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of the Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a major issue. I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever. That is why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this terrible, really horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They care about whom they hurt, whom they crush to take power and control. That is what they want, power and control, and we will not give them."
Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it over the last four days," he added, before calling the democrats of people "angry, mean and lying."
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the U.S. Senate and Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which led him to be hated by the public.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Have you released the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community he was.
It is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When activists from the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour Party parliamentarians who are considered not to be welcome.
My Parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she rose against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the gathering of the Nottingham East Labour on Friday said: "We want the gathering to be inclusive and productive."
This is exactly what the Friday evening general assemblies were for my eight years as a Labour Party parliamentarian.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today for many gatherings and the promise of more mild and more respectful policies has been forgotten for a long time if it has never been taken into account.
It became clear that the opposing opinions were no longer tolerated in the party. Each opinion was judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy's taking power. The colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political vision began to wait for me to return my jacket and take a stand against my convictions, whether it is about national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, it was abusive on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I had received were of a political nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a lack of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things about the current policy is the normalization of various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is confined to the motions of defiance and amendments to the rules of selection.
I've been given a lot of advice over the past two years: to lower my eyes, not to express my ideas so loud, and everything would be fine.
But it is not to act as I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, because the neglect of the Thatcher government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it the most, whether as a local advisor or minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and disputes with current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion Friday is that the country goes to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my electors, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunity will prevent me from acting for the causes that I defend, which are your interests to all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr remains invincuous
Two late tests may have failed the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph after the intense game day of the Scottish Rugby Championship at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the ranking and becomes the only team invincible of the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate this match.
"Until now, we have been tested. But we remain invincus, so I must think I am happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose congratulated Ayr: "Good to them, they have been more effective than we and have been able to seize the opportunities."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute test, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow board for the Scottish Wing Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the figures speak. Jason Baggot took a non-transformed test.
Climo worsened the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of the day. It marked and transformed a solo test to climb the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose started the second half-time and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
A long wait was followed because of a serious wound from Ruaridh Knott, who left the ground on a civilian. At the recovery, Ayr resumed the fronts with a Stafford McDowall test transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow cardboard and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an unprocessed test by Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team got back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having typed Climo while he did not have the ball, since the touch of the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's apple, which was progressing.
Climo turned the test, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry's wingman away for the fifth home team test.
Still Game star launches in restaurant
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-animizes with his long-standing partner on stage, Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the ninth series coming will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "flowering environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol an armored boat in the La Paz naval headquarters.
Public buildings build a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazonia, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: "The sea returns to us by law.
The recovery is a duty."
Throughout the entire Bolivia blocked, the memory of a lost coast to the benefit of Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still well present. Just like the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades. Bolivia is expecting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be issued on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive result," explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will take a decision in favour of Bolivia's application. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile should be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for the reelection next year), also has much to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
"We are so close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will decide in favor of Chile. And that little would change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations instance based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant a Chilean territory, and it has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, an expert Chilean in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, perhaps the last four years have even hurt her.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
The war rhetoric of Morales has undermined all the remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very complicated to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represented Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring to Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - which remains to date one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political beech.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past."
North Korea affirms that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said that his country would not defend its nuclear weapons until it would have confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed about to relaunch a nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Jong One, the current North Korean leader.
Ri states that it is "chemical" to think that maintaining sanctions and opposition from the United States to a statement that will put an end to the Korean war will collapse the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant pre-emptive disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's seriousness of giving up an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is discussed.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in order to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades reveal the latest trends in curfew, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun to 100%, no longer look.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delirious oversized hats during a PE19 parade that honored the fashion week style of Paris.
All the more extravagant hats the others invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delirious pieces into the parades.
Valentino's lightpiece was a beige eccentric hat adorned with a broad edge that evoked a feather, which covered the head of the mannequins.
The other oversized accessories included jewelry-plated pastries, a sorcery hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had soft lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than the Upper Couture.
One creation looked like a diving equipment, with tubing and glasses, while another was thinking of a molten ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the silage of the "Bomba", the straw hat on board wide that the stars pull, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard portable hat that has flooded social networks has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the swimsuit mannequin that wore it.
The burnt orange bree bag, decorated with fringes and a white leather handle, was the masterpiece of the PE19 parade The Jacquemus Riviera during the Fashion Week in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the great beach hats and bags arrive in the shops for next summer. The creator has so marked the spirits that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills Are Essential to World Citizens · Global Voices
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a school record of excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by a collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are striving to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and setting up a school-based programme, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and build trust with the people of other countries.
Looking at the excellent results of this year's exams, we see that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest rating, A, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as subjects are organized, as are science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 reveals that among the difficulties faced by employers in recruiting candidates, 17% are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
Regardless of his career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real benefit in the future through this sustainable competence.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not master a foreign language to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking in several languages, especially those of emerging economies, children will have better chances of finding rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are important to the United Kingdom in the context of 2020, including Mandarin and Japan.
Regardless of your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary for their success, regardless of what the future holds.
It is clear that at present, in a global trading environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look at LeBron James' beginnings at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Laker Coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play yet.
"More than one, less than 48," said Walton on the official site of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training, early in the week, James was asked about his pre-season plans, which includes six games.
"At this stage in my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Trump Campaign in West Virginia ( YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump started a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stairways, especially in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
As Trump was postponed, the vote to confirm the vacancy in the Supreme Court was seeking support for the upcoming mid-term elections and to prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in November.
What time does Trump's meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19.00 (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the candidate's hearings at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until one week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings aims primarily to help the Republicans win the field for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American President stated in his campaign that the five meetings aimed to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congret control is such an essential element of its program that the President will make as many states as possible at the beginning of the electoral campaign," said Reuters, a spokesperson for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, programmed at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of Pittsburgh's media."
On Saturday, this will be the second trip to Trump in West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is in the middle of the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to relaunch it in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political science specialist at West Virginia University, Reuters said.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope close to the simple Sunday
After three simple, Saturday afternoon foursomes could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The swing balance movement is a sports concept invented of all the pieces but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in such tournaments as this one.
Where, then, would they find the momentum now?
"They were taking six points in advance and now four, so this gives us some wings," Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the benefit, of course, with four points ahead and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel that they have a bit of a doll wind and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and can strive to have each three points out of four.
Spieth has shown himself terribly effective from tea to tea and set the example.
The screams of energetic joy intensified as his game advanced. A crucial putt allowed him to match the fourth part while Thomas and he were led two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, sparked a similar scream, from those who tell you that he believes the American team still in high school.
"You really have to stay determined and focus on your game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players right now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the story of the Ryder Cup shows.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four matches and has no right to error.
Not only were "Moliwood" the only ones not to realize a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped there Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way in which their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd deliriously designate them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to which they are delighted with a potential European victory while the sun falls on the National Gulf.
They'd rather be both at different holes at the same time.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, hero of the fourballs of the morning, while he was teaming up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent Spanish and Swedish into a hole they could never show up.
On the other hand, no one is here on Sunday to help you.
The fourballs and the forsomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and those they don't give, and how a strategy can tilt into a wink.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made considerable progress over the last day, but this foursome session has also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 during the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after it won 10-6 on the United States during fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
The duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari carried the charge with two victories on a Tiger Woods in distress, which enabled them to score four points until now.
Determined to retain the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning fourballs, facing a disordained American team.
The United States has demonstrated greater resistance in the ants and has won two victories, but they have failed to resort the gap.
Jim Furyk's men have to pick up eight points on 12 Sundays when they are simple to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to pick up four points in line, while Molinari and him, named "Molliwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history to get four points during their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they cut the pair made up of the American beginner Bryson Dechanbeau and a Woods already tired by a 5 and a 4 even more categorical.
Woods, who slashed during the two matches on Saturday, shone a few times, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and forsomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the forsomes, winning the 2-1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, within a short time but clear.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the reference for the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the forsome, they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, had only to do zero match to keep its trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea states that disarmament cannot become unilaterally untrustworthy.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions strengthened its confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for its country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in these circumstances.
At the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as ending nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the lack of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves."
While reiterating North Korea's well-known reproach on Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, its statement was important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore at the first meeting between an American President and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to working for a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and increases pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even opposing the "declaration of the end of war".
"Those who think that these sanctions can make us rain don't know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ri made no comment about the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted before the United Nations by the American leader earlier this week.
The minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: "If the party concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a deadlock."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he had stated before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point the North Korean missiles on North American territory after President Trump had qualified Kim as a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations in the past year to "completely destroy" North Korea, did not praise this year for the courage with which Kim applied disarmament measures, but added that there was still much to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that no time limit had been set. "It may take two years, three years or five months; it does not matter," he said.
China and Russia maintain that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must be firmly and systematically maintained until the complete, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to undermine the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month in order to prepare a second summit.
This year, Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made, but in the hours following, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding the security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to standardize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Rest Courses
This year, the University of Harvard has set up a new course that allows all first-cycle students to sleep more and fight against the growing Machist trend that involves studying as a caffeine consumption all night.
A professor noted that most students at the best university in the world can't take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of the kind in the United States.
It is after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea has come to him
At the end, a student approached me and said, "Why do I have to say this to myself in the last year?"
She stated that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of Health Services at the University, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee fees, curtains, basketballs, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical benefits and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not instantly change the behavior of students.
However, we believe they have the right to know this information - in the same way you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health is," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of " spending a white night" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the growing pressure exerted on students constantly make sleepiness a growing problem.
Having enough sleep and good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain in mode of innation, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and moved him to insist that it be offered throughout the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to propose to all third-cycle students to follow a similar curriculum before joining the renowned institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students predict an alarm as well for bedtime as for awakening, and be aware of the adverse effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleeping disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The goal of Menga is to kick the men of Gerard
The Rangers suffered a new blow outside, the attack by Dolly Menga having led Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team to Livingston towards a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team hoped to record its first victory on the move from his 4-1 triumph in February to St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted his second defeat on Gerard in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team drifting, eight points behind Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises in third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the referee Calum Spence had to be cured for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerard made eight changes in the team, which swept Ayr in half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, chose the same Livi 11 that pulled a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team suffocating his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored two minutes, when the first shot of Menga sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle of the field let his chance pass.
Keaghan Jacobs then took a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have received a penalty after the free shot when Steven Lawless and he got hit, but arbitrator Steven Thomson dismissed Colombian demands.
The Rangers took advantage of only two shots in the first period, but the former guardian of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria hit.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute took place against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed at Jacob's arrest.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard reacted in mid-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the wing appeared before Morelos, but impressive Kelly rushed to make a block.
Livingston has also continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long bullets on long bullets.
Holt's team could have taken the advantage in the last few moments, but McGregor did well to put Jacobs away before Lithgow passed by the goal.
The Ranger replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again called for a penalty at the end of the game while he was caught with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNE ACCOUNT... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger meter.
Science pillar since then, Geiger has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "He's a Geiger meter, used to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, the effects of the atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity can really be heard."
Evans: "Say, then, it sure goes down there!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" and kill cancer cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting and modifying immune cells from a patient in a laboratory
They can then "decelerate" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract and modify immune cells from a patient in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally to re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein "protein causes an increase of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to "learn" to target cancer cells, has been demonstrated in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Coiffé of a MAGA helmet, Kanye West began in a Pro-Trump diatribe after its passage to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was horrified on the stage after a deranged performance during which he praised President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to run for the 2020 elections.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again, West took over the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times, I speak to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL show started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe has been relayed on social media by comédian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the backyards because of his helmet.
"They pressured me.
They told me not to come with this cap on the head.
They pressureed me!
And after they say I'm in a dump," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the gouffer?" and claimed that he would wear his superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted him from the public at least twice, and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. A person on-site told the magazine: "A death silence has fallen on the whole plateau."
West had been called to replace the last minute singer Ariana Grande, including the former little friend, the Mac Miller rapper, died a few days earlier.
West dissociated many by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the bravest minds: GOOD OF VIEW TENU TO THE FOULE."
But Karen Hunter, the broadcast's cheerleader, tweeted that West was simply "loyal to himself, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes or by supporting his art) who, in my view, adopts and pours out a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the traces of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogg rapper named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fire, which changed his name as a symbol, and then that of the artist previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes care of the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as an end lame, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent fantasy medieval series.
But the 31-year-old actor took the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to get turned into tough leather to be respected.
In an interview given to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that he said "something is wrong" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at #Metoo time.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, covedette of Game of Thrones, also aged 31, confessed that he had "firmly" to address this question.
"Personally, I think deeply that we have harmed masculinity."
"What lessons have we taught young men who become adults, in relation to the problem that now arises?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What behavior is innate, what behaviour has been inculcated?
What does television and the street teach young boys who encourage them to think that they must behave in this way to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change that?
There's obviously something that's wrong."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do prologues or follow-up when the series ends next summer, claiming that he ended with "the battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will be the star of a return of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now," he says.
Rose intersected Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, to the Leslie family domain.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are involved.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected in sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese Government has promised, since 2003, universal access to drugs against HIV.
Maxine Waters disagrees that an employee of the PDO has disclosed information about senators, and denounces "hazardous lies" and "complement theories".
On Saturday, American Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and "extreme right" websites.
"Talks, lies, and still infamous lies" reacted Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It would appear that the disclosed information included the addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown in Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information."
"This false allegation is completely false and a true lie."
Waters' statement quickly gave rise to online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press officer.
"This denial is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that it does not have the temperament necessary to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something she has not done, she should not be angry.
She shouldn't be provocative.
It must not challenge the accuser's motives.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also spoke of his reflections on Twitter.
"If that's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters indicated that his office had warned "the authorities and services responsible for the enforcement of the laws concerned" about these fraudulent assertions.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English still hit. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, spy under duoé
It has now become a tradition of looking for Brexit's scope in any new British film and it seems to apply to this recovery of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and remade surface in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satire on the question of the evidence of our insignificance represent the new export opportunity of our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes etched and rubber face, saw his licence renewed for the second time in a confusing context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts of glamorous charm, has a little Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the type that performs a small note in Les Chariots of fire during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
Originally, he was also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the television advertising Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has a sympathetic moment or two.
I liked Johnny English getting close to a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at the time when "serious" licenses like 007 and impossible Mission make up themselves in full confidence with comedy.
Humour seems to be more oriented towards children than toward adults and, for me, Johnny English's measures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent movie gags in Bean's character.
The constant premise is that Britain has serious problems.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the supersecret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great disarray of agents in service - a weakly large role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character quasi-Teresa-May, but there is little to put herself under the stage.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means that Johnny English himself must be disturbed, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school teacher, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: some beautiful farces here, because English proposes a spying academy like Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-term partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who create great trouble for Her Majesty's secret services, reassess to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister falls dangerously under the influence of the technological billionaire charismatic, who is said to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of tedious jokes: under the disguise of servers, they set the fire to a bright French restaurant; they create a chaos by falsifying themselves on Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English triggers a true anarchy when he tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
All stops are secured for this last sequence, but despite all, there's not bad things for children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't help but think, as for Johnny English's other films: Can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really enhance his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to have developed a plan for the British to be able to work four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party needs to examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by providing them with an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while still paying the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would agree with the party's economic programme and plans to guide the country for workers.
The four-day trip was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not happen in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalance the economy for workers and with its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week does not constitute a party policy and is not envisaged by it."
The alternate Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to give details about his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power in the hands of "anonymous directors" and " profit-holders" in public utilities.
The plans of the alternate chancellor also provide that current water company shareholders may not recover the full amount of their placement as the Labour Government could operate "deductions" due to alleged deviations of conduct.
It has also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into business boards and the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private enterprises to employees, which will involve up to £500 dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy entrust to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was postponed from at least one week after the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a widespread interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent of the "60 Minutes" program, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"By going to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
It was resolved, determined, without error.”
However, Graham's vote appears to be engraved on the stone.
"I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and there would be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically," Graham added, alluding to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she named couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old affair.
I see nothing new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star-marked and equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now at its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people coming to Central Park's Great Lawn in order not only to benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the festival, namely ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), viewers were required to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, telephoneing or making any other useful efforts to raise awareness of the population in the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really allow them to be persuaded to call for action, or is it just another example of "clectivism" - a situation in which people really think to make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to encouraging global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, including at least $10 billion of which has already been disbursed or raised.
The group believes that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed themselves to "help children develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda assistance of 35 million pounds Sterling to end malnutrition in that country after receiving over 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and the Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Mr.Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the The Power of Nutrition program at a concert that took place in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following the company's over 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, as the great civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will do so, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could call on the Navy to create a "block" to impede Russian energy exports - Secretary to the Interior
In order to avoid that Russian energy arrives in markets, including in the Middle East, Washington may "if necessary" appeal to the US Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russia's presence in Syria, in particular where it operates at the request of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct their energy from being placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that is defined as the "power consumers' spokesperson" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in reality the same.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia by saying that it has "more than one string at its arc" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements arrive at a time when the Trump administration has committed to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the "inappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prisoner" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the current capacity for up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech delivered in Moscow in September following a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Energy Secretary, the Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said "I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has provoked negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to become involved in European energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of taking part in the 2020 presidential elections, says the Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be thinking of presenting herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top," she says, The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider submitting my candidacy to the Presidentials."
Warren said what she thought about President Donald Trump at the public gathering, claiming that he "led this country in the wrong direction."
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that it is expected to take place in 2020.
According to the survey of the Political Research Centre at the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of very prominent Democrats mentioned for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of the Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin evokes Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is currently experiencing, what he feels about coming home, I can link it to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers are returning," she told the public at the meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa in Oklahoma.
Palin has qualified his arrest as a taboo subject and said about his son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering whether they would respect what their friends and members of the air forces, and each other military, gave to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson from Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a relationship of domestic violence and possession of an intoxicated weapon.
18 States and the Columbia District are in favour of a judicial dispute over the new asylum policy
18 States and the Columbia District are in favour of a judicial dispute over the new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and the district filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum-seekers who challenged this policy, NBC News said.
The complainant's full name in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had attacked her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeal of Immigrants, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law states that all asylum applications must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said amicus curiae in his memoir.
The lawyers also argued in the memory that the policy of refusal of entry of immigrants affects the American economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing marital violence and gang violence in June.
"The asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political convictions," Sessions, on 11 June, in its announcement of the so-called political policy.
"The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people encounter every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her fiebre little boy in Palu, in a city evacuation center.
“Every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen to go to their destroyed homes, to pick up scraped goods, and to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of the military hospital in Palu, where the patients were being treated outside due to severe persistent replications.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," said Haris to Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" by means of "propaganda advertising"
One week after a Chinese official newspaper released a four-page advertisement boasting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in a U.S. daily newspaper, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in Les Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to join the US parliamentary elections on 6 November, an accusation that China refutes.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to join the US elections, Trump marked what the US leaders said to Reuters to be a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures aimed at hitting state exporters such as Iowa supporting Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion paper published in the Sunday's Les Moines Register, China "is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paid advertising into the Les Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"On the other hand, at the Beijing press outlet, you will find few contestative voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the disturbing Chinese economic trajectory, as the media are firmly obeying the Chinese communist party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying what newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republicans draw the electors closer to the mid-term elections because of the Kavanaugh break-up.
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the next mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, said "we can't go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) in favour of an FBI investigation were enough to calm the anger of voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said last September, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, the protesters sang "The month of November arrives!" in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans in the Judiciary chose to advance Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be measured," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in suburban electricians and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, even if they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even prior to Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the nominee of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that the reaction might be alive if the Republicans made further confirmation.
According to NBC News, the former president of the National Republican Committee, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week that "it became a mess for the GOP."
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh, but also the way in which the Republicans managed the situation and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps the elected Democrats, on the television newspaper.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans appear to be divided on the credibility of both parties, a small majority on the latter side.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41 per cent of the people consulted believed in Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent said they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, following the pressure of Senator Flake.
Ford testified on oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while being drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the candidate to the Supreme Court would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's Solid-Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as people who are allowed to access such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated by jokingly that Inrut was intended to "lord the world."
"We must do it now," he said about the launch.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The particularity of the personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
From this week onwards, technological developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that his team and they are not yet in discussion with " Facebook and Google" in order to know whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely shabbed in an instant.
"We do not ask for permission."
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the [Inrupt] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he launched Inrut, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann : Celebration of a World War First Churchist decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only churchman of the Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and did not know that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, claimed that he was "clearly symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after the operation of his grandfather.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann headed his battalion on the canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under the violent shooting of campaign cannons and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with the "greatest bravery", he drove the line before jumping a campaign cannon on his own, and assembling three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
The fans of mixed martial arts have stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent all night watching a 206 Bellator well filled, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, there were 13 fights, of which six were on the main record, and it was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the United Kingdom viewers were sided with when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to stay awake until early morning, especially for the fight.
A supporter on Twitter described the transition to animated drawing for children as "a kind of bad joke."
Regarding the transmission, the Chief Marketing and Communications Vice-President at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation provides that at 6 a.m., this content was not adapted, so they had to fall back to the children's programs."
"Peppa the Pig", yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I believe that when I think about recasting, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But it's six hours a Sunday morning and we won't be able to find a solution before Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program went down, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more for fans and we have wasted everything.
It's a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" in terms of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old boy said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "everybody [was] not like me."
As part of the first radio show 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young's usual show presenter took several months' leave because of her illness.
Appeared as a shipwreck in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "These feelings of being inferior and different today are the real things that have given me the power and strength necessary for my success."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about their sexuality, he wanted to prove that it was "something," he continued.
The dual Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and has taken advantage of his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was expressing himself because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and thus wanted to restore "hope" to others.
The world's triple champion claimed that he "did not wait" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you experience so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he said that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had known the same height and low.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his entire perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I thought only to win a gold medal," he says.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after a brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be sitting in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Father, you won't be here anymore to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and he was dead to finally admit that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, this inspired him with his first choice of song - Proud of Heather Small - who accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the flesh of the chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 a.m. BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to go straight away to avoid this unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dismissed by Captain Jim Furyk from the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the fifth major champion shared his day between the role of supporting and finishing his game at the stand in order to remedy his evils.
He has never been the greatest of the drivers, even at the top of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rush systematically punishes the wrong hits.
And as if the course was not dubious enough in itself, Mickelson, during the ninth Sunday game, confronted Francesco Molinari, the winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, at four down at the beginning of the 12 simple matches, take a good start, Micchelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, hit me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“ He has great confidence in him.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I expected more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we think we have to do it.
He wants to be there, like all the others."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of Ryder Cup fights.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never really reached the heights of its individual record.
Micchelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven demits, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players had the pleasure of measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
It does much more than play."
European selection captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the day of the last Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful journey.
The Danes fought his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Sève Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally got up at the top of the ranking with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, taking it 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were leading a lot to Valderrama; we had a big breakthrough at Brookline, where we failed, as well as at Valderrama, where we won, but fair," Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 Rating to win the 5-3 win both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to run 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Let's do it tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over before you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, namely trying to win this trophy, and that is where we need to stay focused.
I have always said I focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Ravi of the performances of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will be presented and it will go any other way.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message to get to the players, it's to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind, he must go to get the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as a team member, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have obtained three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these overhauls of the last day, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the "Miracles of Medinah", where Europe took the victory.
"I remember every word," he explains in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
"We have important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, exerts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We've established our training accordingly and put the guys as we think we have to do it, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of conducting the counterattack and will face Rory McIllroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn said on his simple selections.
The new warship of Germany still postponed
According to local media, the new frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenditures.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesperson, the launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of all new frigates of the Bad-Würtemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel should have integrated the Navy in 2014, but the problems of concern after delivery have undermined the fate of this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Bade-Wurtemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stolen technologies, such as radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for a period of up to two years outside the docking ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the continuing delays mean that the pre-war-guard ships - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and material defects" that made the warship unnecessary in the event of deployment to combat mission.
The software failures were particularly important because the ships of the Bade-Würtemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen class.
In addition, it appears that the ship is heavily overburdened, which reduces its performance and reduces the Marine's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7000-tonnes Rheinland-Pfalz weigh twice as much as the similar class vessels used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of €3.1 billion (3.6 billion), compared to 2.2 billion initially.
The problems related to new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the recent warnings that Germany's naval force is decreasing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact "short of vessels able to deploy".
The manager stated that the situation had resulted in a snowball effect over time, as the old ships had been decommissioned but no replacement ships had been designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Bade-Wurtemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these single flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bats and the activities of different species.
A map and a report on habitat will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as prairies and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the population of bats has declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects perchours and leads to loss of habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also represent a risk, as well as the kill-mock paper and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as the company cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, given their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to identify insects and obstacles to their flight route.
In charge of the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perchatory inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only reserve of bats of Scotland on the site of Thrave in Dumfries-et-Gallow, which houses eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland.
David Thompson, domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have an ideal place for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand better what bats need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of verifying the presence of bats before maintaining the properties, because by destroying it without wanting a single maternity nest, it is possible to cause the death of 400 female and small, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disturb them, or to destroy their perchoirs.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our bats and about many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations for now."
Ronaldo refutes rape charges while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the accusations of rape against him as "misinformation", and claimed that people "want to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to pursue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He would have then paid $375,000 to keep her silence on this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
Referring to its 142 million fans in a live video on Instagram, a few hours after the spread of the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo described this information as "misinformation".
« No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," said the camera the fifth winner of the Golden Ball.
"They want to make out of the pub by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel about these allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage of a proportion to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the human rights of the past few years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the casino le Palms hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would have occurred, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo was kneeling after the alleged incident and assured him to be a "man well" at "99%" but he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they were consented.
Majorga also stated that she had gone to the police and that pictures of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "feared by reprisals" and was afraid "to suffer public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman states that she is now seeking to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret" the departure of the car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if it had lost its position as world leader in the construction of cars after Brexit.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby, if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of border delays on the possibility of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures the Auris and Avensis vehicles of Toyota - has built nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% have been exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what car manufacturers qualify for risks to the Brexit supply chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in "tendu flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured on control.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, there could be border disturbances which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortage of coins.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory more than a day at her Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Czechs plan for future relations with the EU is "specificly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will enable, as I said, not only to benefit from the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has turned out to be an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota had not been able to specify for how long the production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the United Union factory and who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back."
A government spokesperson stated: "We have proposed a specific and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
La Maison-Blanche announces that the Trump and Rosenstein meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rejected for a week", while the struggle for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser responsible for investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the possible barriers to justice exercised by the President.
The question of whether or not Trump will return the Deputy Attorney General, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday he presented himself at the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump indicated that he would "want not" to send Mr. Rosenstein back, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission, to which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the complaints against Kavanaugh, which is still delaying the vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's press officer, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance in Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we were to postpone for another week given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press informed."
The statement would be challenged by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conferences at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the lectures was not due to an aversion to "demagogic" television reporters, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they break the gallery."
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without mentioning evidence, she added that "the president participates in more sessions of questions-response than any other president before him": "We have checked the numbers."
Press conferences will always take place," said Sanders, "but if the press has a chance to directly question the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it frequently, you have seen it in recent weeks, and that will take the place of a press conference where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It's rare for press conferences to be held alone.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and by moments a strange appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
Regarding the fears regarding Brexit, the Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish Parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of applications for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "In the summer negotiations on withdrawal continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each one of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate the extent to which I consider the contribution of each staff member, irrespective of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is exactly your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having suffered a head injury, Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, from Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Tengers of Tennessee, was operated urgently after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, chief coach of the State of Tennessee, told journalists that the injury had occurred just before mid-time.
"It arrived on the touch line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a roadside and taking it to another test.
A representative of the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center's operating room.
Harris explained that there was still no "explanation of the type or extent of the injury" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an athlete in the second year, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five plaques in total Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total of the season to 18 plaques.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they purchase property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people under new conservative regimes
This will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp rate if they buy property in the United Kingdom - extra money will help homeless people, will announce Theresa May today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by committed to providing more affordable housing and target people with high incomes.
Increase in stamping duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will serve to strengthen government efforts in the struggle to help homeless people.
This overtax - which is added to the current stamp right, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and rentals - could reach 3%.
Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 per cent of London's new constructions are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which causes prices to rise and prevents primers from taking a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who live most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a reduction in stamping rights in order to help more young people to acquire a first house.
Accusing large construction companies to maintain the property prices at a high level by taking over unutilized land, he invited Ms. May to give up quotas on affordable housing with the aim of settling the "real estate disorder" that exists in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including rent control and the removal of "unlawless" expulsions.
He would also like to give the advice of the broader powers to build new housing.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I said that I would devote my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that each new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house as well as for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become remote and the misery of the homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland Technician Jack Ross explains that his "final ambition" is to become the Scottish picker at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is pleased to meet the challenge of reborn the North-East club, which currently occupies the third place of League 1, three points from the leader.
He rallied the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I had to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But I grew up following the Scottish games in Hampden with my father and it's one thing I've never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only happen if I succeeded in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's pickers are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former engineer of Alloa Athletic states that he did not hesitate to stand behind such emblematic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "can I bring this club back to Premier League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it certainly belongs to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably not consider myself a success here if I could bring the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach in Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to rejoin a third division and transformed St Mirren, who was on the verge of the relegation, into a great winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
The take-over of Alloa was probably a real crossroads, he recalls.
"I really thought being a coach was better than playing.
It seems strange because I got out of it, that I won my life well, and that I took advantage of some appreciable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There's a lot of details to deal with every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and stress at work, but being a coach is fine for me.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I've been with my adult life."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a paint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer canycule raised the revenues of the British pubs in difficulty, but increased the pressure on the food chains.
Figures indicate that bar and pub groups increased by 2.7% of their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, CGA's consulting firm, who compiled the data, said: "The longer-than-expected insulation and involvement of England in the World Cup have made the month of July follow the model of June, where the bars had increased by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which have suffered even greater shock.
The decrease of 1.8 per cent recorded in June in the restaurant sector only began in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more similarities than the restaurants that decrease.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as the restoratives.
Looks like people just want to go out and get a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% per month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst on recreation and the RSM hotel, said: "These results have been following the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in the out-of-home market sales.
There is no wonder that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% on an average annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less convenient for food business operators and time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will give a well-deserved resume."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in implementation.
Industry sales are monitored by Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds Sterling and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, a child in five has secret accounts that he hides from his parents
According to one survey, one in five children - some of whom are only 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide with their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "principal" account to show their parents
One child in five - some of whom are only 11 - opens an account on social media that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth of the "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a "main" account cleaned to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who happened to fall on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager who was urging others to "violent me."
According to the study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11 to 18-year-olds have a double profile, half of students are grateful for their private accounts.
CSM Leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers don't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Executive Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to make use of his extensive international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from his participation in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, where he won four gold medals and is now a regular commentator of the BBC, was unable to walk after having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would recover or at what point.
It was a hard job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and now I'm doing agility exercises!

On-line advertising of milk that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company offering a milkshake compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is described as "the first silent milking in the world," Elvie, a large-public technology company, has launched an audacious advertising inspired by a music video to show the freedom its new milking machine offers to breastfeeding women.
In a herd of cows full of hay, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I betray myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's my breasts, not tits."
The refrain continues: "Pump him, pump him, feed the babies, pump him, pump him, pump him, help the women to bring the milk."
However, the advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received conflicting reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the " horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk, unless their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth," wrote one of them.
Elvie's milkshaft is quietly adapted into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It's a understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why don't you use them to advertise a handkerchief for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added: "An ad so disconnected."
Others defended advertising, for example a woman who admitted that she found the song "hilarant".
"I think it's an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still attending.
Pumping gave me the impression of being a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun commercial for mothers who pull their milk (often on their workplace or toilets) and feel like cows."
It is not an advertising that praises the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they have danced with the discrets lying in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the milk can say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie cane is completely silent, with no threads or pipes and quietly inserts into a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: "Elvie's lattice is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a daring and provocative launch.
By paralleling nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk will provide.
This is not the first time Elvie's milk is made one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski as she used this product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have quietly settled in a camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that Trump administration's harsh speeches and policies have complicated the placement of children in respondents.
Traditionally, most of the respondents were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they feared to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by leading to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Service official, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of arrested persons did not have legal records.
" Nearly 80 per cent of respondents or family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Mr.Albence.
According to the refugee authorities, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities established new rules that would require some of them to appear before the court within the month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case with regard to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons who are deemed to be non-eligible will be expelled quickly.
According to the speakers and reports that have been presented in recent months by the refugee network, the longer the children remain in detention, the more they are likely to become anxious or depressed, which may result in outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large institution such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of his or her size, according to child rights defenders.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate trauma that many have a hard time to manage.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw from the camp.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "would be dealt with accordingly."
"They must retire immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been torn from their homes.
He indicated that Damascus would continue "to carry on this sacred battle until all Syrian territories were purged" both of the two terrorist groups and of any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom form and advise both the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has over 1,000 soldiers on site.
Mualem said about refugees, that the conditions were favourable for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “producing irrational concerns” that discouraged refugees from returning.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would be concluded.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress of Idlib has led to further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the fighters of the Nusra Front, which are related to Al-Qaeda and which "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, claiming that the group's work should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and made a warning against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many Liberal viewers would probably hope, the removal and scandal led him to leave his presidency prematurely.
This would probably be "The most spectacular final of a presidency!"
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers during major evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something that we understand," commented Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC's "Designated Survival" drama series, who speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She recalls taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask him?
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has a funny value.
Of course, unlike anything on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of Roe v. Wade's case, if immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most successful viewers can afford.
And, however, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one finds himself watching for six hours an expert panel discuss how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his "Fear" book on Paul Manafort's leather vest at 15,000 dollars ("a proud garment" according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered of, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
On my side, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"If a part of what he does gives the impression of seeing a TV show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's changing teams and daily feedbacks (to fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're in the train.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at his house on the North bank of Kauai, but he was sitting inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand up, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was preparing to face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we animated all these crazy shows and people said, "It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Foreign money invades the strongest half-manda elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of the electoral districts of the Congress that allowed two licensees to dispute the same seat.
The recently restructured district of Pittsburgh was the seat of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another constituency during the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another licensee, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which heavily overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled, in January, that the former arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district gave rise to a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a win won of accuracy last March in a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the 20-point victory in the district.
Politologists have granted a slight advantage to Democrats.
The United States considered penalizing Salvador for its support for China and then withdrew
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not oppose.
Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to convene heads of US diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the department, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
But sanctions were only planned against Salvador, which received US assistance estimated at $140 million in 2017, including for drug control and development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials clearly indicated that they wanted the conference to continue, thereby ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence now wishes to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats were informed.
And the three U.S. emissaries are quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying history
The next issue could be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his inquiry into the question of a conniving Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will be required to render accounts before this body, at the time he prepares to represent himself before the electors and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many "yes", and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held him in the head and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the following carnage years.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
The Americans are currently confronted with a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed to register the president in secret and issued assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times report is inaccurate.
"What will we say if the recently requested investigation to the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confined to the Supreme Court despite accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will ask Mr Trump for accounts?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will be a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, sixty years later, sent me to light on the Sabbath candles on the table overlooking the swastika.
With this heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, confidant in front of the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive null match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the League of Europe.
A knee injury has deprived the medium of Graham Dorrans from his first participation of the season until the game null 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to achieve the best of such a result to realize exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," said the 31-year-old attacker.
"We got into the game thinking about getting something, and we left with one point.
We may have been able to take it to the end, but, overall, a null match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half-time and we returned in the second half-time and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they did a good result during their last game, however I am sure that we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and changes to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; training is quality.
Let's hope we can go ahead now, leave last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer sleep because of this fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in this survey knew clearly how they wanted them to be dealt with, few people raised the question with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do what they need to have this conversation," explained Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Branch.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children about this: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these costs.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a ransom value to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your heritage - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the passage.
Provide health care services that will allow you to identify a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a proxy for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure you pay your bills if you are unable to do so.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"There is not only the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place. ”
A man was wounded several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe

The victim, aged 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove region of Ilfracombe, in the Devon, when he was shot in his chest, belly, and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2.30 p.m. BST, as a random act.
The victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries didn't threaten his life, and the police called for witnesses.
Seisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced to the authorities, and the balance sheet should run.
As communications were paralysed, relief services were not able to receive any information from the Domgala Regency, an area located north of Palu that is more close to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
A few essential facts about Palu and Domanga, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Domalaka is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) from coast to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, and particularly of the Coastal Region of Domgala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times since a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of residences in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit west of Dongala in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years include:
2004: A major earthquake, which took place on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that has spread over 14 countries, bringing 226 000 victims on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude earthquake of 6.8 reached the south of Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and caused nearly 700 victims.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude shook the city of Padang, capital of the province of Sumatra West.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake shook the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the earthquake and the 2004 deadly tsunami.
No tsunamis were caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes shook the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was interviewed for suspicions of conjugal violence, violating a report of conjugal and arrest-resistant violence, on Saturday's release by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone from a woman's knowledge that he was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is held on a non-guaranteed bail of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it's safe" when his plea was asked, announced the network.
Palin is facing three Class A offences, which means that he may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a minor class B offence, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is under way before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of an intoxicated weapon in connection with the incident.
His partner had claimed that he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking his son's violent behaviour with PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died following the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing and the victim's balance sheet is expected to go off in the days ahead.
The earthquake occurred just off the centre of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos on social media show the point of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami broke down on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City
New York Federal Prosecutors are requesting the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York Assailant who has caused eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in that State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would have used a truck rented at Home Depot to attack a cycle track on the West Side Highway, in the Lower Manhattan road on his pedestrian and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov has "intendedly" murdered the eight victims and inflicted "intendedly" serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
These two charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this attack, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov to 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a careful preparation and premeditation," the prosecutors claimed, calling the method used by Saipov of "hate, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South New York district had not claimed the death penalty in the course of prosecution for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed to engage in conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the cold war.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been urged to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the Daesh flag in his hospital room, specified the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "of course disappointed" in the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than to accept his plea for guilt and to condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party stated that politicians should "feel pressure" of Euroseptics - as one of the Members of Theresa May suggested, he should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
Mr Peter Bone said during the Birmingham walk that the United Kingdom "would have already been released" if Mr Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the dilemma Mrs May faced to reconcile her deeply divided troops was emphasized by the Conservatives in favour of remaining in the Union, which joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty in maintaining his Czech compromise plan despite threats from those who want to get out and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The Allies stressed that they would continue their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would require Euroseptics and workers to choose between their programme and the 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted "to get rid of Chequers."
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and that he was entrusted with the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would already be out," he said.
The Member of Parliament of Wellingborough added: "I will defend the Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not been engaged in world wars to submit ourselves.
We wish to make our own legislation in our own country."
Mr. Bone pointed out the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people turned the page and wanted to stay is completely wrong."
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of the release, was also present at the walk to tell journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Anyone who is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who silence the streets and make us elected above all.
Abandon Chequers and start listening."
In a message directed to Ms. May, she added: The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honor their promises."
"Mr. Farage pointed out to the assembly that politicians should be moved to "pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They are trying to cheat the Brexit and we are saying to them today, "We will not let you out like this."
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel the pressure of our political class that is about to betray the Brexit.
We mobilize the people's army of this country that has enabled us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, pro-European followers walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of militants branded conservative banners against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of the security issues relating to the party's implementation at the beginning of the conference.
"They assure us that they are able to put in place computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to consider seriously the possibility of taking part in the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she will seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed on Saturday its future at a public assembly in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequently critical voice with regard to President Donald Trump, presented himself for the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of speculation that Trump could face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the electors in a public assembly since Trump's performance.
One participant asked whether she intended to appear in the Chair.
Warren replied that the time had come for "women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman at the head of the state."
Arrest at the time of Sims' death by bullet from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, the Baton Rouge Police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by bullet of the Wayde Sims basketball player, a LSU basketball player, Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11 a.m. h. Press conference.
On Friday, they had released a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who was on the pictures.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot in the morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims received a bullet wound in his head and got killed in his injuries," said Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul on Saturday in 247 sports.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was shot down by Simpson.
Inquired, Simpson admitted to being found at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the police station of the East Baton Rouge parish.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, competed for 32 games, of which 10 as from last season, and totaled on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 bounced by match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton headed for the world title after the team's guidelines enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became obvious as soon as Valteri Bottas qualified in advance Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that Mercedes's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and frowned Hamilton on the flank while defending his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the booths first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the tower at the peloton's tail, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes passed through the booths a later round and found behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the advantage after a wheeled action that saw Ferrari's pilot leave the inside to counter the risk of resisting after a double attempt to defend in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21 years.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tires to aim for a speeding arrival and forward Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived at the stands at the 44th tower, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight towers, Raikkonen slammed fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valteri has done a great job all weekend and has been a real gentleman who let me go.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee, but he argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the Senate these last days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"By seeing the disclosures and the leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking of the senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter describing the allegations against Kavanaugh in detail last July, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the gathering: "I'll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to resume power by all means.
You see wickedness, wickedness, they care about who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control," said the president in Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars wiped out their defeat of Friday in Elite League against the Giants of Belfast by kicking back the match 5-3 in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score thanks to two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought equality back home before Dwyer gave the Giants the advantage.
François Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen writes two goals, ensuring their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday evening in Belfast, after having been caught.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants who triumphed during the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage to the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass by Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the four minutes later.
During a first well-loaded period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt went to the service of Cownie at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advance before the first break when he struck his second goal of the evening toward the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard again matched with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus ensuring the victory for his team by marking a fifth goal at the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes during their next match Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board a plane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died and ensures that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many others disappeared after an important earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and many people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Grande refused to abandon his post in the tower violently rocked at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he felt she was going down.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirat, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the country's disaster reduction agency indicating that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to fade because many bodies were still under the debris and a large number could not be dried," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency.
Waves measuring up to six metres have ravaged Palu who will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide help and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are piled up everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?," CNN said.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Aeroplane Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man disappeared after the crash of a plane in the lagoon.
The airline that managed the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew members evacuated the flying aircraft safely.
Air Niugini stated in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to more specific requests for information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local ships took part in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the aircraft hit the water by attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline stated on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses felt that the plane had crossed the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes stated that he and the others had been able to slip into the water until the aircraft's emergency exits were coming down.
he claimed that the on-board officers had panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that the sailors working close to the improvement of a wharf had also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the mainland before the aircraft flowed in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
The Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 persons have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the timing of the night when the woman was burned alive
The charge adjourned on Saturday in the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the area of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls from a cell phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night the accused died.
Rowlett indicated that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones that indicated that Telllis and he was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he had pretended to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another incoherence lies in the fact that Telllis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the SMS, calls and contact details of Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense must begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury during the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by impersonating its music of positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?!
A New York nanny continues a couple in court for having fired her after a "racist" text
A New York nanny continued a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after having received an error message from the mother who complained that she was "a still Black".
The couple refuse to be racist, and equate the prosecution with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his dismay in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new noun, was Black on his arrival for his first day of work.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE A NOIRE," writes Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding his gaffe, “sick at ease,” Plasco-Flaxman sent Mrs. Maurice, explaining that their former Nunou, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Philippine instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work, then returned home by a Uber.
Now Maurice continues the couple in court in order to obtain compensation for her return and claims a $350 per day in respect of the six-month home service for which she was initially hired but without a contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do that kind of things," she said at the Post Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that he could not be trusted after he had done something wrong.
"My wife had sent him something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone with whom you were rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your new baby?
Let's see!"
Associating the trial to an "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you pursue someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," added the business banker.
While the file is still under way, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blame them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify themselves to a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It's hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very fun, knowing what we know about the enormous success of Paddington."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small teddy bear, would remain optimistic about the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a taste "twelfth-mother" after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and adds that his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he was not a pretentious man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we are proud of him, even though it is not really his own realization.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
At the landing, her daughter had been taken urgently to the Louis Pastor 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, and we did not expect it to happen," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors had given her to maintain her heart rate were slowly exhausting and getting out of her system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to take the shot."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving of her daughter, rode on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this huge sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Depressed women deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted, on a Welsh bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm forced to feel everyday," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm constantly afraid there's a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if he is a friend.
Don’t keep quiet - you have to talk. ”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"He didn't say he felt down, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we saw his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She said that her death represented a huge trauma for them, but they must get out of it: "It's tearing up for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh involved as the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited investigation in time, limited in scope - maybe we could bring some unity," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would "fall" into a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will take place only in five weeks, 6 November. If, as planned, the Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called on the honourable senators and asked them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
We do not know yet whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to defuse the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of "fall" deserters under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un, seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that 1,127 desertions took place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing fares demanded by passengers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of the Northern deserters will finally be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the very protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang in the context of talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had been pending until now.
This happened after the historic June meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the broad lines, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, imposed no progress on US sanctions since then.
"In the absence of trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to undertake unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi qualifies Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", and asserts that he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and declared he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview given on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I could not help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee of Magistrates last Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes failed to shout and choke by referring to his family and his school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations of " grotesque and coordinated murder" organized by disappointed Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he is discrediting himself with these statements and the way he took it to the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to detain Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and whether the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also unfit to sit in the court where he is at present," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
He also added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh addressed the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect what we say: "It's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribbe, months and years of anger that overflow, and it can't get her out without crying.
"We cry when we're upset," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere, who told me that she too cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I found it brilliant."
The tears are allowed as exutory to anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I found myself crying from an inexpressible rage, was that I had been seized by the skin of the neck by an old woman - a cold director who had always a little frightened - who had led me into a stairway.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They believe you are sad and happy because they have had you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was taken into an extra-husband affair on board a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of introducing herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a maturely thought-out decision," she entrusted me with laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone called it "Blanche-Neige and the Sept Nains".
As the campaign was very advanced, it had slowed down in fundraising, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it had raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men were only counting on her to provide $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch official campaigns, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she felt uncomfortable about it.
"You would have thought I was nervous," Ms. Schroeder recalled about the reaction of the press to her.
"You would have believed that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
Did she cry?
How the United States-China Trade War could benefit Beijing
The first rescues of the U.S.-China trade war have been shocking, and although the battle is far from over, a conflict between countries could benefit in Beijing over the long term, according to experts.
President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The largest increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth US$ 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion), thus charging half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Every time, Beijing has responsibly responsibly recently hit customs duties of between 5 and 10 per cent of US$60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will be empty by now.
Backing back to Washington is to yield to the demands, but publicly giving up to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, the experts believe that if Beijing can play its role correctly, the pressures of the American trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions conducive to a slow economic down in one or the other of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than the observers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research associate that focuses on Asia, the thinking group of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks assistance to rebuild this devastated country by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Mualem, said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations considers that more than 5.5 million Syrians had deserted the country since the war began in 2011.
Six more million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of that devastated country.
He pointed out, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the 14.5-point bar to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who found himself in difficulty during most of the tournament, pushed his kick in the water in the 16th hole in par-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was separated 5-4 by the least well-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, leaned 2 and 1 in front of the English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the European Champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today, it's stronger than me.
It was an exciting year.
I'm so grateful Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cut back.
What matters is the team, and I'm glad I could help it," Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, on Sunday last.
"I feel incredible pride, I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost his four games in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 as a career in Ryder Cup.
Surprising statistic for one of the biggest golfers of all time, which has picked up 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time all weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf for the duration of the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance with regard to his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a certain time when we put pressure on Europe.
We've quit.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have all played very well.
We're going to get together, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to bow.
We've gotten ourselves over it."
Point info on red tide: Low concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report of the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in certain areas of the Tampa Bay region.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which is a cause for fear of decreasing concentrations.
