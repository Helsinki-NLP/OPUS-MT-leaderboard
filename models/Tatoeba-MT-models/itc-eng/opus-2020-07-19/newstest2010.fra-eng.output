Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American president of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
Among other things, the $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy schedule.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet his summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, but only the third who will be awarded the prize in the Committee's very presence.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award.
The President does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at present.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to emphasize.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
It intends to donate to charitable works, but it has not yet decided on which.
His program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, feeling that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A nature defender accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police charged the president of the Litoměřice nature protector Society as blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in return for his call, said Alena Romová, spokesman for the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Société des protectors de la nature de Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and at risk up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting beans are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinks packs, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting buckets at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before you find the right buckets.
I don't mean we wouldn't pick up all the waste in Brno.
But I feel that our city's second largest city councillors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the Stone Age of Waste Sorting not only because citizens can still choose only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of buckets dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle into the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires mainly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues don't like it, but it seems to me very little.
Not to mention that in other neighborhoods of the city it's not a safe either.
So to finish, many of my friends don't sort their waste.
Per paresse.
It makes them a trot to get to the buckets.
I'm not surprised about them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to throw out a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't notice any colored bean Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, isn't it?!
It is likely that ecology and a so-called aestheticism do not interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a first-class hockey league place that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying a few extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after dragging a moment on the Internet.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the entire region of South Moravia.
Paroubek's budget removed pension and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the Government's opinion, farmers or civil servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or savings on housing.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the government's borrowing for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's only bringing problems back later, mining the ground," Janota said.
It must be known that the interest to be paid is increasingly high on money and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all of the left that has now increased: firefighters, educators, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of higher government debt - next year there will be no 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will increase more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenses.
The State will need money to pay for it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also require five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of electors.
These are mainly already decided and started sections that cannot be modified to possibly reduce costs.
At least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 large construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the custody of Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very rightly - it will be able to obtain in the dividends of ČEZ (supply supplier and distributor of electricity), which the State has in large part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement retirement accounts, or to serve as a reserve for the reform of pensions that are preparing.
In addition, this tip increases the real deficit in the budget to 5.7 percent of the GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crimes, even the savings of housing, has declined by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, Janota notes.
The Minister will then have to save on the side of the department or, at the worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of one hundred million in the state fund project of two billion, which must be monitored online for each administration's expenditure.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would be carried out, Janota was warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
Projects that have been revealed appear promising.
Just one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American VMware company, which deals primarily with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alter between them, you can differentiate them into staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones has nothing to do with fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is on the rise.
VMware now works with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Desert tracks do not pose a problem only to uplift operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to set up free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's.
We have a lot of visits on our website.
Internet users go through the offers, ask for the prices but do not dare to book for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, using the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend New Year's dream of Špindler, it's better not to hesitate to book.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation comes next, then you can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hotels offer only one week's stay for the New Year.
I think they're going to try a little longer to place them, but they're going to pass them too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," said Jandura.
The Vrchlabí Tour Agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas week for the moment, it is not sold completely.
It remains free, let's say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some cheap last minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February go as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, the interest for winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," thinks Schiefert.
On the other hand, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for the New Year as well as Christmas.
There is great interest during the holiday of Janvier des Poles and February also sells itself well," informs Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at ninety percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at the moment.
February is a little lower for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow again indicated the director of Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Krkonoše hotels, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be fresher and if there are precipitations, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later on, time should be warmed, inform Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition is mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of the sage, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he himself considered to be quite simple.
When he ended up letting his doctrine so ardently awaited, it turned out that he had picked it up in carbon paper from Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not happy to use in the text even several times the expression "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, who is, in addition, to use the title of the January 2007 Bush speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by civil war as "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
However, the following months have shown that Bush's strategy, which was the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful so that newspapers today do not speak of Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a final situation far more favourable than could be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will reproduce
Again, it was the campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the restraints of the White House despite the habit of subordination.
He called for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months but without a better option, he cheated on at least the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to remove the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it had about 10,000 originally.
What brings the most problems throughout Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to remove the armies of Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this whole process in three years' time. Obama's entire doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt the fact that a half increase will bring the same fruit as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is marked by the opposite - no one can count on, and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their day-to-day leadership according to what arranges them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain powder in the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity in relation to reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "early state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy makes her voluntarism perplexed.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only become worse and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for their "early return to the house" will bring there a true miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect confession of the US defeat.
NATO's last summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem through the use of military force.
For example, it will be necessary to respond to this when, according to Obama, America is coming to the victorious withdrawal of Afghan troops.
However, each solution of this type will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only Rustine for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it to plan a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Bank leaders Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums
High-ranking employees from the American Goldman Sachs bank will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced this to respond to the strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 leading leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell until five years.
The actions may be withdrawn from the leaders if they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link salaries with long-term performances on Wall Street.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning to be taken, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of the company JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank became the target of critics after nearly $17 billion was set aside for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total premium will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the coming financial crisis, strong bank sector premiums have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it was counting on a single tax of 50 percent on bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel prizes in all fields except physics
There are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in both technical and literary disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German author of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two U.S. biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received the Nobel Prize in Medicine with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry price was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a winner this year was physics.
This award was given today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with William Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary reward.
It reaches 10 million Swedish crowns in each category. (about 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The highly awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over this afternoon to Oslo in Norway to President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward, since it was only at the beginning of his journey and that he was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is indispensable to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is planning to resign. Klaus invited him to Château
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who will make his stay to the government because of his disagreement with the State budget for the coming year as voted by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota at the firm will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticized the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which is growing further in the public finances crisis.
President Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to budget legislation that will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies validated the left-wing proposals on money transfers on Wednesday and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government was repudiating the proposals of the Social Democrats for the indirect increase in the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, which questioned the future of Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the SDO, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by the MPs, removes the savings package passed by the Fischer government and that it has to indict the government's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but does not force anything, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that policies have long overlooked the "serious problem" of the "irrefrable deficiency" of public finances.
There is now, in his view, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could rely on a wider consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is faltering and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, ODS and Greens obviously no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dramatic truths".
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is faltering and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD has successfully qualified the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticisms of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, the South Africans say that Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu's new film will expose to the world a lot of things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story speaks of sport, of race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded for the Oscars, incarnates Nelson Mandela's life film, untiringly fighting the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a ninety-first-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate her in the movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally..
The sixty-two-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in the drama Million Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of boxing, for example, has incarnated the leader of a movement against slavery becoming himself a slave, a president of the fictional USA, even God in the film Evan Tout-Power but never someone else alive and so important for so many people as he is Mandela.
The former South African man was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in favor of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invaincu and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela recently elected knows that his country remains and is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people with sport and decides to join rugby players who are among the outsiders at the global level.
The South African team will finally make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to large screen.
I didn't have any other purpose to play that role in order to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, talking like him.
The actor stated that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dine with him, to be behind bars before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to hold his hand.
I realized that when I held your hand, I recovered from your energy, it was transmitted, and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard environment of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pineaar was: 'I look a lot bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the actual models, Invictus under the hood of the director Eastwood received positive opinions and even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Todd McCarthy's film critic of Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very successful film."
In film evaluations on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway was observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava"-type missile which was originally the pride of the Russian army gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "the missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was conducted at the beginning normally.
It's only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the aircraft.
It was clearly the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be set on fire from a moving and immersing vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object probably was by a defective "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the avalanche affected only the third.
In previous cases, engines have experienced failure on the first floor.
Although none of the test releases went through without affidavits, the Ministry of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and thus always states that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a 51-year-old professional game.
The world's former champion, the Olympic champion and Stanley Cup's holder will lend his hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry already during the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who completed his 40-year career in 1998, is the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details about the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov became the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and achieved 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he has twice released gold at the Olympic Games, seven World Championships, he has triumphed at Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he twice held Stanley Cup.
He has been a member since 2001 of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancelled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions have reported a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk at Hyundai factory confirmed it.
However, management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday that has been worked this year.
We can't give up our production plan, it's essential, that's why volunteer overtime was offered on Saturday 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
Sedmička.cz site reported that the company offered a 400-czech crown bonus to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
He will also be assigned a postponerary for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way its employees are motivated in exchange for overtime.
They either receive the supplement for extra hours, or they can place a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their late-year holidays indicated Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in union comments and claims as workers who spontaneously quit production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work almost two overtime hours each day in more than eight hours.
Trade unions will cancel the strike after the agreement is signed.
The next negotiation between the management of the automotive plant and the trade unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said Wednesday they were ready to stop the strike in the event of agreement on their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation at the plant ended on Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously got into a strike because of the time-consuming overtime.
They also protested against the poor conditions of wages and so-called whippings.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the requirements for car production.
In the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also asked that workers who had ceased production should not be subject to any sanctions.
Trade unions call on the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (about € 209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last year in November.
It has manufactured approximately 80,000 vehicles up to September of this year, with a capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
This reality, in some cases, takes the top on the fact that the combination does not deal as intensively with the current variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
However, the life of the sick can be radically prolonged through a combination of medications that prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs have no effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans are acting on the protein responsible for the increase of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are an assembly of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far, and that is why they could overcome the resistance problem.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links to virus proteins.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are made up of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a HIV protein that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, there would be no mature virus infectious particles.
If HIV is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, explains researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their studies published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (cf. table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in evidence as well as in its resistant variants from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborans is not as strong as on clinical medicines, but it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which common medicines are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to examine further to address the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina  in the structural biology laboratory director of the organic chemistry and biochemistry institute and the molecular genetic institute of the Academy of Sciences.
Debates of the European Parliament
The President of the ODS (Democrat Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek has qualified as the "trafficking" the budget ratified for the following year and he believes that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the SDO's remarks for drastic verdict.
He said to take time to analyze.
ODS spokesperson Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party was obviously no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to take part in the House of Deputies' support for the minority concerned with combating the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and the democratic social groups in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with the proposed changes of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The Chamber has increased the amount of money for employees' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance with the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, obeying the Government's wish to see how a modified budget is a less bad option than an interim budget.
Deception and uselessness
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to quit her duties in the event of ratification of the proposals for amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota met on Monday with the Prime Minister after his transition to government:
At the same time, he indicated that he wondered if he was going to remain in his office.
Its disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of ČSSD, who have imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not at issue.
This is the case of the head of Fischer government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDO did nothing harmful, highlighted Topolánek in a text communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the Deputy Ministers of certain ministries are demanding TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign from the struggle against the deficit in public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently in the Chamber."
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of democrats.
I didn't think about it and once it's going to be on the agenda, then I'll devote myself to it, said from the Chamber to the journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS went backwards at the Prime Minister's request.
At the same time, Nečas pointed out that the SDO would probably have voted against the modified budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democratic MPs to allow the budget to vote.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, did he react to the question of whether the ODS had not been blamed by the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have failed.
I already knew when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevisation of the Chamber and destruction of everything that was positive, so Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new schedule of the ČD, there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
The Czech Railways will delete or limit certain less heavily loaded express or regional trains from 13 December on the other hand, and will strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will fall to the date of entry into force of the new two percent timetables compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, people in the Ostrava region will have more links to the capital, the Railways will add a pendulum.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be fewer quick trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest reduction in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region of eight percent in total, on the other hand, Prague and its surroundings can rejoice with an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the traffic of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced to only a few days a week.
Among the major transformations, one can see the introduction of a new direct Milovice line in Prague: for the time being Milovice's inhabitants must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distance lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main train station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will start in two hours.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13th.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the railways next year at a total of four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate at almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have again signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not used a price increase of the vast majority of transport securities.
Changes will only affect tickets for a day ČD Net and low price eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the journey, while until then it was valid among cities of a region to choose and was at a single price of 160 crowns.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children were released
The rebels today removed 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP that informed them, but spoke of the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields during a police leak.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP Agency, the rebels belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first followed the raiders as a result of the violence caused by the settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre linked to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province was arrested following suspicions of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in the American halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates some of the life of the former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the global apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the film coming into the halls, reviews and audience feedback are heard.
Nelson Mandela
Of his full name Nelson Rohlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvesu in South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov prize for his freedom of mind, then in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the break-up of the world of football, and on the other hand because the media are driven by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are, for the time being, rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles in which Hollywood stars "pavan" are taking place.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film by taking back his own words.
I dreamed of this long-term role and I was well prepared.
I have also repeatedly met in person Nelson Mandela to be able - as it is said - to recover from his energy, he indicated during the first film official in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember yourself through the film the personality and message of Mandela.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns each individual he has added.
Bringing the National Rugby Team T-shirt
The film based on the history of the novel of the British writer John Carlin is the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave his creation to the people depicting the South African human rights defender during his mandate to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries to collect two racial groups from a long-divided population during the film and Nelson Mandela in 1995 was wearing the National T-shirt of the South African team on the lawn of the world, which South Africa had then won.
Mandela was long ovated 14 years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white people.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in bringing people together again in one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the situation in South Africa will improve.
South African whites, however, are skeptical as recently entrusted in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flame in the Louny region
A fire covered in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukaš Marvan, spokesperson for Ústí firefighters, there are six units operating on fire.
They were originally counting on letting the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and turned off the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to Pavla Mandátova's spokesperson, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission package.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, Čeps did not know anything similar and that such incidents were isolated.
Electrical power supplies have not been interrupted, says the spokesperson of ČEZ for the Bohème du Nord Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution points with 67 transformers transferring electric energy from transport sets to distribution sets and lines paths of a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura will file complaints for defamation against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, the owner of Student Agency, will file today a complaint for defamation against three democratic social prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the Prefect of the Olomoc Martin Tesařík region.
Jančura reported it in Dvacet minute of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to exploit regional railways in some regions.
However, all regions have concluded long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked and claimed that we were doing the ends of the mouth, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So there's nothing left for us but to defend ourselves.
In exchange for slander about the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that he had evidence that no region had complied with European law.
We are therefore preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the complaint filed by Mr. Jančura represents the continuation of his media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and for his person.
Of course I am willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertising that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he counted on it after New Year.
He explained that the campaign will aim at corruption in the broadest sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing an invitation to tender.
According to Jančura, such a way of doing so is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats from a Member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I don't know who it is, but I won't say his name, said Jančura today at Radiožurnál.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcals will reverse the old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voting is already taking place, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Experts also see clear in the vaccination process.
New vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid for themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcals.
Yet the parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of younger children requires four doses.
Experts believe that each year health insurance spends 300 to 450 000 crowns in vaccine doses.
They, however, save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
So far, the State has spent about 500,000 crowns per year on all vaccinations of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of middle ear inflammation but also serious infections including mening and blood poisoning.
According to hospital investigations, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age from pneumococcal infections occurred.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries introduced refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From Janvier, it must be regulated by insurance and voluntary.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský Association indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcals.
At an international conference at which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad we could have imposed at least this.
I think this is a direction now to follow, Kalovský said.
But the Department of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not looking at him for the moment, said his spokesperson Vlastimil Sršeň.
Vaccination optionally has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Paediatric Society, recognizes that a vaccination based on volunteerata's defects.
If all children were vaccinated, a decrease in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making vaccination optional," however Cabrnochová said.
Experts expect that by next year more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a break since it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not by the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free funds for prevention, thereby saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This, however, is related to the concerns of the paediatric practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to purchase vaccines by insurance, and doctors receiving them in the same way as other state-provided vaccine products.
Some Members feared, however, that this would allow insurance to "deduct health insurance amounts".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to repay them.
It is estimated that pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It'll be a long way from being easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Vol de musée"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings for a value of $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interrogated while he was loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical skin to force the museum entrance to the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reporting the News Agency Associated Press (AP).
AP cited a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Fr. Frazetta Jr claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the tables to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies having given such permission, the Agency said.
Labour defends the increase in the budgetary tax.
The Ministers defended the increase in the tax and reduction of expenditure announced in the Pre-Budget report, despite the criticism of opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that it was serious about the reduction of the deficit by reporting its decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the lightning from low wages and average wages.
Its main proposals include an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a ceiling of 1% on public salaries from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
Trade unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession that they are not responsible for and warned that "problems" were announcing.
The reduction in social security - which will allow about GBP 3 billion per year - has put the world of companies in anger, because he believes it is a job tax while the objective should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers bonuses
The increase in corporate profits tax for small companies has been abandoned
Tax reductions for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning GBP 30,000 per year will lose GBP 90 per year and a person earning GBP 40,000 per year will lose GBP 190, while a person earning GBP 10,000 per year will win GBP 110 more.
The Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 was "hard decisions" but stressed that 60% of the additional taxes would weigh on the first 5 per cent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, rejected an increase in the tax and pointed out that a decrease in expenditures was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident and the growth of the economy would start again at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the borrowing would be 3 billion GDP above the estimate.
"Hasn't been a chance"
The Conservatives who will launch on Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against Labour's "debt crisis" claimed that the GBP 789 billion loan project over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, highlighting "cyclically" difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to be held in June 2010.
"They presented nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
"The important announcements will be made after the election, whatever the winner"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from the forthcoming reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would result in a faster and greater reduction in the deficit.
But Lib Dems claimed that the money collected through the increase in taxes and the decrease in expenditure would be used to support next year's spending rather than to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "constructed on the wind".
Nick Robinson, a BBC political editor, said that the announcements calendar - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April next year, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, with money being recovered only the following year.
However, the Labour Committee insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers had not published the details of spending beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that restrictions on public spending would start to feel only in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Estudes Fiscales) affirmed that the Chancellor's figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, including potential transportation, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only deferred," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the election, whatever the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report.
FBI Investigation of "American Arrests in Pakistan" · Global Voices
The FBI investigates the arrest, in Pakistan, of five American reporters, suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid in a home in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab , announced the US Embassy in Pakistan at the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sought information about these individuals.
Three of them are presented as of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesperson, said the agency had heard about the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and if it really is the students who are missing," she said.
Pakistan's Embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them.
She said that the house was already monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
State Secretary Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, reported the press agency Reuters, but stated that the United States had to "collaborate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been carried away from home by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the report of the Amnesty International Association.
the report presents "repeats of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the June presidential elections.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its lack of respect for human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's disputed election led to the greatest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Twelve were sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claimed that at least five persons were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, correspondent of the BBC in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, said our correspondent.
"Fausse confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, always in blood and half conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the candidate losing the election, Mehdi Karroubi, affirmed that demonstrators detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also referred to the case of a former prisoner who said he was locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform Bristol's site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 skiers and snowboarders in competition for in-kind prices.
Upstairs of Brandon Hill Park, a small tramp preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the top view of the track was beautiful but that it was rather intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining in the background.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be left at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book by the author, "Why the French don't like scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for some fifteen years and whose effects still make itself felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a much wider and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim Spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the discussions between teachers and students on the issues most relevant to them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or the mayor (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to Muslim youth?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to get a loan?
These are practical issues, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the very end.
The Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers of a purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia that today is a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the guardian intellectual elite so virulent of secularity) were actually engaged in pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared with Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than increasing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the Great North, the polar bear.
He knew of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter, then brave 14-year-old aspiring who had only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming beside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show assembled 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are generally one millionth of the area required for an adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae that were growing in its thick fur.

Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose on the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians on motorcycles use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the most northern waters of these two nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a thrilling glimpse of what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherics nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of changes.
There's no need to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th years, the pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the source of the ice cap.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the underlying relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the largest of the work is done by hardened men, camping in cold.
Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice tax system, formed by the saltwater nets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who have deposited crowns on graves in Arlington
First class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus trip to deposit a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday mornings to deposit crowns on the Veterans' tombs, in different sections of Arlington Ceremony's cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make every year travel, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the victims of United Airlines flight 93 to Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given over $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
70-year-old Charleen Hunt of Westminster said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embroidered in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and the large hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, as they are not often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children were playing and the couples were holding their hands, wearing fresh pine crowns on gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Closely, he was planning silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are humiliated.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Some people cried without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others thought to see the small black and white information cards, embedded in the wet soil for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She was a member of Zanesfield in Ohio and had taken eight hours to come to the tomb of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in the battle in July.
Nobody should ever forget what we're free of... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, and affirmed the services of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on client projects such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husband and are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to go to receive awards, but the authorizations have always been refused.
The detention of an American national may increase the tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which continues to be a "mild" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward through concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can make the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or an employee's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press member of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick elder brother.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries began to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities found an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five North Virginia men to Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, hoping that this case would enable an important network of terrorist recruiters who are searching for radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after they discovered them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Having arrived in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, al-Qaida home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistani Secret Services who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince Al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the banned mountains of the north-east become a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered to be infiltrated agents.
That is why they have been rejected, said a representative of the authorities who has expressed himself on condition to keep the anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into the camps of al-Qaida when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are interrogated by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining the people to whom they trust.
Since the September 11, 2001, U.S. secret services have been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of custodians, refusing entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their advertising value.
However, Evan Kohmann, expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups also need to pay more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept because US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model than so many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen ask for "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked on the streets, here on Saturday, calling for greater action on the climate of the negotiators working in the palace of the city's Bella Convention Center Congresses.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000 but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists have lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings, downtown.
At this time when little has happened during discussions on the United Nations-sponsored climate, thousands of activists have walked through the city, deploying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, saying 'The Earth says it has enough'.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to her mother's home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the devastating problems that the country is facing due to the impact of climate change already taking place."
That's one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to put the word forward and to appeal to the world's leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or owned pocket knives.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or owned pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep the anonymity due to its involvement in climate discussions, activists who wore black masks and clothing have lit up several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Within the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that demonstrators have failed to wake up the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative for the climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: "In fact, that is something I didn't realize.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and of the various sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal tenacious differences between races
Last week's federal report on results in mathematics brought good news to public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more advanced in the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Education Progress) are the persistent gap between the results of Afro-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in WashingtonD.C. increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, with only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average result of whites was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view over a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the teaching group director Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in district education.
I do not leap for joy for one or two won points, said Kwame R. Brown (Democrat relative), Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Basic School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the message of test results is that the city's middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students from the end classes of the elementary cycle and the beginning of college that did not integrate the foundations of reading earlier into their school careers and are sufficiently late from their peers.
Every day, the math program, for Kindergarten (Maternal) classes in Grade 6 (6th) emphasizes the games and experiences of real life, as they were put in place in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these lower-level students than the one in the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of NAEP ask whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall performance of the system while providing money and resources for less successful schools in order to reduce the gap.
It's a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest districts of Washington.
Therefore, this targeting may have political implications that hamper this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, wherever they are from, can be assured that their children can obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap in success was the duration of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, Janey said, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "start point" to get an increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, comes down and blinks a moment in the eyes of the white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other class 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where school fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of a new student who was impressed than enthusiastic.
That's where I'm going to study! She exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them toward the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? says she's a dreamer, when she was given the low law teacher ratio - a student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit the children during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question still arises for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who have left the high school where they have become parents in their early years, they are also hundreds of thousands of students to benefit from university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic of the "second generation" over fifty-four years of his studies in high school -- a remarkable success if one considers that both of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they open the way for the next generations to play an important role in the country's labour force.
Researchers who study batting claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an inherent need to succeed.
Many parents also have high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university -- in particular, if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate in the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support to these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared) , it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when low-income family students are middle school (school) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi Oil has agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, which has been invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies went out with a stake in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only one who had an auction lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies opened the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet site of information.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability while U.S. military forces withdrew, have stopped American oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, the analysts say.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and gave it their technical advice, distributed empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more contracts than other companies and has divided with significant participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesperson of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected auction companies made offers that were then compared to the bar fare that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the leading organizers of al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan.
It seems that an American missile hit along the border with Afghanistan killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, they declared Friday from the U.S. counter-spionage authorities.
If the information is confirmed, that would be the second deadly attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles thrown into their cars on Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that missiles had been fired by a pilot without a pilot of the type used by the CIA within the anarchist tribal border of Pakistan.
They drove a white car, headed to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a Pakistani civilian secret services member, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority stated that local suspects precipitated on-site and quickly confiscated what remained of "totally dechivated bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was one of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of Al-Qaida military organizers leading the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistan's territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of Al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said that Somali had progressed rapidly in the al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the American general public, but that does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major character of al-Qaida or second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of the CIA drone attacks has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also impatience killing the suspected informants, says the site.
The United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The United Nations Special Envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate of allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure came as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said that he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and force the other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a Kabul telephone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military Powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he was not resigning but that he would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives say that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is a citizen Italo-Switzerland who recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French man who previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of mass election fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that Galbraith's accusations -- which had been thanked -- "have been detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism with regard to international election observation."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN Heads to authorize his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that he was not assigned to the mission to Afghanistan, saying that this would give them greater confidence in how their money was spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy UN employment regulations were hampering his ability to bring new talents.
The United Nations rules are such as I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary to the Defence, Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world's great powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a midwife of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a one-week visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a breakthrough. ̈
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I've learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it's the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He stated that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesperson of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme in full conformity with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has put in place such an agreement, a way to build confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Iran has since shown itself to be far away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's crackdown on some of the proposals by the international community for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set the deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to the proposals before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich Kurdish oil region to meet with the Chiefs of the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays in American plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops, from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm the Kurds' anxiety about suspended withdrawal. American authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown up with propaganda posters telling them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "A baby too, it's an additional grave".
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the ageing of the population, radically changed direction this summer and started encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
There is no second left," said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has an eight-month son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child's policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good play and spoiled, called the "small emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7% of the population in 2020 to 31.1% by 2050, is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in wealthy coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission of Shanghai and Family Planning stated that fertile couples should have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "also old - but not as rich, however - as the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
The Chinese policy of the only child is, without doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist Government, drafted in the constitution of the country in 1978.
Couples who transgress this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination at the workplace.
The Chinese authorities attributed it to the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced the abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women of a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys and girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened a lot of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planners and volunteers to meet with couples, at home, and slip prospectus under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of the family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although leaders in a rural town in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in couples' requests for a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The town of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the town of Caolu, Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to take care of their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would love to have two children and are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly believe that the policy of the single child is a problem of rights, Yang, a construction engineer whose woman is seven months pregnant by the first child of the couple, said.
It's true, we steal the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she wanted only one child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and had the habit of everyone caring for us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it more acutely.
For couples working at two, middle-class, who lower the birth rate, it is said, it is necessary to be selfishly successful.
People aged 20 or 30 have grown up seeing their parents fighting in the early times of capitalist China and don't want to have themselves this lifestyle, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you have to write his CV to get a place in the best nursery."
Most of her friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- has returned under the fires of the ramp Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden, in the coming years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases has highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it has clarified the path to be taken.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in time-consuming negotiations, with over 100 leaders from all over the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
The text, prepared by a United Nations special working group, does not state how many rich countries would provide to the poor to support climate warming in the long term and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process," said John Coequyt, Representative to Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on United Nations climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States for Climate Negotiation rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by the industrialized countries, compared with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming tougher against China than the Bush administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from major developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei stated that the US lead negotiator, either "good sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help financially China to fight climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, defects have appeared both in the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States complaining about their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major issuers responsible for their actions.
It is truly a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put pressure on obtaining a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants said that negotiations would lead to a minimum of political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the action of small island states has "put a political pressure on the complete political process", in part by what they are now unified and that they call on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in place before the heads of governments reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister have come down from their aircraft and have gone ahead in the Bella Center building to attend open-ended meetings and briefings in order to be able to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des congresses daily -- of guitar activists present night performances mocking countries that believe they betray themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the Great Court," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President of the World Conservation International Policy.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome of Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a blow of whistle will go through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of the transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and would link the major hubs of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The small lost holes will become flourishing suburban cities, the length of business travel will be much less long, and the passage of the aircraft and the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable planning battle, and the fear of environmental hazards, are likely to slow the British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to carry out a feasibility report for the government, will render its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a larger-speed network going north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninsulas to Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle up Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is over, the time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given space constraints, it is expected that an existing railway station will be expanded to receive the network at high speed.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be obliged to drive off high-speed lines on the existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This seems to be the best solution to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for the revolution of the rail.
The taxpayers reimbursed the GBP 75,000 loan for the Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the principal member of Parliament Tory, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to pay back the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency house.
The party leader who was endorsed by David Cameron to complain that the members of the parliament were "maintained", increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build a oak extension at his second house in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of books per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not interrogated by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that complaints could not be "lighter or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of the parliament, is the owner of a two-storey house in a village in his district of Rutland - Melton.
The neighbouring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Commons, concerning his prior arrangements for borrowing.
The Committee found him guilty last month of any charges of non-compliance, after an inquiry into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of the borrowing of GBP 271,406 of his property in London at the house of his electoral district he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of the parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The variable standard interest rate RBS increased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as head of the ghost cabinet in September, after a covert journalist filmed him saying that the members of the parliament had to survive "on the budget" after the expenses scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on the budget" and you are treated as "of the m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more sacredly, but I didn't."
The member of the parliament, millionaires since his former position as a oil dealer, began to explain his spending, in May, after he appeared to have requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fee office that this could "be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the form of £ in the lawn of M Duncan, to protest after it was revealed that he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fee office and by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with the theft or development or use of the rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It could not be clearer or simpler."
Faithful, all come and see Brighton's Avent calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new means of promotion for winter months, an interactive Avent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration by creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for every day of December, using Noel songs as theme.
The event started on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 6:30, every day, with pastries and hot wine served for free.
The Noel songs selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-remunerated priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said, "We wish religion to be closer to people in a post-credited society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Avent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we are trying to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police have made hundreds of inquiries.
At least 30 thousand people, according to the police, about a hundred thousand according to the organizers, walked into the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, to reach an agreement that could enter into force by Friday, 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making "the political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the courthouse, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke windows with paving and hammers, found a journalist from the AFP.
Anti-emission police intervened immediately without a housekeeper.
In total, the police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, essentially according to the members of the Blacks Blocs, these ultraviolent clusters, which in particular were illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were asked "without distinction", pointing out that a hundred of them "were always held on the street on Saturday night's "lugged and held in position despite extreme cold".
Parliament's party, the courtroom, quite a good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building, without looking to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the speakers planned, before a candle-guard with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by car and by the large cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky-blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Earth's Friends, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to claim ecological debt compensation for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep telling ourselves: we have time, estimated the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, streams where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992, with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alter-globalist movement approached environmental organizations.
The French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, has given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, planting bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, gatherings of a few hundred demonstrators have also been held to call for strong action against climate change.
In France, events organized by the network "350" gathered several hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The Abkhazia separatist elected his president, Georgia denounces a "flash"
The Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called upon to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first interim results were to be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in high school, including the outgoing president Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, who condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "reports that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 people, while the rest of the world considers it an illegal part of Georgia occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which resulted in several thousand deaths, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is prepared to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who said he voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to the polling office in a school in Soukhumi, the capital, in a nice white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the president in this region to the sumptuous landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are located in this small territory of 216,000 people.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, district leader Beslan Archba has reserved a warm welcome for Russian officials who have come to monitor the electoral process.
We, the Abkhaze people, are grateful, said at a small ceremony, in reference to the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims neither to support the current power nor to oppose it.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate meets this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the live one, have interviewed nearly 700 people on the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about a hundred thousand according to the organizers, walked into the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes the delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament's party, the cortege, a generally good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without looking to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the speakers planned, before a candle-guard with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the courthouse, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, brick and hammered, broke windows, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-Emote police soon circled them and intervened without homelessness, throwing several of them on the ground.
The police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of "Blacks Blocs", these ultraviolent groups that had illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw by a paved and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the interrogation of about 20 people, according to the police.
We looked at the extremist groups, warned the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of the order turned to the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came in and out of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky-blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Earth's Friends, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we go down to the streets to claim ecological debt compensation for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: we have time, estimated the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, there are streams where you can walk when you've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992, with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alter-globalist movement approached environmental organizations.
French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, told AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization mobilized several personalities, including Danish mannequin Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, has given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, have exhibited, wearing red robes and bloating bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, gatherings of a few hundred demonstrators have also called for action against climate change.
In France, events organized by the network "350" gathered several hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The history-geo comes out of the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to appear in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "enforced" from the reform of the general school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminals.
Now the first students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of hypocrisy" because he says, "the S line is no longer a scientific line" but "in large, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain S sub-line, he continued, but stressed again: "I have not heard much of historians and intellectuals coming in from the absence of the history-geography in terminal in the technological high schools."
On Saturday, an Ifop survey in L'Humanité revealed that almost seven French out of ten (69%) disagreed with the government's plan to remove the mandatory teaching of the history-geography in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and some right-wing elected.
On the other hand, the minister added that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of the terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their view sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In master 2 (M2), they will undergo an eligibility test at the beginning of the year, which will deal with their discipline, and at the end of the year an admission test that will address their teaching ability, explained the Minister.
They will also follow courses in situation during the year of M2 and then will be a first year in front of students as trainee teachers.
If you add all the courses offered before the competition, you already get more presence before the students, or more than 300 hours, has continued.
Finally, the Minister states that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in National Education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the issues at the Copenhagen Summit: it was the challenge of Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Superior Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, 15 minutes each, filmed and opened to the public, found a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that caught people and gave them the desire to know more, explained on the margins of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day who took his name from the one given by the students to the fish from the school basin.
Twenty participants were selected from among the experts in their discipline and were selected for their charismatic side, he said.
About climate warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but using graphics, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will hold that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
The videos taken from these conferences will be posted online on the school's website from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Delays of payments: anger from prison guards, planned actions
Prison supervisors' unions called on Friday for "general mobility" to demand the payment by the end-of-year holidays of overtime premiums and overtime for which payment was postponed in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd Union of Supervisors) asked staff who will not be in service to manifest Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them", to "denunciate the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "gather in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", judging "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "additional hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first Union of Supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Corrections Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensure that the remainders will be paid in January.
The Chancellery indicated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff in the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I asked the head of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime did not occur in the future, added Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be low, except for management staff receiving the famous functions and objectives, regretted Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints are good".
This is a pure scandal, the interregional FO union of Marseilles has ruled out, announcing its decision to boycott until the new order "all meetings and meetings".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take care of personnel' denies, says the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less crowded than others.
But the account is not there anyway, found Ufap's Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "successier tricks" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, has entrusted the little Oprah Winfrey screen with a simple gift rule: "I give things nicer than those I receive."
As part of a special program that will be broadcast on the ABC channel on Sunday night, the president and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate their new and prestigious birthdays in their new year.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be on the side.
Father Noël also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "certainly" a gift, according to excerpts from the broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama went wrong against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "Of course not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she takin' the president.
Absolutely, has it been required to give up before replying with humor by displaying the First Lady Pearl Necklace: "Who gave you this?".
During this one-hour show, at the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous host who was a fierce support from Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama evoked a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his kenyan father rarely saw offered to him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father came to see us for Christmas and when he gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
It's only much later in my life that I realized that it was him who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to important "harms" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found that the "lesions resulting from the operation" of the discal hernia suffered in Paris on 26 November, told Paris its press service, stating that these injuries had "necessed a repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, sought to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be submitted within 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "paining and complications".
It's only in 48 hours that we'll have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic for this discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This was not available Thursday evening to comment on RTL information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for a follow-up infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself not to become "no concern" for the rocker, who is "a beater".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because it took 12 hours to fly after such an operation, it's not playable, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, was trying to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endigated".
Mr. Camus also said that he had had a conversation with Laetitia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, in general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operating a "small colon cancer", then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been quite a comment. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulty in moving on stage.
By mid-November, his surroundings had even denied a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Bousquet first on its fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalized at the Worlds-2009 in large basins, found on Thursday an international title on a distance that it especially cares about, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro-2009 in small basins in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three records of the beaten world while waiting for a transfer.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, which was oozing on the world record of 50 m free, of which he holds the brand in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the free 50 m, it was the 28-year-old French who imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers started against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet advanced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in the event, I said that if the world record was at my disposal, I would try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from January 1st.
Originally 238 records from the world since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time to German Paul Biedermann, a double champion of the world in large basins this summer in Rome, records from the world to the key.
The young swimmer did not succeed in lowering the mark he holds over 400 m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't take that race to heart.
I knew I couldn't beat a record of the world this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola awarded 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel, which belonged in particular to the French writer Emile Zola, was awarded on Thursday 1.5 million dollars, clearly above his estimate, announced the merchant of art Sotheby's.
This panel before two meters long 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five scenes in the world," he explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
He was sold out of a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have the most expensive up to now, told the AFP a spokesperson of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola goes back a few days.
The panel remained close to 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his particular Parisian hotel, and in Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council prior to the accession to the power of the Maréchal Pétain.
There was a shadow zone of about 50 years.
When searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Maccart".
Attempts of Aborted Departure of Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied an exception from the Putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived Wednesday in El Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya, the Mexican government's aircraft has departed to its place of origin, according to a source of the Migration Branch.
The Putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "get out" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a discharge.
But the President-in-Office refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as an invited Head of State.
The Putschist government "has suffered a new failure in wanting me to give up my charge (...), they wanted me to resign," said Mr. Zelaya on Thursday to Globo radio, on which he has often expressed himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the President dechuted, refugee at the Embassy of Brazil of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's Embassy has submitted us a request except for conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain asylum requests, said Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I do not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to be made as President of the Honduran people, he had emphasized.
The rumors of Mr. Zelaya's departure had mobilized the followers of the dechu president on Wednesday, who had come to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military had strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overturned on June 28, the day when he had organized a popular consultation to prepare his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He was exiled to Costa Rica, returned by surprise on September 21 and took refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out, he will be arrested to respond to the crime of "high treason" whose prosecution of justice, according to the Putschist government.
The Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the U.S.-recognized poll but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street mounts, the US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with US trade balance figures reflecting the resumption of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq , technologically dominant , from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index was 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different sections of the economy, found Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, did it storm, considering that the market was focused on "half full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit declined in October from 7.6% compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected the reverse to cross the deficit.
As well as the imports that the exports have increased.
The great news is the growth in the volumes of trade, in particular for the exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners in the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States rose against all expectations last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the very low of a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday evening and that of the 30-year-old to 4.492% compared to 4.408% on the day before.
Cuba: hundreds of supporters of power consist of the "White Ladies"
A few hundred supporters of Cuba's power have held wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on Thursday for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were interviewed.
Forty "Women in White", married or close to political prisoners, were consummated on the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched towards the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" began to scan, the uplifted poing, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came "to ensure their protection".
The night before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Hawaiian neighbourhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to manifest themselves on Thursday for the international human rights day were, they, asked by civilian police, found a journalist from the AFP.
The police force the dissidents who were convoked by supporters of the government, according to this journalist, in civilian vehicles.
Discontinuations of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Winners of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Women in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to dissent, stated one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain in locks.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" to the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
In a rare case, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of encroaching on rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced to kill an eight-year-old in the knife and injured Clichy-la-Garenne 5
One fortee armed with two knives killed an eight-year-old and injured five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influx, on Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have struck with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, one eight-year-old, in or before a pharmacy of the 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, learned from police sources and from witnesses.
He was severely injured, the old man, born in 1929 by a police union officer Alliance, died in the hospital after his injuries.
In or in front of this same pharmacy, he then took a couple, the woman of whom was pregnant.
The husband, aged 30 years, interfered and was injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogeneary died.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently being affected, depending on police sources.
The pregnant woman then became sick and would have been hospitalized "in shock" according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled to the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passersby, apparently at random: a 30-year-old and a quadrant, the latter grossly.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he was carrying in a cross behind his back, explained in place a head of the Alliance union in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, according to testimony collected by the PSA, tried to control the forced servant.
I saw a guy about thirty years with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept her.
They didn't get there because the guy was tough, called Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Still boulevard Jean-Jaurès, under No.61, two municipal police officers, their leaders, tried to intercept the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the major arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers came to tell me there was someone injured outside.
I came out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a security position, and I saw a very important wound to the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured with a knife wound.
They were the national police officers who arrested the man without identity papers.
Nanterre's Public Prosecutor's Office had before the investigation the Department of Judicial Police of the Upper Seine (SDPJ 92).
The coroner was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not exclude him from being incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all forced into this species whose forces are engaged under the effect of the action."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the cessation of prosecutions
Lawyer Roman Polanski once again claimed Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the prosecution against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, counsel of the director of the "Pianist", denounced three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California with serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I demand the abandonment of the charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has died since -- would have discussed, before rendering his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural fault.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wantedd and wanted" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the prosecutor's own mouth, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "false" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court would refuse to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argumentary.
The prosecution reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski would appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
The Deputy Prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing".
In this case, we want to send the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to flee?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks favor to the court, while disregarding her authority."
One of the three judges -- who now has 90 days to make their decision -- also emphasized "that there were other alternatives to the flight".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The victim's lawyer Samantha Geimer also called once again for the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad chalet, awaiting a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends undirected, frozen by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended up undirected Friday, in a trumped market between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while Nasdaq , with technological dominance , abandoned 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "contributed to improve market opinion on the strength of economic recovery", summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second month of rowing and much more than expected.
In addition, the confidence of American consumers increased significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been hampered by a further increase in the dollar, which has been in the euro for two months, which "pulls down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and that of the 30-year-old to 4.497% on the day before.
Miss Monde's election again in South Africa
After a month's journey through South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss Monde are preparing to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already booked their ticket for the half-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta du Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma du Canada were elected Sports Miss or Miss top model during their African stay.
This was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and experienced so much!, Miss Sierra Leone exclaimed.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17h00 (15h00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to restore my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova points out in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian girl, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "the landscapes to cut the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the Priyanka Chopra steps, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood stars.
It is the dream of every woman being crowned the most beautiful in the world but it is nothing but appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, Miss Inde launches with a big smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will show up in traditional costume and of course in swimwear.
The show will be animated by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss Monde Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it knew how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates made a safari last year, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time on the bike, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
They also met with the South African President, Jacob Zuma, who held their hands.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone notes.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the fate draw in Cape (southwest) for the June 2010 World Football Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been dating people I never thought I could approach.
I'm definitely coming back for the 2010 World Cup, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he had to go to his father's hair hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's happening very well, told the press David Hallyday at his departure from the plane that drove him from Paris shortly after 1300 locals (21H00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured him that he was going to go "very fast" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a consequent infection to the operation of a discile hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for a subsequent infection to the operation of hernia discala on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reopened on Wednesday night to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laetitia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade was educated to attend a school show, a photographer from the AFP was observed.
The head of orthopedic and traumatic surgery at the Hospital de la Pitié-Salpêtriere, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go to Los Angeles on Monday to the singer.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the Monceau International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were fired, said Mr. Camus.
I've heard about a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday was "part too fast for Los Angeles, with permission from the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip, and this surprised me, since I had two discal hernies myself, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "left without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before his death in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsburg to resorb a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a sulphide-reputy doctor, convicted on several occasions by justice, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scrupulously" pursued "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well conducted" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any event, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a tour resumed on 8 January (at Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and sum the New Centre no longer using its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, while holding him back from using him on no support, in the event of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF century, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy before the NC National Council on Saturday.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for having been the first to file it to the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF Association's office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to let go, came out of his silence in order to set up the Minister and the Member of Parliament, insisting that he no longer use the seal and transmit the property of the trade mark to them, subject to judicial prosecutions.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement of +recover+ the UDF acronym, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it would be good to track on your militant material and on your site's custody page, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, the slogan +the UDF of today+, also found the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to the use of this acronym, explains the UDF office that enforces the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as (on) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (la) mark to his legitimate rights".
If you failed to do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, preventing the signatories.
In their mail, they state that the UDF "is a fully-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP".
In their view, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recalled that the last UDF congress in 2007 voted on its three-year membership of MoDem and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continued, "when he filed the trade mark", he was not "more adherent to the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
He was scandalously and fraudulently taking advantage of the abscess of deposit of the UDF acronym to do so on his behalf.
This indelicacy is becoming a crime, they denounce, before ironing on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than trying to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case : François-Marie Banier will be tried for weakness abuse
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as accused by the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian for the spoil of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his pictures of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and 375,000 euros of fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter broke up while holding the queens of the empire of the Cosmetics L'Oréals.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be carried out collegially by three doctors.
L'Oréal's principal heir and shareholder has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any event not under the conditions proposed by Nanterre's Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The designated doctors will have to report by 10 March 2010 in particular if Liliane Bettencourt has been in a state of weakness and at what time.
I think she's going to submit.
I'm going to talk to him about it, he said at the end of the hearing Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For his part, lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been prosecuting the criminal charge against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-inclusive artist, who accuses her of profiting during years of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court was required to examine the admissibility of the action initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' arguments were sometimes directed at the large family breakdown on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters from her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to lawyer: "can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since she got married."
For his part, Nanterre's prosecutor again felt that the complainant was not entitled to act, especially since a guardian judge had refused to grant her application for judicial protection for her mother in recent days.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in its place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial was held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management Revolution or End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than ten years, the attitude of managing large-scale companies towards their employees has been a reminder of the position of companies facing consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of getting employees to "values" determined as it once was, of imposing on consumers the products thought by the factory technicians.
By putting the client at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has handed over the procurement strategies to the site... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products of customer preference factors comes back on a regular basis!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilisation seriously undermines the development of all the company's intellectual functions, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a prospective vision"; it requires employees to commit themselves to the full infringement of the authoritarian management revenue.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to put the employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as Orange's questionnaire to its employees – encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I could see that, in the face of a new situation, all structures finally arrive, after many detours, to do priority... what she has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the diseases of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old life-threatening theory, recently reactivated by the "neurossciences" of the United States and widely disseminated, on their own, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent survey of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr is strengthening leaders in a mechanistic governance position, inadequate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, implies adopting a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists of incorporating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of achieving some of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
Currently, only the studies from the Reasoning Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life plans.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and deliver their management of human resources "to the place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo's Speech: The "Just War" is worth praise right to Obama
The U.S. right greeted the speech given last night in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "Just War" against the US enemies.
The Conservatives, who had cut off the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for Vice-Presidentship in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the right wing of the Republican Party, in the USA Today daily, adding that she herself has addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that have just been published.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over there, she thought.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done very good work in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this whole-of-historical speech, said Mr.Gingrich, interviewed during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elect, considered by some as a potential candidate for Republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, said pleased to have seen "a president on the left" remind members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free and could not give a peace price if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former lead became a chronicle in Washington Post, Obama said "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as "a citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Mr.Gerson.
Among the rare to the right not to be convinced, a Bush faucon, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "tern, ampoule and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the President, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When war is involved in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained commendable at the President's seat.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was previously awarded to Mr. Obama, qualified his address as "superproduction" even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the daily Californian fires.
Obama "spoke the speech he needed," said the New York Times, judging him as "both dark and uplifting."
Routes: Three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon-negotiating sessions, the road trade unions and TLF, the sole employer organization to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening to end the strike order and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "joined" of this agreement, after several negotiations, started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators left in the morning of Friday, hoping to sign the text of agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And the same thing as three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had shut the door.
But it took more than six hours from a meeting started at 11 a.m. to make everyone agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very harmful to businesses" and "it was to fear that it would disrupt the holidays of the end of years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international transport).
At the hourly rate, for low wages, "we turn from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're leaving very far, said Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we're going to give orders to our militants that there are no blockades, no blockades from the refuelling centres.
But we can still have a few recalcitrators who aren't happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, praised "a good deal", even though it was "difficult to grant increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be around 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the re-evaluation of travel costs of 3%, and the general holding of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will include addressing the question of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of €100 million in the employer's expenses" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending financial law for 2009, voted on Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same way".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply in the first instance to undertakings that are members of that organization, and in the second place to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will take place "in the shortest possible time", assured Mr. Bussereau.
Opposition from employers can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupe market", as the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the next alarming dynda eaters, Unostra deplored.
For the Other, the agreement is likely to "brought the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector within the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, disgruntled trade unions of RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A, France's largest urban transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday to the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management left them on their hunger as to their demand for premiums.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important pre-Christmas shopping weekend, there will be trains only between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to a two-on-one train on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a four-on-four train outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change train.
Lafayette Galleries, which await 200,000 customers every day, were delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve large stores."
The A RER through the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The short RATP section of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train out of two circled at peak hours, and almost no copper in dark hours, as expected.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Francilians were organized.
In the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially due to the absence of colleges and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not know about saturation, said SNCF, which had provided a management of law enforcement officers and forces.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare station to reach the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "magres" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, which claim a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its parentheses premium proposals, pointed out the CGT, stressing that management "was not careful to solve a problem when road and SNCF were done".
A new meeting is planned on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," said RATP.
This also made the trade unions say that the company "was mocking the users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a headquarters establishment committee in Paris.
It was then that the management, who refused to discuss during the strike until then, had suggested "in the interest of calming down" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to extend to RER B Tuesday, after the deposit of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions request a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros vary (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to millions daily of travellers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of the career, fall from 2,200 to 2.700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros of premiums for offset hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurde party, a heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court declared on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurde party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the government's task, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "framework of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the President of the Court Hasim Kiliz told the press, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified seven-voting majority was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr. Kilicç, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Number of observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it has no "organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to cut Kurds' support for the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had claimed that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the south-eastern Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great town of the southeast populated by Kurds.
The forces of the order fired from tearymogenic grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with leaves.
A hundred people have also shown in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the Justice decision was going to "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this question (kurde, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed by principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpell of the government's democratic openness, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
One can of course expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a tough winter.
But the Head of the Road Deployment and Sanding Service (FES) makes it clear that it is not to humiliate citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn how to master them.
And according to meteorologists, this could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and ice.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as he went to snow on the city of Frankfurt and that the temperatures below zero, large sablading vehicles traveled 20 main routes (called itineraries A) .
This includes the streets at large, the main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Fire-fired access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and roads are also included, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers start their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road shall be salted with a road fondant that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the EDF service starts at 3 am in the morning "so that roads are cleared when daily migration begins."
That's where it gets harder, it's when the snow falls at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, we are told by the manager of the clearing and sanding service of the roads "because no motorist is willing to let the salt vehicles pass."
Then, if it no longer snows, we deal with access roads and dessert roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Sideways and lateral streets come last.
Mr Braenburger is well aware that this still causes a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot team sets out to prioritize the areas deemed dangerous and crossings.
For cyclable tracks, the EDF services generally cannot take care of this.
Mr. Brauburger said there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the status of bridges between 22 and 4h30.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also make use of this special service in cases of need.
Dinosaurs were bluffing them.
The Tawa foundae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipede was about 2 meters long for 1,50m tall, its posterior limbs were powerful, its long skull was filled with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms were finished with scarves and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt report from Texas University in Austin and his colleagues in the Science magazine of Thursday, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the emerging land of the supercontinent, the Pangee and was located toward the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa illuminates the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us of their relationship, distribution and characteristics.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt began searches with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch website north of New Mexico
Randall Irmis from Utah's Natural History Museum and member of the search team relates that sometimes they were able to find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers baptized her by the name of Tawa according to the word of the Indians Hopi for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a completely exceptional discovery: the dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bone.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, however, he says that it allows to confirm certain theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth approximately 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making the classification of the first dinosaurs very difficult.
The experts ask about, among other things, the time when the Saurians divided into three major evolution groups: theopods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaur and the velociraptor that appeared later and of which the birds, the sauropods, quadruped on the neck, and those that are related to them and the ornithischi herbivores that include species such as triceratops and stegosaure.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropods .
This species has an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, S. Nesbitt said.
Researchers found clues that the Tawa found small airbags in its skull-level bones, as well as birds that are the descendants of the thyroids.
These small air pockets facilitate bird breathing compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa findae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest airbags in its bones.
As the related line of immense sauropods also had airbags and a light bone, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the sauriens had appeared there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all of the emerging lands that formed the Pangee supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists has also discovered the remains of two other therapies that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advancing researchers.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn says that there is an even older species, the silesaure, who lived in current Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong vision because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while there are practically none on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary age while they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the present crocodiles and with many other sauriens.
Toward the end of the Trias the dinosaurs were spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not everlasting.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There could be a massive extinction at which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or, then, dinosaurs were better suited and could have eliminated competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favouring the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which had been living in the shadow since that time: they were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Vienna University or Berkeley California.
There are those of course officers at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
Evacuation by the casino police at J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with protest students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, the police intervention requested by the university's steering committee is ignored.
Last week, the President of the Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in strike after walls and works of art were barbed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during evacuation.
The signatories felt that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commander against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention solely on acts of vandalism serves only to "legitimize and criminalize the protest" and tries to make the reasons for the mobilization forgotten.
The University's Steering Committee was thus excluded from the discussions that would be essential.
Course officers require immediate suspension of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
Young people from the Verdi Service Sector Union and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) are supportive of students.
Protests are merely the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, the regional secretary of the youth of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) , she took action by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the sites is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the Aksuelle Stunde television show.
We understand the meaning of protests but do not accept vandalism, expressed the DSU MP of the Peter Beuth Regional Parliament.
Parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (Die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the party La Gauche (Linke)
Instead of reflecting on the students' arguments and demands, they are evacuated.
The Party La Gauche tabled a motion which encloses the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
For a long time it was the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place for searching for secret arms, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
There are important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics.
As of September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, a place of French science – with academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday, representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Strategic Cooperation Protocol".
The signatories were Moscow's deputy mayor Juri Rosljak and Zelenograd's Anatoly Smimov prefect for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will start in Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
It is located at the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnique, the big companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centres are implanted.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The size of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If you want to. S21, it is much more than the sinking of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Bade-Württemberg, into a hopeless chaos of constructions for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The line-head stations, with tracks ending in the middle of the city, were renowned at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that made effect of the brake shoe of the modern rail traffic because it took a lot of time to move the locomotives from the back forward.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what we need to do.
That's why the line-head stations must disappear: Frankfurt and Munich.
Also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is located about halfway to the Trans-European Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from which the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the line-head stations no longer really pose problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with highways and pilot car at both ends.
However, we are now launching Stuttgart 21 next to the new intercity line to Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have taken it away.
The railway company is on the side, because it is the taxpayer who carries the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban perspective, this project is relatively justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe in the graphics of the planners generated by computer – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people to whom it was attributed - and it is typical of the 80s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening the traffic of goods because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other rail projects.
For example, €6 billion will be included in the Souabe project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade, this money will be missing for other points of joining and bulking in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the 180-kilometre Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be very urgent to put a full foothold on the fungus here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international goods traffic, which is in the heart of Europe.
Government examines the judgment on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of appealing to the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Tribunal concerning the ban on air flights at night.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had instructed experts to review from a legal point of view the judgment rendered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the ban on night flights in the case or the construction project of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
The authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 23 and 5 hours in the morning, as envisaged by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air damage.
The coalition must have decided for 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this time frame and attempts to pressure the representative of the Government to appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel parliamentary group invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be conditioned as a total failure to a given word.
It is extremely difficult to be allowed to keep his word," said Green Leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the Electoral slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's complaints that the Government of the Land is still trying to authorize night flights by using "advocacy and rollover".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of its fraction on the ban on night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. banks reimburse the aid allocated
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, derive from their ties towards the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it fully reimbursed $45 billion (more than €30 billion) in the Treasury, corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp life plan.
CNBC's television channel revealed in a report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to rid themselves of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of bonuses allocated to the managers and the regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors who had paid it $19 billion in fresh money.
The remainder of the sum comes from the bank's funds that are well filled through the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America specifically thanked the U.S. taxpayers: the capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying the Merrill Lynch investment bank at the highest rate of financial torment.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money on financial markets in order to free itself from the government's guardianship.
The U.S. bank could thus launch a 20 billion dollar capital increase on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain citing the banking community.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley paid back the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Eventually everything happened faster than planned.
Only two weeks after the limoage of the current post of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German chain ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs ZDF's Berlin edition, was the great favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also the intention not to further harm the SDF Schachter SDF Schachter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 Commission members on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council supported Brender's reconstitution and 7 others voted against. Brender's vote was a well-predicted failure for Schächter.
In fact, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already heard several weeks before the vote, did not want to re-enter Brender's position.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief by referring to the fact that the rate of listening to the information broadcasts of the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests still took place, almost until the vote, flogging the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had joined the debate and who considered Koch's way of doing so to be anti-constitutional.
But that would have done nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied the sciences-politics, the pedagogy and the Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked in the Südwestfunk (Rhenania-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German newspaper of national significance).
In 1983 he became a editor in the ZDF, first of all in the news magazine "heute-journal" (present-day newspaper).
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the associate of the editor-in-chief of the time; then he corresponded to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was chief and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (a bimonthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin edition.
After Brender's misdemeanor, while he had just been elected a journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent to the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, stated last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the employer's proposals could not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political figures from the supervisory commissions of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor had skillfully acted with the Board of Directors by criticising the commission with vehemently in his decision to limoger Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as could the Board of Directors elect it without being suspected of placing a political partisan in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classed liberal of the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Part success for students: After a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliative: during a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the rectors conference, an agreement was developed that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination should allow the study module to be completed.
In addition, the workload will need to be recognised to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also undertook to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master branches.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have repeatedly spoken the phrase in fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be completed by a single examination", one can read in a document of about 30 pages on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, states that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, we should be able to stop the deraping, which had a significant impact on studyability.
In the future, the "studyability" should be the crucial criterion for the organization of studies.
Modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if you can't avoid this feeling of suffocation that you sometimes feel in the course selection.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the possibility and scope to enable and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that in 2015 only all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programs were not too busy and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already heard with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
To date, Rhineland-Palatinate is the only country to have agreed to provide more means for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs to strengthen educational guidance offices as well as review offices and international relations service
The Länder and universities are planning a budget of EUR 10 million for this purpose.
In early 2010, the Government wishes to table an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
As a result, only one exam will be required to complete his studies.
The organization of studies should be more flexible, the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions must be ensured and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the question of conditions for study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated but criticisms were heard.
The federal president of the union of socialist students said he would like to see the organization of education policy no longer going on in the future "last closed doors" of Ministers and rectors of universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as individuals should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education were supported by the Chair of Delegates of the Rector Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us" said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. He demands the right and the possibility for each Bachelor to register for a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also requests that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students, there will be sufficient places tomorrow for Master studies and study conditions as good as possible.
The Länders must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education have not referred to the possibility of lightening access to the Master.
More than one footnote on Herta Müller
It is through these words "Arrived to Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by poet Werner Söllner, in which he theatizes in bribs of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who has gained freedom but has at the same time lost his language territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a German and English teacher in Bucharest and subsequently a collection manager in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he held the chair of highly coveted poetry from Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum of Hesse at the artist's house of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He talked a lot about it in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a convention in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your safety records".
Remarkably destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer who had collaborated as an informant for the security policy police.
Söllner received the German language prize in 1989 together with some of the participants.
Enrollment tests began insidiously in 1971.
I am, therefore, concluded by Söllner, "someone who has not been able to resist security intimidation tests."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honour of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary emigrants with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the bass of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own security file, IM Walter played a role, assured the specialist of the Michael Markel literature after Söllner's confession and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He was able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The way in which Söllner made his statement and before this public was unexpected, however, the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services is not in fact so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had previously written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have speculated and sometimes guessed what real names were last hiding the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter borrowings.
On the contrary, Germany where in the meantime consulting the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the security files is still very confusing.
A systematic clarification has been constantly counter-branched and braking in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was established to work on the assimilation of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the return of the files has rather delayed since.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania be still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former Head of the Temesvar Security who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, expresses itself in three ways in detail with respect to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power was thought to be able to express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many questions are bound up with the Söllner case as they occur so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been spoliated? The heavy reaction of the listeners, with Söllner's consent, lets hope that the continuation of this chapter will be more defined by a thirst to know that only by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Tumultes at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived there, shot at four pins coming right from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had scaled his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross mounted at midnight less a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose bald skull drew attention, let himself be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our fiftieths could have taken the wheel himself – he did not drink alcohol, nor was he drunk of happiness.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because now it's gonna start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just begun three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth of the finals," that is to say in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to return.
The "big job" awaits us on Sunday.
Here, it is about repeating in Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have re-made surface after the three shipping goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots of draw
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ match return 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be fired in the lottery on December 18th in Nyon.
Therefore, the joy of the entry into the fulminant function of the successor of Babbel was moderate.
And joy was not moderate only in those who had been lucky, who had passed on to the professionals of Stuttgart destabilized, a perfect motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I was to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "smoothing of souls" – Gross - the recipe for the success that sounded so, although it did no more effect with the Babbel healer.
He triggered a certain magic, conna Jens Lehmann - partisan of Babbel -, "in the football when there is a new impulse there is sometimes things that we would never have believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the " phenomena" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It's someone who moves to action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the lead yet, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated defence and weakens Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before having had a bad wake four days later at Leverkusen with 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't had a hard time yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th birthday had no heart to celebrate, even after the first home win in three months, it was from the events of the weekend that a television interview by the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann rebounded just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, would counter Heldt, in response to the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the management of style weakness and said that she had decided to change her coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann also saw as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the games was abolished.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure egoism" behind Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two quadrogens.
In any case, they agreed to everything else, that without the group's prior work by the replaced coach, the strong sport and combat performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in the success" retorting Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man in the plastic bag aquiesça.
World heavyweight championship
Warm fighting in Berne: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, the Ukrainian defended its world championship title of heavy weights according to the WBC federation version.
At the unanimity of the judges he imposes himself on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains its title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night, the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at points unanimously by the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defended his title with honour since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had twice won the World Champion title of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, out 39 times winning in 41 professional fights, confessed twice his defeat because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko sought to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, on its left side.
Johnson, 11 centimeters smaller who, prior to the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, succeeded in avoiding the blows of the champion, thus forcing Klitschko to play his right dangeure.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried mostly to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and in gestures his shots only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, he has exceeded the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital of Switzerland before the fight.
He insults Klitschko the traitor of "smocking zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the harvest Friday, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by dropping his nose-lit sunglasses "in order to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko once again imposed in his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a nearly four-year break, he had beaten at the time Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without combat.
This year, defending his title as a champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return on the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was scheduled to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotional company is now planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Gutenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (Die Linke) ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following consideration of the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formed a contravestment" on the killing of two tank trucks last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD Chain "Tagesschau" (the 8:00 a.m. newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to the full disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in substance, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Gutenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the fragpe was actually, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the US air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday, to make a brief statement to the federal Parliament and to reveal what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the view that Ms. Angela Merkel must clearly state whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan federal government's policy if the chancellery, the army and intelligence have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery did not in any way influence the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, more and more voices were being made to express doubts about the real reasons why Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert had been sent back to the ministry.
According to the information in the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Gutenberg about the attack of tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden certain embarrassing details to the Minister.
However, in the presence of the two senior officials, they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a military police report.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reported that Wichert had in the meantime requested clarification of the facts in a mail.
Up to now, it has not received a response
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred to the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, which was to become the following Wednesday in order to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dream
Some see, wake up, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is nothing but the boundaries between imagination and reality in the case of mental patients, or under the effect of drugs.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything goes very well.
When we lie in our dark rooms, we can easily indulge in the darkest dreams and ghosts.
However, the one who, awake, makes the experience of a state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices only appear in mental or drug-related patients.
It's our imagination that's at stake: it's the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes encourages the limits between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect are distinguished, the visions of Hildegard von Bingen's mystics, the drug experiments of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, the psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or deliriums when balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - in the first place dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achethylcholine - breaks down and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earthly Attraction Force no longer has power over the person.
From antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always pondered the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, the hallucinations were a form of dream-awakened; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, saw in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T becomes a character of a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions with the colors created.
Earth attraction no longer has power over it, it plans to reach the ceiling.
He's feeling a bit.
Behind him creatures of devil fins, grinning, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They pursue him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, feel pain throughout the body.
Toning voices, foul, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo chain, in fact a loop and the hook attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a buffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop goes away.
That this serves as a lesson for you, shout the voices in a choir to pull out the tympan. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years, the first 20 years soon.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, it is also maniac-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned how to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
During psychosis, I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics, this is the most frequent disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which makes them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, sexual madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the consciousness is drowned under the sensations.
Just like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and ghosts from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatric department of the Heidelberg CHU (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrene is at the heart of the situation, with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act actively on them.
That is why schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Do experience once in his life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved."
The delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place within a real framework.
Why does our brain make this kind of cabrioles, it's always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to momentarily losing the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have severe brain damage.
Neuron maturation of the brain is assumed to be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way the neural system anomaly occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience may be a psychotic trigger, if there is, however, a predisposition.
Likewise, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms up.
What's crazy, we're told by Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of viewpoint.
Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Mind".
The hallucinations are part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychosis but also of an impressive number of other diseases.
They include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Halucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently cooled; when our brain heats but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as a brain injury or a psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledge that they have experienced hallucination at least once in their lifetime.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. was 16, living in a small town in Mecklembourg-Pomerania before and going to high school.
A girl who's doing normal things for real.
If there were no images and voices.
During recreation, a young, thin, long-haired boy comes to him with the word.
When she answers her friends, they look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this nice young lady.
I'm crazy, she asks sometimes.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally scary.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and that the teacher is clearly explaining equations in the table.
At night the apparitions are generally scary.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and well too late, she cannot often make the distinction if she is awake or already dreams, if the images she sees, the smiling faces or the young girl with bloody steps on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd take it for a fool.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her berry last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is that he has hallucinations after a certain time.
I assume that the brain is not quite busy, making sure there is animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned when she was 13 years old that the man she called Dad, since she was of thought age, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Each experience", according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form into the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, unfortunately, there is a quick tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic of Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease that also contains something positive, a creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called honorioid, a particular form of changing consciousness awakened by dream.
Oniroid vecus are very complex semi-resurrections that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that it cannot differentiate from the dream even when it is awake.
Oniroid consciousness occurs during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy, they experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of himself and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a state of mind-limit between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
In fact, this is an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an organizational capacity that is given to us men, not to overwhelm in the absence of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich Peter Cornelius Classen, a historian of art also describes his honourable experiences in his book "Changment of Heart" as a saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscious part of a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during that time, his body was condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world that he has created of all rooms, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man allied in a railway sanatorium, a robot to his watch over his health.
He lives in mid-age among nobles who manufacture blood-based narcotics.
He is removed by a Greek motorcycle that takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It completely absorbs in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these inland trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, writing in describing what he has lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are of extreme clarity and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than real life.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the honoroid deliries, psychosis, hallucinations and psychiatric experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, concluded psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years of age, the children will be followed up by the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to re-open the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, the editor Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly determined to integrate society, Hubert Burda said, 69, in Spiegel.
All details have been fixed in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
They will also need to see if they are capable of this.
It is not possible to impose its children on 7500 employees without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with them.
This would demolition children as well as the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first and foremost responsible for the technology sector.
He then deals with the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time this is not a family member who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children were 19 and 17 respectively, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment is also used to link up the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have been driven by a bulimia of capital, which have made enormous unfortunate speculations by thinking that they could climb even higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I don't see myself in the country's role as a preceptor as it could be Springer and I don't intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is the objective that has been set by El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious teachers like Hedonai, laser hair specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatments rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a diet ray, with in particular a tea salon, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a champagne cup.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of customers, offering them fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly carry out our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after having made our body work, we want to go through the hairdressing salon, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the key words of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10h to 22h.
Miscellaneous take-offs
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The form of decolletion, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to consider.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated take-off. This is not highly recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with the electric car
The Endesa electric company, in collaboration with the City Council of Barcelona, created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Bureau" will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will establish mobility agreements, taking steps, coordinating, providing grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, collect the views and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city involved in the construction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the deployment of the electric car.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It aims to promote research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative for Endesa to participate in the promotion of the electric car.
The company takes part in European standardisation groups and a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE are under way.
Zapatero encounters "a future of tranquility" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, has "a future of peace" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the Government President's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the Executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the automotive competitiveness plan, today we would have a abandonment landscape, closing some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Through this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Plan for the Automobile Sector (IPA), devoted EUR 800 million to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than €3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the Chairman, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "strong increase" of registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Exhibition of collection cars, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pavilón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can motorcycles and collection cars be found there, but you will also find items in ClassicAuto Madrid of all kinds related to the engine world.
For example, at the flag exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, complements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will bring happiness to collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Santas de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Classicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Exterior fitness test
But the commercial activity of this show will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with cars and collection motorcycles will also take place on a circuit arranged outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sport spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated the engine stopping and start system, called i-Stop, which, at least for the time being, is only available on the 150-horse engine 2.0.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheel is also particularly pleasant.
By continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that as well as Mazda3 that Civic, both Japanese, contrasts with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Gulf of Volkswagen, that they all want to overcome.
By continuing with the habitat, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, a large box of regular shapes.
The engine's automatic shut-off and start-up system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre petrol engine and 150 horses and with manual change of the six-speed.
This engine is truly happy. It is illustrated by its finesse, its low noise, its benefits and the control of its consumption.
Although the most sought-after Mazda3 models are diesel models, those that do not make a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is Sport, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the track change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive interior mirror, the edge computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, the independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the audio bluetooth, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment was not sufficient, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional EUR 1,500, includes, among other elements, two-way adaptable lights and a BOSE audio system with disc loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
In particular, it illustrates the quality of materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make a lot of kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version only associated with the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, Sportive.
In return for this important amount, Mazda3 will give us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "first"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality incarnate by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have us more than ever glamorous, dressed in such elegant and sexy models for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a "lady" dark.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at his e-mail, without offering the possibility of seeing some type of attachments or browsing on the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
Actually, it's more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, or less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone's date subscription.
In view of its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free live data service, for six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American great-brother, but he has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those travelling with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to check out their mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it's been a long time since it should work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the little characters.
Recalls to the European Commission's repeated order to offer affordable roaming rates throughout Europe have had an almost perceptible effect.
Outside its home country, we hesitate to use the data, and we're not wrong.
That a small device like FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators start thinking differently and study various proposals that allow them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, including the download of books and other Internet searches.
No subscription and no gallery.
This is a connected device and is paid when you purchase it and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: an option to purchase with access to life as Peek already proposes it in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the preferred color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's position in the U.S. presidency with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose the same in fact to accompany her in the second, no doubt the most important moment of her life: the surrender to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow drawing towards the green with bright reflections, twice, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So at first glance, it would seem that the first lady in the United States follows the path of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to restore the same outfits.
But the fabric in which both sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick tooth for the take of the function, it would, on the other hand, carry a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium heel green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden model, this time.
The hair also changed: the hair is now raised as it was carried off the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Feverhood and career of women in Spain" carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer (Instituto de la Mujer) shows.
The survey, conducted out of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have had their career limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences between the start of life in couples and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of employment.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have a unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, resist entry into married life and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of fixed employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in a couple. This figure is 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "This data shows that women with stable employment have needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exerted has a strong influence on maternity, but less on the date of common start of life," says CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who did elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and at an average of 32.1 years.
"Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education get married and have their first child before finding stable employment, those who have done middle-level or higher-level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several brand products, waving the universal motto "Because I value it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, comes to join other celebrations inscribed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Prior to her, the last to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British Fashion Prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, of yesterday and today, met for their annual award, which was held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed your appointment.
Former mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best mannequin of the year.
The Ace Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographs" by writers who have lived through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does so not according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical sum, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the core of the ignition of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither the friars nor the lighting.
Delightful, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you a few instants here.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, that which I felt without naming it: pleasure against the mortal destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in blood, not in the head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, devoid of sense, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of the universal literature, which must be scaled up by the north side, on which the best mountaineers are still and always taken."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the cry of dement pushed from a bridge by this character from Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and did it in the flight of himself and invoking the post-territory with a violent speech to the asticites."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneels down and prays: "Godly beloved, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave the verses of Spenser were engraved: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the life, tired the death ransomed."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband normally agreed that Edouard VII was standing between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man as patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent exceeded madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it was not to try to conceal Joyce from Baroja?
What's Benet trying to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did this do if it was not to aspire to the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?"
A lethargy attack
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 went by her and our dog, a blood-mele, saved from the SPA and weighed no more than six pounds, and without a word, they took him two shots of feet that left the dog badly injured.
Our anger is immense because we do not see what there is to amuse to assault for free a small defenceless animal who, moreover, was left behind.
In addition, it is necessary to add to this the indignation of a lady who walks quietly and who, when she insults these individuals, fears them for her physical integrity, since an energy which attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone who is weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., one Tuesday as another, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint at the headquarters of the neighbourhood even if we doubt that this is good for us and not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Indignity has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what happens to young people so that they find fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, together for the port of helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the helmet port, mainly among the younger motorcycle riders, as both structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet port, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in case of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributed to this objective through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new two-wheel helmet-port incentive campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the widest circulation.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the light market for light commercial vehicles begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be clouded, since the reference to the comparison was particularly bad in November 2008, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous fiscal year.
Since January, all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (varied by passenger cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
Although the large clouds most affected by their demand have not been cleared, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases thanks to external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of banking appropriations, other factors such as increased unemployment or the persistence of poor economic circumstances should be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a Co2 emission level that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, they may also benefit, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we again recalled the need for administration to attach particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The concessionaires' association provides for a year similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As has been done with the ABS braking system and as will be done with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory component on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of vehicles a period of shortage has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen pedestrian protection, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many back crashes.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car manufacturer, one third of drivers involved in an accident could not rely on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The aid intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the so-called emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four disasters with wounded would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to radar or camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors postponed until January the plan for Opel
While workers at the Figueruelas factory (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would need more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, understands that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the application of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, is of importance.
In case there would not agree with any of them, GM could sell a portion of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Flying by the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious gem, Porsche engineers left Boxster S and managed to cut it apart from less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to move, first of all, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual roof, allowing them to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winnings, to mount sports basketballs, 12 kilos, and with lightweight tyres of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, winning six more kilograms and replacing the door handles with cloth handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK box, the test was performed on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads of the secondary network of California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
Their behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with lead.
On the contrary: it was a long time since we had not tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees so much security in the turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles small speed during the necessary time, until we ask him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Flight motor sound
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option or by means of a system that modifies the engine roar, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether stopped or at recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The road coating we walked with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed well the chicken nests.
The electronic assistants barely acted on the whole trip, while on some turns we found glazing in the morning and gravel later in the morning.
Finally, an ultralight car, the most entertaining to drive and that is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
“ Bag Girl ”
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her face as a bad girl with as much containment as her Chanel bags.
More than a Bad Girl or an It Girl is a Bag Girl.
Baskonia offers itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral obtained a triumph at 91-82 during his visit on the hard terrain of Maccabi Electro, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. He thus stands in the lead of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show which, with eight carts at three points, was the best of his team (29 of evaluation).
Vitoria's team has been able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large amount of commitment and collective work, even though it has to wait until the end to win the victory.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets at three points marked, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blue and red, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team had been marked from the perimeter, it was suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with their hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter-time.
The second quarter-time was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's interior game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by applause and applause back to his former house, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be noted as his team's best player, with 13 points marked, although the "less six" of Splitter's evaluation already made it clear that this night was not going to be the best of Brazilians.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at pause, nothing was played, far from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's that we don't win so easily on their ground, and thanks to "Elias' hand," they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the benefit of the yellows on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, injured but far from being dead, needed to chain a few skilled actions to take the air, and it was at this time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared that, with three consecutive-point carts and the help of English and Ribas, returned the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises succeeded in increasing at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play everything for the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they were not going to let anyone take what they deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis drew close in the last minute (80-85), the part was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Wounds prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece in the face of Olympiacos and gave him the head of Euroliga Group B in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion, nor by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and having a large budget.
The game of the first quarter-time, allowed the Andalusian to dream. An aggressive defense and three carts at three consecutive points, two of Omar Cook's driver and one of Guillem Rubio's who set up the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the interior game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American drivers Beverley and Williams led the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team started working by showing its superiority in both camps, while the outing for injury from the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal mistakes weighed on the Unicaja.
The interior players and the Lithuanian wingmen Linas Kleizas, with their three-point carts, grew the 44-32 advantage in the nineteenth minute.
Impossible uphill
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, grew superior and even equalled the difference in the fight in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, giving chance to the group's head.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, to Cook's three-point baskets, and to Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos was implacable when the players were pushing and showing their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to remount the score at 81-62, at thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How many should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would earn based on their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How much should you pay?" calculates the wages of users from more than 140,000 job offers available in Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since one week the application has worked, the search engine has detected that in general, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a communiqué Trovit product manager, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available To find out from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives EUR 34,247 gross per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well paid job in Spain is that of a server, with 11 592 euros net annually, followed by a seller, with 14 725 euros, and a worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most sought jobs on the Internet over the last three months are drivers, middle-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The returned President will have to leave the diplomatic legion no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, following his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline set: "My position is to leave as quickly as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in Brazil's embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the political exile that he intended to impose the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which inflation of assets constituted the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty arose again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions on an uncertain future.
The solution used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetaryize debt through direct acquisition of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at near zero rates, in order for financial institutions to purchase assets to be mobilised.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically finalised and, without challenging their non-conformist liquidity policy, begin to put a little sand on the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their award to one year of next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing an inverse reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of stock exchanges and the deviations from business obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Once again, there is a shift towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in the differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this instability episode, but then Standard & Poor's threat of a new revision to the lower qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk defenders, who were again trying to raise a case of conscience for those responsible for global economic policy that had curbed the destructive effects of the limitation of credit on job destruction, while what should be done is a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is like a tribal struggle between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot to roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country in the euro area to fail to meet its commitments.
On the other hand, it makes sense that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek Government to be transparent and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gap increases to the extent of European business obligations, we do not have to worry.
If the European gap was decreasing and ours continued to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiographic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdotal. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise their forecasts upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who come back to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it doesn't give much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the time being "safety is mother of certainty".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the Subcommission of the Congress of Members, where the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his intervention, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the Sub-Commission, at eight o'clock.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million up to 2020 and EUR 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 on, the question changes, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses both on gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, he considers that 18 000 MW are needed more, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the Government's draft Sustainable Economy Act is in line with what his company claims, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate warming policies.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "time" measures, as the President of Iberdrola has described them.
In any case, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, should begin to be taken, because they take some time before they reach maturity and a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus maintenance market in ten airports
Swiss company Swissport, subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of a leading partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaborative protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on highways and airports.
Sharea disputes its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for its first concession highway in Australia, on which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site at stake is an estimated tunnel of $1,700 million (about €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a public works firm and concessionaire of highways.
The city mayor wishes to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to $1,700 million (about €1,047 million) and in the last phase, three consortia are faced with a remarkable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish smooth company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground workers.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French manufacturer Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, the capital of which is shared between the Austrian Leighton (filial of the German builder Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of CSA), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Galician company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major jobs and privatisations, but entering it is a major challenge, if not by the way of acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, mentioned above, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an invalid step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has barely won a seat on this market because of its 30% stake in Hochtief, Leighton's owner.
Millionary assets
Action has focused on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the area of desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind turbine park, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and directs the pooling of companies to erect and manage the Adelaide desalinizer, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the markets for construction and infrastructure management.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Infrastructure Bureau of the city of Brisbane and Northern Link (northern shore), is called to link the western highway of Toowong to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule established by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this road toll will be open at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will bring 500 million Australian dollars ($308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to have much fruity Hochtief, which mentioned yesterday the obtaining of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fibre-optic broadband network.
This intervention will enable 400 000 people to have rapid Internet access and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company sold the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been entrusted with the work of expanding the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the construction site is scheduled for early 2010 and will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is being awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to Mrs Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator has indicated.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented themselves to the call for tender organized by Renfe, including four finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million in France Télécom to slow down competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million in France Télécom for its anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephone by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still a state company has accumulated more than EUR 450 million in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivistic.
An application shop
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephony subsidiary followed the signs of other operators and opened a web app shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has contributed 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for the clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth positions of the clubs that have trapped the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income of major clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to reach the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams who also made the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with respect to the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex process of allocating money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
From this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (including the Atletico de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who succeeded in participating received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each game.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in eighths of the finals earn three million each, the eight teams who arrive in quarter of the finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, as part of fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça seized 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
In addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each TV market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive places.
The champion of the previous year ranks 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid on the basis of the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29,9 % of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the supply of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9 per cent of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for the totality of securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be paid in 10 years and which will be paid at 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended at EUR 1.85; New Rumasa's offer therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company has stated that it has contacted the regulator.
If necessary, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure his leadership.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible offers of purchase and of the govs and court comes from his former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as an internal audit director.
A decision made by the first woman to occupy a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the next few months His will reveal new diversions of funds cannot be left out.
Regarding the credit to Salazar, former Councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
NCMV authorizes the PAA of exclusion of Paternina submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Values Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the existing standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet submitted as a result of the changes applied on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95 % of social capital, consisting of 6 142,786 shares admitted to negotiation on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, and that they could in no way be transmitted prior to the completion of the offer, which he indicated that the price was set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of the repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of the parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
Calculate by hand the cost of repair between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100 percent of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, then to process them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competing companies in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car gets out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is very hard work, because each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and the price entered.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a tourism car is established.
If it is a model sold massively, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
In the case of a low-selling car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99 %.
In order to carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audadex has eight centres worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audadex invests 90 million per year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to provide different uses and offer various products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the countries, there are also tools for the management of broken parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that teaches about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex does not propose it in our country, but does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the kind of support it can give to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the light product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow for the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it has come out of the assembly chain, only through its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is an open-source server for the business sector on the Internet that allows to run on vehicles declared to be wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geo-demographic analyses, or know current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a specific brand went to the garage for a failure or how many suffered severe disasters for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.

Four-step garage work
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a quote in only four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are needed.
Once the model has to be repaired identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour prices, increases or reductions, and then can print the currency to deliver it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audatex works to make these images three dimensions.
This is an innovation that the mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
