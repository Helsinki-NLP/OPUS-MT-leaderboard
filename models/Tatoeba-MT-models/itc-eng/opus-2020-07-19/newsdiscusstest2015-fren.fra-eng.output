UKIP remains who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use special arguments, then you discredit them with a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to tail behind some chronic hypocondria intolerant who think everything is due them.
I think you're the one who's using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing fences, does not exist virtually.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A citation from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
Mail didn't write the report, he just made it comment.
Those controlling the majority of the media in this country should be shot for propagating such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
Neither do you know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence has been very surprising, but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to make it happen.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rarely said because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection of their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something of good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the austerity period, nothing has been done.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland was the 'TIGRE OF EUROPE' which we boasted a few years ago.
We've known the next one!
This starts reading the article again.
It is attempting to make Ireland believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ''New Economic MIRCLE' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, imposed on the lowest companies in Europe, a three-fold process of labour, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients, don't worry about '' paving''' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the 20th century, Illance was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with the Portuguese, considering a constant perimetre, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development was not a long calm river, it is upon the sight of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on the real taxes paid by multinationals.
If a report is believed to be released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that the road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, and the recovery is evident in the daily loops since the return.
Is it supposed to be economical?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon be on fire.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hangover on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to the next in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of appliances, so some bags and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That says I fly with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two once it's reconstituted.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair have to pay passengers an extra fee for the additional fear they were offered?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give each other a great deal of joy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic tariff have only to take it themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate the passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was an error of the airport air controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your compensation dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and gruels literally of the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of the restaurants (some of them, mostly) or for the Salon de la revue at the Space des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With a lot of foreigners who spend...
Do you think Sunday's opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, bought with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is clouded by the fact that they buy in retail.
Tourism areas lose a considerable turnover each year for the same reasons .
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, lower prices.
Dominal rest is a right for employees, with the exception of workers.
That is why it is prescribed and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister in charge of the economy, nor, of the rest, the minister in foreign affairs, has the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
As soon as they're looping it.
What's the use of the law?
Satisfying part of the population and businesses who wish to work on Sundays .
In Montreal on Sunday a.m. I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30,000 people where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
That is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's succession was, against her will, to use to pay the inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
Surely his succession would like his part of the cake, if you pass the expression to me.
his preference for a nationalist/Franco victory in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He stood up to the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis and he won very skillfully.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and his energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had for these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That its descendants sell the paintings on the free market to gather the money from the inheritance fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one of them in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the moment of truth," Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, since infrastructure sites are by definition unrenewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they well reflect the true French bad: mistrust for dialogue
Return to main values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either we come to his aid, or he has DROIT in exchange for the services he renders or has made a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the dancer who lives on the incomes of his property.
There is a need to differentiate the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives on his rents.
A property to rent or two for a couple on top, it's vice
The little genius of Finance is particularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortage in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, therefore, a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a savage decline so brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is screaming: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc.
Taxation that promotes high incomes and rents.
Who's in charge?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallop.
Samsung's profits are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors from the same range
The introduction in mid-September by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all those phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's sake.
I believe that it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft set up this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we have all different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like design.
Some people attach no value to design, for them options, functionality and price first.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform."
Is there a "best car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing portable industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and needs to be encouraged.
That's what we're all interested in.
I'm glad you found out exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men ( on the contrary, well on Parisian bobos) could tell us which author they are fighting ideas about gender and tell us the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Present Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're someone who's smart and cultivates.
I said this about Judith in the vineyard of Furusato referring to Holoherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I don't have her vibrity of mind).
Otherwise, in the background, since you send it back, I'm not interested in this subject, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I was hoping you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow, but I understand...
@ Jean: recognize that, culturally , send Judith back to Holopherne , it does.
Who's afraid to ask the world?
But what are we afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us feedback.
The first by invoking Judith from the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat sawmiller.
You can see how much these studies affect the most intimate of their homes.
We are obviously no longer in the debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read,Jean,that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to sources.
To fight ideas from the sole exposure of their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our friend on the sidelines, it's all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not about that he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic cutter of the throat, I was content with the "Second sex" (it was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon showed up briefly when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little the disappointment of having sometimes the sight blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would actually cover the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey making Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will make it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the Perseid meteor rain and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena in recent years.
I'm beginning to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
Anyone who looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he (must) disappears?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed with EUX.
Beautiful picture of the moon over Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing on inequality between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Extra liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext link to the original documents so you can get an opinion.
Let us see today on Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miraculous revenues: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece the stock exchange collapsed.
However, these are the examples to be followed.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Department of Economics says that these claims are not based.
What if the Ministry of Economics is wrong?
Will the decision-makers who have embarked on the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
The suite in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL.
@lol No. the State is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget because the temporal horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is wiped out by the life of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered to be unproductive, the latter contribute to the financing of material and immaterial investments that are key to future growth and therefore future revenue.
Some of the answers.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrat: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth does not correspond to your ghost.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands related to the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than risky surgery, safe shoot rooms for drug users rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the masses.
In fact, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
doctors don't make money with drugs Since Liberals want our health system to look like the one in the United States, you should learn how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the tubibians, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of businesses and to "research".
So read the few reports on our expenditures of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare world drug prices everywhere, as well as differences from country to country on what is on sale free or only on prescription.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that restrain them and the expensive permits required.
Although manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy to use alternatives such as marijuana, those that can produce good quality products at known doses will benefit widely.
Sorry to tell you madame but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacists.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the spark in the ear of a hospital manager.
We can't have patents on grass...
If "investigators" in social sciences did research instead of politics and networking, they could use their "work".
One researcher investigates, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
Compare is not looking.
Comparing is doing no research pedagogy.
You can't say "search is successful you have to apply it" and then in the same jet "you have to try everything out."
If your research was successful, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why do you ask for them to be applied?
Can you explain to me how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn when they learn how to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they did not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the use of building an indicator that informs you of what's going on, self-promotion, deception?
A single way to train teachers: to move away from training sophists and ideologies and that practitioners teach practitioners.
fabrication connects the paragraph on the internships (which is not highly argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads primarily to the reproduction of existing practices, and does not allow us to advance the system."
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it is not desirable that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have all their place in modern teacher training
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who never set foot in a previous operating block?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to the theorists of education would ultimately destroy it.
Your analogy is totally fierce: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and has learned about it.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative Member for the fight against copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thank you, MDR.
If one day I begin to feel guilty about violating copyright, I will just read an article like this one.
In an information economy, copyright violation = theft.
That's the same because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license doesn't cost anything.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing at all.
By using the content without the proper license, you deprive the artists of their winning bread.
You can always debate piling assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so true.
It is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start feeling guilty about violating copyright
This obviously doesn't bother you to deprive the artists of their incomes.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictional income.
Lesson No. 1 should show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have passed by one click.
Perhaps if they share their mp3 walkers with a boyfriend in the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we're so excited about, the raster who says everything is wrong....
If it is a PS Member who affirms it, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they are of choice, I would advise them to leave France if nothing had changed by now.
France shoots people down and continually assists them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down, these are the speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business ever since.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies led by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm employed because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the null patterns I often encounter.
At ease in my basketballs I fully share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he tells the horrible truth!
@gus, if compared with the German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises - What do French employers expect to do to do the same ??
Let the state hold their hands?
This state they accuse of impericy?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-company couple on your side!
Remember, you created yourself as a job, as a value added, to be as severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who are proud and minating while waiting for the permanent attendance of the state!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removing the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare claim the reduction of wages if not their removal!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What is ironic is seeing people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves floating rather than transforming themselves.
It doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do so, unfortunately.
I tried to get them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But, well, the Labour is going to get us bored, isn't it...
She's an international subsidiary.
They are already operating trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral enterprise and taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember scandals and criticisms when First won the Virgin contract, all of which for the decision to be finally canceled.
And there was better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and believes that all workers need to take advantage of the borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be pleased with this decision;)
This may be because Dutch management is on good tracks when British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not simply a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, the intelligence, the listening, for example, the fact of being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: "beating" cancers, who have not yet died, I know of beatings.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, we'll start over, too.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you this is AIDE.
Nothing to do with anything worth...!
When in the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'm starting again.
Insinuating, it would be only for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves, everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
Desiring to think otherwise, if, having strong morals will likely allow you to accept and prepare for heavy treatment more easily, try experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them out of fear..
Someone who's fighting medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine..
But if we prefer to hand it over to the "lord" it's something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch dirt, real shit, you get rid of yourself to become nothing but a zombie.
Personally I caught two of them, dirt, big ones, and if I got "beated" like those psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is just to tighten your teeth, to suffer from hell and to get the punches.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "fast" and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist who became a nationalist who waged three wars in the Balkans over the past decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ?
Please question what we have voluntarily left behind: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MOINDRE International Law Rule?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians, and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be endorsed by the West Compressor Roller.
The Westerners used a smokescreen to detach a part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was soon recognized by the Western States that then lied ultimately to the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as Tyran (even if we did not love him).
To my knowledge there is only in Greece a method of predicting the earthquakes is walking about, measuring the pézoelectric level in quartz.
This type of study is undoubtedly useful and thanks for sharing the results.
A hope therefore but caution is to put This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from the Earth in the Constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine from the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat.
Thank you Pastor of Science to reward us, often, with these experimental prowess that are realized in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably because of the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A a priori odourless gas for humans but may be detectable by animals.
All of these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments available to him.
But we don't have reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to earth's magnetic fields, and especially to their modification before a earthquake.
So of course I'm not scientific, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or is it about this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we speak of the "signs" given by the animals, we encounter in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I don't understand how we can think Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as the mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and always tries to have fun with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name one point.
He made so many promises to get elected as mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just highlights how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a piece of shit, isn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been taught the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him, and the same will be for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the Tories popularity rate will break the ceiling I'm sure of.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one
That's exactly what Londoners were saying.
He should have brought with him his friend the blinking, smarter than he
In some ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French have been really and always disinterested in the History of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the trouble to read a few books (there exists, including a French and excellent of B.
Millot), the "Solomons" and the "threat of iron" speak, unfortunately, as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there in the background since the Battle of Savo) have no desire to return there.
We are actually passed to the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even though the mission has come to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the echo side is a total smoke.
Calculate kerozen consumes to achieve the goal completely decredibilizes the concept..
Just go through the list of sponsors that philanthrops.
An operation of com no more and no more.
The cow, it gives too much desire!!!
I'm looking forward to the webseries!
Your account makes me reverberate, identifying me a little bit in the passage (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn au Moulin Blanc en rade de Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even though some criticize the impact of the displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep reversing us, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Bonsoir I think the red hat that has shown against taxes is pleased to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region of Brittany and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies should not devote a lump sum of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as those!
Are there players in the current Serbian training that is of kosovare origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly in Juventus and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
He's Bisevac, the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle of the field or before in the 1970s and 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as an attacker in the great Velez team who, under the supervision of the legendary Suleman Rebac, has finished two times in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had stitches like Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful crew of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was connected to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, and then he went to Fener and as much as I know he's not there.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone isn't the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which encompasses all areas where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there wasn't too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called the Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European Powers decided to give the country an end to the neighbouring countries.
How can we feel "an explosion of joy" by seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How?
What bothers me a little in this "witness" is that the only fact that we could have, would only, once, spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, bear witness to me to a "line bordering" personality whose all "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
It is likely that at the short time of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
It will just be thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in truly and apocalypticly harming the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
To make qqch powerful.
Great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who feel humiliated.
With filmed testimonies in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfraud.
We were wondering a little bit.
The West "Christian/Blanc/Gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general poverty, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the tours of Dubai.
The splendour passed, certainly embodied is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this evil darkness?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigating the Arab world: the bigot conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (dual or armed) of its critical expression.
That we understand before, we must not turn the Muslims back.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, the fall marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressed months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
The fall is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the breath in the fall.
Not as much to cut off breath as summer's green when everything is alive instead of dying.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, don't make your grunts that shorten clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to the germs outside, it can change, I suppose.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of intoxicating smells, with a febrility that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snowfall and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for the parties for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the control of child increases , it is the amount charged by the State that comes mainly from Deciles 8 to 10 .
However , as regards the number of households that have seen their tax increase following this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Chart 2 .
The removal of half of the widow's share in particular is not entirely treated in the article or rather its impact is entirely under assessment: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and assumes that it is painless.
And he's not ready to make it.
Well, we're not on straw though, but dreamers.
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we're not going to cry...
It is clear that those of the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let's continue this way and you'll encourage these 20% unless you work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I still say it.
Live Trots and OICs recycled at PS: they understand everything.
Adam, you look bad at what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from raising as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once money is spent, money is used only to make money, i.e. to do the greatest harm.
We're among the richest 20%.
Probably also 20% of the households that work the most (and create wealth of which a part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to enjoy part of their efforts.
Either so much lower arms and live social minimums, especially if you have a social housing.
The utopias of head cutters at the red Khmer have happily lived.
I made two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to present ourselves at the reception or face the slightest anxiety.
Just go to someone's house, sleep there, keep behind yourself and go.
This will now be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need a type of owner's insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Oh, 6 hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" It's not true.
You've just really missed a chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, the Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article mention Teman complain that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay a bill and a month's rent all at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Supporting the troops," sang the Bu$herie on all the tones...
Inoffensive weapons, then.
I am sure that it will please families and close to thousands of Kurds killed in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of hussein Saddam.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polished).
Furthermore, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not super clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Now is the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly enhanced if "they" worked 35 hours instead of 17.
At present, our teachers are currently earning more than engineers.
And we don't believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programs.
But this is not seen because the National Education does not have the means to provide an office to college/lycée to its teachers, so they work in their homes.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay either the computer, internet connection, or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the plan at 17h per week and 4 months of vacation that we can't complete the maths, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to get caught up in poorly educated clairvoyants whose parents spit on you while treating you as a jerk?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the people of Khurde can thrive better.
Where you can see the Bush administration has absolutely been through.
My first job graduated was in the sale, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a job that needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an ad to be working for the London subway, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, don't worry if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well, or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in my graduated job, I would still be paying my student loan.
I don't like business so much, so I hope eventually to go through either in the public service or in the academic world.
LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year arrears.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of bisounor lines such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is what we call the diplomas of unemployed.
I have one of these degrees and I'm finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma, but, as the article above says, a good career, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower, but the levels were rapidly rising because in the real world what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate on engineering/artistic careers has lasted for years.
Scientists can't solve all the problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people so that they can get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bison lines?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about media degrees or whatever the unknown line you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are true lines.
We need people who can explain the big questions to the high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Would it not be better for a real territorial policy to defuse Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the residents of the end of the Essene and Val-d'Oise make 80km back every day on bicycle to come to work in Paris.
Intra-mural and small-belt inhabitants already have many more practical means of transport in common (métro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and locked parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Unfortunately, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found room for a single bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not all right.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other common transport users the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that arise are: 1/ it is super dangerous with all these trucks, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and fuck off the survival of bicycles 2/ we take full pollution in the head For me the bike tracks are pis go, it is necessary to reduce the motor traffic (urban bird type congestion charge), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the road code by routinely verbalizing (even bicycles to be pre-adjusted the code of the written road for bathrooms 100 years ago), generalize the buffer areas after the clouded passages, not before the car and scooters do not generate.
The cycle tracks are apartheid, but the occupation of urban space must be rebalanced.
Nothing on the bike in the Grand Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bike in public transport?
EELV's right.
The target of 15% of veil movements is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
In addition to what OR reports, EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
I'm not sure I love the way the world's changing.
That sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
Moreover, they should file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect that these cases will be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation that would result from it.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for airspace security, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been killed earlier, Ukraine was launched into the area of air attacks against the rebels, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in the light of a clear threat or did it choose to play with the lives of innocents for airlines to pay overflew the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their usurper government / the Western Ukrainian ultranationalists - and who want to show by the way that Putin broke down MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their sky.
The previous: a 1986 decision of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the provision of arms by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Consents in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not allow this case to go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott means in Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators have said nothing like this.
Calling Ricardo and being such an eco-booty, it's heartbreaking!
Calling Polaris is losing the north is joyous.
One Bolotian question: Is today's poorer poorer than yesterday's poorer?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book the most repulsively didn't read it!
It's easy to read, I've had a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of production-income, capital-income, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that today's concentration of capital is joined by that of the early 20th before 1914, it shows that it was the 2 world wars that brought down the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long this has taken you to read this floor knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has a few limits.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is just or not.
If it is fair, it can be debated without having read the book which is essentially to argue in a single sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you spent reading it?
Is the central thesis of his Pavie summarized by the press false?
I didn't read it and I won't read it.
So I'm in line with the summary of his central thesis, and that's the one that looks pure fumistic.
The notion of a gap between the rich and the poor is subsidiary.
Didn't humanity become global rich?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and surely deserves the price.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of the Western governments who want to prove the old adage that the colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her much freedom but mentioned that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married to 14 years old.
Is Malala itself not part of these "colored perverts"?
You should not have any "antenna time" on this site.
You, yourself, are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when he was 14.
She was 15 when we shot her.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and she has the right to decide for herself about her marriage.
However, he is someone who is unusual in Pakistan, since he thinks women are equal to men.
What she was saying is that a middle Pakistani girl should often get married at 14 years of age without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't state it quite eloquently for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married to 14 years old.
Rather disappointed by this entry into season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a bit of trouble finding her character in Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I must admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the anachronic Life on Mars of Bowie is simply reversing.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last time for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I prefer to have just one shot than to look at 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is about, besides Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mainly the risks of staging and mounting that surrounded me.
In AHS there is an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the adaptation of today's productions.
It escapes me a little bit from seeing you throw your sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but you say so well, there are many other things.
It's just not that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside of technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series weighs by writing, it wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them do 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end up like 24 hours what.
But everyone does what they want.
It's by what I say, "I won't look anymore" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal.
But then, here, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less tax increases, please - rather cut into government spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to know about spending failed.
Initiate controversy about relatively minor expenditure posts, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that electors seem to call their wishes and for all this time certain, in each camp, make it seem that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and electors see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1 per cent of the expenditure.
The "debt" is from assets held primarily by financial institutions in that country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government taking up a third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to use it as a good idea.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to almost useless wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you get to a figure that makes Labour and Lib-Dem tax quite ridiculous about the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 pays around £70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vineyard, and it is before VAT.
Nearly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car vineyard.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not if it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that money falls from heaven, or that it's not important to know where billions of books of taxes are going.
How can a unemployed person who is looking for work at the door door prove it?
At the same time, 20% of the unemployed wouldn't be looking for, which means 80% are looking for and don't find.
As I'm unemployed, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances of doing so.
Indeed, I haven't had any news from Pelle Emploi for months, which means that the officers are more involved in control operations than actually getting job announcements back?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough posts, then you have to move away from Pole Emploi.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, and we are now making sure that the unemployed are doing their duty well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their title of transport to users of a means of transport, a head of service or are employees of their work, etc.
Nobody shouts at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is worth recalling that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with the Pole Employment, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not a law expert.
Registration and control is currently taking place, while Pôle Emploi is legally close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only the employees, who pay the fees.
Politicians and French non-employed people are granted rights they do not actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance is involved in the promotion of wage labour.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this zone of conflict.
The situation would then look like the spread of black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban this year the Hadj in Mecca from the Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have received their visa application refused because of their country of origin or their recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who hired the smallpox at Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent the sick of Ebola from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was simple sense but apparently those who "know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be strictly quarantined.
Nobody gets out.
Only health personnel can come in.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after contact with people in West Africa, although they took "all necessary precautions".
The progress of this disease can be stopped.
It is mainly propagated by airlines.
Let's stop them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be immediately put into quarantine.
May he pass the message of the first individual and of the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace.
I doubt he is capable of erecting in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far from that design here.
It's only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given premium of humanity, while the religion, coming from the brain, leads our actions from Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any way put their feet to the Church, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sory the church does not have a limited vision in France.
And in the world, maybe it will allow you to touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envisioned it pre-existing to the Christ.
Hillel had already said to him: "Don't do to others what you don't want to do to you, that's all the Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces the agape.
Your "progressing justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain the hero who has disturbed moral laws by redefineing the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to take their place in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and converted by force and pushed into immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game comes out soon.
It's not inventing.
I would personally choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even took part in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll look.
Of course not at work.
The joys of the computer department block all the nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 and 20% reduction, or do the £30 include the 20% reduction?
Attention however: PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *fucking*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam identifier, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they will erase it from your library if they decide to serve against the people who buy it there while they're out of the area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France in 1940 a "childish land"?
So say, this Nobel prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Must we love France, 40, the one of "the strange defeat"?
When we see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature we wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano who is already hard to read in French and who describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso only have a distant relationship with literature.
Did you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will be able to appreciate M.
Modiano's just worth, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to visit Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who obtained the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hail to the terrible.
Ever since I drove one to Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sportage anywhere.
I think this thing's been following me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like the horrible Superman III computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cider party.
It was brothel.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mixing of people there, there were only fans of CAMRA (not to confuse with the fanatics of the camera).
Driving back on Sunday was really tough.
On Monday night we went to a guy's grandfather's house to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of beginner I was able to go with several decent sets.
I hope if I reach 95 I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of bark on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you're a little far from the subject.
This famed whole, it forbids the quests for the Jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
She immediately reports arms trafficking.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping the eyes closed that we access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental counter-sensus: all representative, Muslim or non-Muslim authorities, organizations or associations, having formally condemned the IS and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who doesn't say consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, some doubt the Jewish French approval of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and inaccurate to accuse them a priori and demand that they publicly manifest themselves to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt.
This principle is in my view the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the deletion of French society.
If there is no doubt, as much.
Who doesn't say consent, but consent to what?
Consent to a proximity with EI or to the II conviction.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to care for goats and goats.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified with the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland since they have no seat.
They can do whatever they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the losing Labour seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term good thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's gonna pour a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads to the north.
Ed Miliband joined the " PROMISE" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death penalty for his Scottish MPs.
Not surprisingly, some Labour MPs are demanding accounts from their leader.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in the parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Sealing 8% pumps at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
Furthermore, once the Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists, and it did him well.
Yet he is still in high school to be prime minister in 2015 and since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, by the way, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "the life of others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Still the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, at least this will have a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon manufactures your book according to your profile and it automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
He's gay as a world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I continue to read stolen files, public domain books or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to propose files without moschard.
Given the price I paid Kobo, it's no regrets.
I am aware of the widespread abdication of users to the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
In your general public bookstore, you will notice systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably ridiculous.
For example » Finnegans Wake » by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Big Data era, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put the whole literature in the same bach.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
Harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that enables neither the readers nor the authors to identify them.
But Kobo has all this information, him.
There have been so many exaggerated, misleading and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government over the past few days that the country seems to be headed by a class of motherhood full of schizophrenic children under acid.
It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some Erdogan partisans think Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot a ball in the foot unless there's something to win.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it is actually to shoot a ball in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent there a serious warning of reprisals or whether it merely advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment to Syria, Israel and the security of the region is concerned."
The reading of Indian Punchline is strongly recommended to anyone who pays close attention to the details rather than to the c*neries balanced by the traditional media. The short article of which you give the link is important and should be read keeping in mind Iran's previous realistic observations/warnings proposed by Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who seriously fight the horrible lay Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy moves the world towards abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to "moderate" non-existent to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to the Third World War.
"It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks was needed.
Should he?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the least chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my buddy...
Wouldn't the criminals be just old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, huh?
Especially concerning the Triumvirate of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a place planted in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there and dreamed of founding a Turkish empire there.
How dazzling!
An impressive master of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real one.
That clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that even beats in the womb of a carrying mother.
Lesbian couples may simply be a desire for a child and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterilous couples too.
As for the children!
How shameful to designate them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives, and to pay for this lady's retirement (?)
The GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
She doesn't date today.
Many women have brought and brought into the world children who were not their husbands.
It is still so, we are so made...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "marchandization" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, the cosmetics aren't the same commodification of the bodies?
Aronik Fareinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good in faraway country via the internet and Pay Pal than to put up his responsibilities and avoid scandal in another century near home without screaming at that time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done on behalf of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
By the end of the 70s in the Midlands, I saw this only from a distance.
I had to go there for the day because I didn't have the right to go there at night!
But if you love that and you listen to music - this music today always touches you as much.
I don't know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason says, perhaps they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on the football that awaits your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of North England's culture.
No wonder that Paul Mason has taken a good look at the social and political context, he understands things.
Northern Soul still lives, but it has been vamped by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can throw an ear if you're in the London region in November: 99psoul will once again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here's a little article well written and well thought out.
your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I suppose you're happy to have escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Victoria/Exchange Wigan and get off to Wallgate.
They taste pills.
Whatever the pre-wigan station was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after you bought a ticket to stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently Police Series, Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (and this was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative rose in anger and voiced: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) said and added: and now that things were clearly established
Israel and the majority of its people have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower the guard ...
That this applies to anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the sought-after goal ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it has always been this way since the policy is globalized...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-Colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What force report has allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
You doubt that?!
Besides, it doesn't just work around Russell Brand, but Guardian reporters seem to have trouble going beyond anything that he doesn't have to say.
Much of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyist billevises written by no other.
That proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a suite of personal attacks and innuendos (my 13-year-old daughter loves her well, which would mean that it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand says certain truths, perhaps of the truths we prefer not to think about.
Hold on, this feeling will be becoming more and more common!
I can understand why Brand horripile certain: he sometimes speaks in a pretentious manner and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a populist beginner, but all this story of not voting was completely misunderstood from me.
The general consensus seems to be that he just tells people not to vote and rather to cross arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles/videos he has posted, he says that voting once every five years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting the democratic commitment to this is completely unnecessary, both parties (in slightly different degrees) governed mainly in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and wealthy, at no time he says simply ignore politics because these parties do not govern on our behalf: he insists that instead of just vote and disconnect for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, little matter and try to influence politics from that point on.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that I am politically active in presenting his requests can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are swirling people who will change their opinion if they really risk losing the elections), but it is a rage to see all these condescending answers that say that this idiot who makes Jesus tell young people not to take the trouble to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were to debate what it really says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of it and a large number of people left on its own.
Yes, thank you.
The matter on the vote was completely distorted.
The needless to slip a ballot in a poll every 5 years makes me very angry, since my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members of Parliament who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own ideas and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the type of thinkers and unestablishment universities from the counter-culture Suzanne would like to group under the label "fun-chomskyists billevesées".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, even with the head holes added to the mounting!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russel but eventually became one of his fans and invited him into his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It derives from a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
In my view, this "floating" shows that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDVs of the History where business historians have become minority and where exchanges of specialists have fallen to the advantage of pre-pensing type Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude as well as Michel Foucault's, a need to take care of a culprit, an emissary bouquet.
They develop both of the very rational reasonings, but this rationality is based on these emissary bouquets that are the key to the vault of their thinking.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
It comes from a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magic thought.
The problem of the report is solved by removing it.
There is an anarchist slope, neo-lib and / or libertarian ( the second term marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to go to seek the state's help for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
His thinking is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it does not stand.
Whoever says he's guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Not even support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of its god of then, Stalin, the little father of peoples.
Oula, you have probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apologizing of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer enjoy attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he is an original and respectable thinker.
See this cabal orchestrated by hard left human science researchers who do not support the passage of relief to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is without limit.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebells", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were kind to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think so about the whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the mid-20th century, and I still hear some of them hold violent anti-whites statements.
My father's not happy his eldest daughter was with a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spreads out of big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I was told, the Russians are mainly prejudiced against temporary workers with no qualifications originating in the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the Australians' opinions about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), didn't keep a bad memory of them, all people were brave and, in fact, those in London were very kind is the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
If we don't remember who we meet, all people are brave, how we remember who we were.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of Chinese as kind of a unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with Whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Blanches would assault them PHYSICALly.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet she is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups marked to the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the judicial circles are frankly branded right.
When at the Judicial Union, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
The one from the observer's political vision as from the judge's factual interpretation.
It remains the required tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on fundamentals.
The extent of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, makes it possible to distinguish between the error and the bias of magistrates.
It would be pointless to claim that the acts of justice were not divided between these three groups.
Pretentation and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
What if this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice improves in France?
If only through statistics revealing implicitly that it is going from low to low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The one from corruption* of the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area concerned is that of the spoiling* of heirs committed up to the means of fraud to the procedure* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession obtains EUR 150 million in good year, while receiving coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notary.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where it joins the so-called statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogicalist and reticent heirs, a whole set of case-laws contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring these kinds of rational criteria, then, not an elaborate form of lie?
Totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to crush the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these tricycles all land, built to measure its size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the full air as never a normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, could not.
As we say, the tastes and the colors...
The Tankchairi resembles what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks epic.
I think the Whill inventor never had to clean a dog's hook on a kennel.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all land, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for the longboard.
Here are the hills that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so "you see."
The tricycle of any terrain seems particularly useful to me.
Not all persons with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have insurance at their disposal of a reasonable amount.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know that they are necessary for us.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not planned to make it.
I'm CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't get on the market, because there's apparently no way to drive that thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been imprisoned in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockades!
A unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, also illegal, since this blockade inflicts a "collective punishment" on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit from their cement to the black market " ...
That's not the tongue of wood, rather concrete and armed the lady...
References are here to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been imprisoned in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, unacceptable for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The USA has a well-preserved land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Don't forget that when you lifted it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built on the back of the population that chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've been thinking well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the economy of sharing, without profit.
Many are looking only for one night on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hopefully) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and trusted tenants often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all that?
"What does she rent on?"
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, if you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have good insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% in accordance with all the safety rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers to do business there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (with all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that ships can be moved, stolen and repelled, sunk, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if anyone tried to steal it she would always be near where you left it.

Where are you going to hang him?
No Marine Le Pen isn't right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth among the wealthiest hands is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to collapse!
High finance, speculation, plays with our companies, so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food, with our healthcare structures, so our health, with our debts.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obsessed money.
To the contrary, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was 2012.
In 2014, he became an economic minister of the Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of bankers, only those responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else competing?
What do you call it, return his jacket, lower his pants?
Primary response and populist
Actually, we don't know much about Marine Le Pen.
Where did you see this?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I am not sure that Spee has really "refused" to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British sewing in the area.
The sea was horrifying at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malouins, where, on the photos showing the survivors being dried, we see a calm sea and in the middle of the day.
Moreover, rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two curated cruisers, who had disappeared into the black after stopping the shooting, and a race-for-a-speed began.
Leipzig saw something in the fire, but when he got close, he saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and sees the Monmouth, hung and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his spotlights on the ship's flag, the proposal to go was refused and he opened the fire, finally casting the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee considered that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 22.15.
Concerned about reports indicating a British sewing in the surroundings, he set out north."
So, if this is true, the Germans, in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had flown, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important cure of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in the confusion they were outlawing to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should cross a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and had cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes were raised at the UMP to request that it be included in the law for a definitively sentenced election to be thus permanently ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch the left-wing electors well on.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR SOME IDEA, I PROPOSED A CRIMINATION TO ALL MAGISTERS' CONSULTATIONS
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated among citizens?
Maintained by politicians (es) whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to soften those same ones who will take advantage of their inmovability to hinder the actions of true policies, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is sufficient.
I met them in the subway about noon with their little banners" of bass for justice" they came from province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if trade unions on the right, or even on the far right, were targeting the people on its edge and waging a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are totally free.
If, at the moment, the right side is defraying the court matter, it is simply that it has committed facts that bring about it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality that has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have paid attention to it have not had favorable treatment.
On the other hand, it should be remembered that the judicial union on the left is not the only judicial union and that it is a minority.
A minister's strong support for trade unions shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you are quoting may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in Chancellery, it is not a secret.
We are now wondering whether the "mission" of certain judges is not more to come out than to instruct.
@gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Wassel.
I think even the faintest of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Directions fill the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of disks or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is, in fact, part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision competition, as well as many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and the rest participated in US competitions.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars on British television.
Of course, some have fallen into forgetfulness.
But that is what happens anyway to most stars who do not participate in the competitions.
Rare are those who, after a tube, manage to do other things.
In any case, most singers/groups can expect at best three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, whatever his name is, has just fans in the UK.
Her celebrity comes in part from her wedding with a footballer who breathes through her mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical way of rock, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar friars that smoke grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a poem primary school will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – distance that turns fast enough to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present us these distant people as infinitely superstitious and petri of ritual mousterie, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, from practical considerations to daily.
Unless you interpret unwisely in the opposite sense.
But rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our manner is as reminded of the sacred as a sort of well-defined and circumscribed object to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article no matter what.
It's the ephemeral deco to mutilate the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred always lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would lead to not all scientists' interpretations that last the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When does a comparative criticism of disciplines make us laugh a little bit?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasure is constantly discovered, precious testimony to reconstruct history, to understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today there are such powerful technical and scientific means that the interpretation of searches is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
There is controversy (and old) about the shamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf his book "Lessanas de la prehistory", especially the enhanced re-editation of the scientific controversy, published in La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this article highly instructive
Heter men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put myself there.
So it's over with us?
I don't really understand why can't we go on to three?
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canyon?
No, but we're not against a play on it.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy over there, but it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, then I suggest you move to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all search for a newspaper that pays for real journalists, brave, to write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and dangers.
Rather than making these pouty ass jokes ring.
Not very smart.
Go on, then.
If these "puerile ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this paper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case that of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, it would have taken out the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g., a vehicle) would have entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew it was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (telephone, pub, money...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I also share that opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM gets the SC in, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to beat the English that was then leading...
You leave my dear Dayrton on this blog.
But it's not serious, I've got a little time to figure out all your c*****ries.
No, just not.
There have been lots of conspiracy in F1, but never one that puts Commissioners in danger of death for a long history of a pilot's chance of victory at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out safe because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In view of amateur images, the absence of an image allows the AIF to avoid embarrassing questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner shakes a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the AIF blocks the images of the accident but because we clearly see one of the Commissioners shaking a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are more under yellow flag.
Some comments show a dark disregard of the F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag APRES the place of the accident, from where the green flag shakes.
It's the usual procedure.
The post of commissaries just downstream of the accident (as the case may be, 10 meters as at 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism sells pubs.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that, in the end, it's just money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having sex, the pub and the media are good for selling things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The info do exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information we don't really need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so we can keep controlling them.
"When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear" This should be "derailing", not "slaughtering".
In view of the medical reference, "touching" is much better said in this context than "derailing".
I wonder if all the people who are worried that Ebola could spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that mocks beautifully and firmly this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
I feel depressed that the media are talking about most of the things with this optimism in the opposite direction.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without going to hysteria) so that the government can tear us apart when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven cases?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Is there not something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still from this world almost 35 years later.
In addition to the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going through it for years .....
Testimony perfectly useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimony of nothing: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot serve as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we are abstaining from asking patients in psychiatry when reliable observations are made from close relatives.
My psychiatric record says my psychiatric mother explains that I was educated telepathically by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's crazy, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is not useful in a scientific approach?
So what are you researching on, then?
On ghosts?
Are you putting the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the word canon adulated by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D'ensemburg.
@Jim: There are plenty of meaningless buzzwords at the psys.
Cyrulnik gave us the "resilience".
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have broken a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the air sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not *no* good idea to show up the Sentinels of the air...
So why?
It was a great series, and it seems to me that those who have come up with it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the all-powerful who can perform miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the humorous genus pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The kids were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So keep your America Team.
Still in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if you do not see the children and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (though an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to spread the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we have episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 06:00.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can always see it at these times.
And then the half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a sad 60-year-old guy, but I'm not watching this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists is elsewhere.
Can it be in Argentine??
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the splandle of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or Dome of Rocher, is out in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad is set up in paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham nearly sacrificed his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remember it regularly, and unfortunately they are connected to the government (Naftali Bennett, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan in 2 states, and tasted it continuously!).
It is also useful to show how far Jerusalem's annexation is not a peaceful fact.
Will God recognize his people?
The shortest of Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
To boast the tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naïdas to half-witnesses, English on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary though.
And this picture is a magnificent piece of propaganda!
It is a pity that the photographer of Reuters did not take photos of the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to enter the Mount of the Temple and who prefer to silence the Jewish faithful in contrabas, praying to the Wall for lamentations.
@Mat, If this picture bothers you, it's right, it's neither the newspaper nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that we must condemn.
This system is untenable and will end up crying.
The only way to put an end to this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to have gone bankrupt, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever more important remuneration to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of laughing and groaning when someone else makes the strike, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also show your employer that we don't go unpunished.
Unless democracy is abandoned, if so, it is safe.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where the social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
All this can't end well.
It's because we're in democracy that's been held up.
Have you voted for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Partnership for Trade and Investment (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people in short-circuited by secret tribunals to national governments.
This seems unbelievable, but that is exactly what the investor-State dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we're starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
That's what makes excellent impacts, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th there were unions in all regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let (at last, his officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe in the safe of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and shut its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of the Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more uncomfortable...
They still miss you the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else yet
If you don't write the French correctly, I'll make a union.
You've been warned, it'll be your fault.
In order to defend the interests of the categories, there are already enough protected professions with trade unions, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of an employee.
We can well imagine a system that guarantees a certain freedom of expression without unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
No disaster assured.
And with the carts that are preparing, the government welcomes this.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here...
Let's delete "through his delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and business management".
This is absolutely essential with the disruption of computer power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review".????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding that I've been watching, and I can tell you that some people have been well-seasoned.
In Joffrey's wedding episode we have one of the best moments (what is misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the worst baker; no one has made "boum, here my fucking cake now boil it and bow before your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure of friends and relatives out finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all of these outsiders were kept away.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears the last week.
I like cooking, but I don't think I can handle this.
I am grateful to those who do so and offer us super entertainment and encourage us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015 !
I agree, the last challenge last year, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually spend days doing them, and they had to scramble one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to start, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real fault they could have found was the a bit dry base (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green glaze on Richard's mill would not give you any desire, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem somewhat artificial because of the time spent.
There is also the cancer that looks, with solar wind blows.
It is determined that everything is going to succeed at this time.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is mainly blocked by the ozone layer that is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "wrest" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and thus less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man, they are in the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVC and allows the UVA and most UVB to pass.
Do you know that you don't have to be condescending and view your interlocutor as a rest when you post a comment?
Especially for minor accuracy, which was implied in the commentary, which he himself intends to be pedagogic.
Without saying that I am a melanoma habit, UV only makes ACCELAR its development.
They don't persuade him.
For evidence: not all bronzed persons do not necessarily have melanomas.
Either, when a tubib tells you that you must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because the UV is necessary for all humans.
Excess, on the other hand, is like this: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause melanoma.
Can we bend it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have determined that everything can be folded if there is sufficient force and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use to which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and it has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as communications equipment in the front line.
But for others,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested have determined that everything can be folded if a sufficient force is applied to it.
Except a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
This is a joke in every discussion.
I've decided to count them.
It's the fourth joke about the fold I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before specific software is installed, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we see little of how it could come back there.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......................................
The most likely thing is that it is a production unit on which the iOS was not installed properly and which is therefore matched with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or EC logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah l article for bobo par par par excellence.
We want cheap products and we're surprised that industrialists produce in » industrials' We put forward super u but all the teachings and even the small trade are concerned How to eat good, bio avac €1650 (average salary in francs)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his priorities where he hears it.
For my part, the diet is one.
Come on, no offense, I'll kiss you.
It is called bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It's the total thought-reason degrouping.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tarturia, joining the left-caviar, of which they are sometimes coming, for example by condemning CO2 releases while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuferie, too, are not surprised to meet often criticisms about them.
Wauh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theory as well as for all associated details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
And well, you're able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were to be interested in the ecosystems at any time.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the echoes because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front.
She's so badly hurt that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth of this work.
But you just didn't have any legitimacy to comment because you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin doesn't know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really succeeded in becoming fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That's not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic dog reproductions that smoke by playing billiards.
Judging art may be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than simply representing the real one.
If you're looking for that, a camera will do the case.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are still some savings: riding activities, the number of Republican guards horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
(honesty is obliged to say that France is lowering its staff, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drasticly, to begin with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, he finds his limits quickly!
A unique approach, at a time when we observe weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow to the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
@edmond: that's what I was saying, look elsewhere to make savings but especially not at home, home is really not possible...
That's exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
That all those who have sided little or enough the military thing dare come to say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no money spent in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
Applying the same potion to the entire public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why Defence can feel a little busy!
Well, yes, the economies on which everyone agrees to say that they have to be done, must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moaning at murder when it happens to them, poor darlings.
It would have to be done, but above all, because in this case it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, come on!
How will closing the Grace Valley weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, the story is repeated at every post closure, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not enjoy the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most harrowing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad jokes.
It's the depression to show his Facebook thread and to see that 80% of his friends started their statutes with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're going to make a movie.
It will probably be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus going to work and realizes only where his skirt has returned to his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely messed up.
Not really, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
There's no computer.
God, I have to watch this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really just demonstrated that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm going back!
It is absolutely necessary for me to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the lighting and discover the incredible shine and the insurmountable genius that leaps from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
God, it was really empty.
Especially if they are neither women nor transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows positive developments within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and partnership initiatives.
Until further notice, we are given the right to save our planet by states that play the truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things into our hands.
With the Commissioner they have planted energy, all these beautiful recommendations have flown...
Translate: Windmills and solar farms are the round points of tomorrow.
All financed by the taxable person.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of waste and in case of accidents.
As long as the chain is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, it drastically reduces our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions ?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other stages.
Electricity by wind renewable energy or PVC is already more GES on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittentness.
Replace nuclear with wind or PVC renewables would be against CO2 control.
Christial I do not insult you I am a State Doctor in physics 1981 and I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove otherwise what I have said.
For what I didn't say, you're the one who lend me ideas. I didn't say anything about Germany. You didn't actually answer what I was saying, and like everyone on the right is tearing down the interlocutor, I never do.
I also refer to the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a non-profit and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count the greenhouse gas vapour of less effect than the Co2 is true remember the two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part of water vapour and a little in river water.
I stopped reading when you spoke about Pakistan as a "genant of South Asia" ...!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had qualified India as a giant in South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandore full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, Kolkata's Athletic imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
Compared to the billions that India spends on the IPL cricket and now on football, how could we one day compete with our "single neighbours"...
The low cost runner race pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible lack of design is revealed only with too cold helium.
So we may not be in a design flaw, but in implementation...
unlike arianspace that is a private society, it seems that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as the state here is its own insurer..
They may be paying for the frigate satellites they know..
This is all the more annoying than many media loops the only titles of articles - and many readers only retain these titles.
In total this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
While agreeing with you, the title is not appropriate, it is unfairly challenging the project while it is only a launch problem.
