Martelly swore in the new Council of the Temporary Elections (CEPs) that had nine members yesterday.
This is CEP five Martelly in four years.
Last month a president's commission gave a previous recommendation for the resignation of the CEP as part of the calculation package to move the country to a new election.
That check was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-resistence protest that started in October.
Protests that are sometimes triggered by elections scheduled to be held since 2011.
Reported 60 iPods malfunction cases marked with a device too hot, causing six fire cases and four victims of light burns.

A study published in the journal Ilmiah on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species on the island of Galípagos Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations.
Gold can be turned into various forms, and small forms of gold.
Gold can be drawn into thin wires, so it can be crossed and it's covered. It can be forged or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made very thin, and fit into other metals. It can also be made thin once and for all so that sometimes it is used as decoration of hand paintings in a book called "light-filled inscription".
It's called a chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Kubis juice changes color depending on the acid or the base of the chemical.
The pH level is shown by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in tested chemicals.
Hydrogen Ion is an electron that has been removed (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Add both dry powders to one, then the rice becomes ball-balls with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hand will react with the outer layer, which will be funny and form some sort of shell.
The city of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have a ciram toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated waste disposal system.
Relicing the disposal system was found in many houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There are also toilets in Egypt, Persia, and ancient Turkkok, and in Roman civilizations, the toilets sometimes come together with a public bathhouse, where men and women use it together.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, then you use satellite.
Satellites in outer space receive calls and then replay it, almost for a while.
The satellite is sent to outer space by rockets, the scientists use telescopes in outer space, because the Earth's atmosphere changes some of our light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket of over 100 feet to place satellites or telescopes in outer space.
The biggest thing that has been done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It's taking us to the train, the car, and a lot of other transportation.
Cat's sized under it is preying on a sized animal, such as rabbits, antelopes and deer.
The last one is that there are many small cats (including care kittens) that eat far more small prey like insects, farm animals, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the circular concept, the special work that every cat employs to keep them from competing with other cats.
The lion is the most social cat, living in a large group called prey.
Pride consists of one to three adult males, along with 30 females and their children.
She has often been closely linked to each other, including the large family of Christian sisters and daughters.
Lion Pride acts like a flock of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to a lion (but not another big cat) in his behavior, and also extremely deadly to his prey.
As a floating athlete, a tiger can climb (even if not very expert), swim, jump at a distance, and attract 5 times more powerful than humans.
The tiger is still one group (Genus Panthea) with lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The sound of a tiger is not like the sound of a lion, but more like the speech of a lion, the sound of a scream.
Ocelot likes to eat little animals, ocelot will catch monkeys, snakes, feeders and birds if possible, almost every animal that is hunted is much smaller.
Scientists assume that ocelots follow and search for animals to be eaten through kisses, smelling traces of prey on the ground.
And they saw it clearly in the darkness of the night, and they moved quietly.
When a small group of living creatures is separated from the main population of origin, as if they move to the mountains or rivers, or if they move to the new island so that they cannot easily return, they will often find a different environment than they had previously placed.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so new populations need different features or adaptations to be more powerful than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, when new populations begin to adapt to their new surroundings, they seem to be shrinking like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations would look very different until they could not be called the same species.
We call it a specialization process, which means the development of a new species, a species that is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
They produce oxygen that is excreted by humans, and they take out carbon dioxide that man brings out, which means breathing.
The plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis, they also provide a shade.
Most of the food we eat is vegetation, not plants that cannot survive.
Moses is the great predator of the day, and he is not afraid of anything except his brother.
Its long-acting bones are covered with more than 70 teeth, and it is followed by extra fingers on the top of its mouth, and there is nothing to escape through it.
We don't know for sure, but it's likely that his tongue will be branched, and it's also food, a big fish, a little bit of mosquitoes, and maybe it's cannibal for a long time.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, including the giant dinosaurs like T. King, unable to match it.
Although most of their food is not foreign to us, the Romans do indeed have a share in strange or unusual party food, including pigs, peacocks,
Another difference is that when the poor and the woman eats a meal while sitting on a chair, the rich enjoy a meal together and relax and eat their food.
Ancient Roman food cannot bring food to Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they have no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolates; nor have any ancient Romans ever tasted turkeys.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the house of a god.
People would sacrifice to the gods and priests would strive to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple and a holy place within which only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes a special pyramid-shaped tower, called ziggurat, was built as a temple.
The upper part of the tower is a place of special protection for the gods.
In the Middle East climate, the house is not so important.
For the most part, the Jewish family is out - of - doors.
Women cook in the yard, stores used only open counters facing the streets, stones used to build houses.
There's no big forest in the land of Canaan, that's why wood prices are so expensive.
In the Nordics, it was said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as a result of the murder, and when he went west he found Greenland and named him Greenland.
However, apart from the discovery, the Eskimo tribe had lived there at that time.
Even though every country is Scandinavia, there are many differences between people, kings, traditions and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever watched the National Treasure film, you might think treasure map written behind the Declaration of Independence.
Though it is written behind it, this document is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written "Real Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776." Text appears in the bottom of the document in reverse."
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of the large film document (size 29Â3⁄4 inches 24Â1⁄2 inches) was rolled up to be kept.
So, that note is likely to be inserted as a label.
D-Day landing and next battle has freed the northern part of France, but the southern part is still not free.
They were Frenchmen who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with explorers instead of fighting them.
The allies invaded the south of France on August 15, 1940.
In only two weeks the U.S. and French Merdeka forces have freed the southern French and moved to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture that is carried out together by a group of people who live and work together, as a society.
The word civilization comes from civilist Latin, which means civilians, related to civil Latin, which means citizens of the country, and the city, meaning cities or cities, and it also makes a huge measure of society.
The cities are the people of the nations. The culture of civilization refers to the destruction of knowledge in several generations, the remaining traces of culture, and the rational preaching.
Minority culture usually disappears without having left relevant historical evidence and failed to recognize it as a decent civilization.
During the Revolution War, the first thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress as the only component of the "€" under the Confederation Pass-Pasal.
Congress has no power to charge taxes, because there is no executive or national auditory, Congress relies on the state authority, which is often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
He also does not have the authority to block tax and tax laws between the state.
They need a round-the-counter agreement from all states before they can be changed, while the countries don't move the central government so their representations are often absent.

The most popular winter sports in the North, with Italians competing in international games and Olympics.
The Japanese have almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu) so that Japan has the largest island in the world.
"As a classer/head of a Japanese island, Japan in the geographical term often referred to as an island"
The beginning of Taiwan began a long time since the 15th century when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Formosa Island, or a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a base in South Taiwan, and practiced transformations in local grain production practices and hired Tionghoa workers to work in the fields and the farmland.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took over the west and north coast of Taiwan and declared Taiwan to be the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Chinese-Japanese War (1894-1895), Qing's government signed the Shimonoseki Testament, which handed over its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists have a better picture of what their original appearance looks like.
In 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration continued to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which is the dominant film size at the end of the analog age.
Until today is produced, but more important is the aspect of the race that has been inherited by the digital camera sensor format.
It's actually 35 mm, it's a bit confusing, it's 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of the aspect of this format (from twelve to twelve to get the simplest round number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format groups) that are similar or approach this aspect.
The third most commonly violated and underestimated rule is a simple guide that creates both dynamism and keeping order in an image.
Note that the most effective place for the main subject is the meeting lines that separate the image into a vertical and horizontal third (see example).
During a historic period in Europe, the Catholic Church (which had become rich and powerful) was closely supervised.
For over a thousand years, Christian religion has united European countries despite different languages and traditions.
Its overwhelming power affects everything, from the king to the common people.
One principle of wealth must be used to deal with suffering and poverty, and the church’s monetary funds are available for this purpose.
The church's central authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this power and money rule has caused many to wonder if this teaching has been fulfilled.
As soon as the opposition broke, Britain began to block the German sea.
The strategy has proved effective, sending military and civilian supplies, although these blockades violate international laws that are generally accepted by some international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britannia installed a mine in international waters to prevent ships from entering the entire ocean, endangering neutral ships even though.
As a result of a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the infinity of the submarine battle.
In the 1920s, the attitude of most citizens and nations was passiveism and isolation.
After observing the horrors and horrors of World War I, many countries have set out to avoid the same situation in the near future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take up employment at Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents on his behalf, a book of poetry, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient Chinese has a unique way to show a different period of time; every stage in China or every powerful family is a different dynasty.
There is a stable time in each dynasty, and the most popular of these are the epics of the Three Kingdoms, which have lasted for 60 years between Han dynasty and Jin dynasty.
During this time, fierce warfare takes place among the nobles for the sake of the throne.
Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient Tiokok, thousands of people were killed fighting to sit in the highest chair in the high palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts like the use of metric systems, the shift from absolute government to republics, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not one ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, the opening of jobs for all male dressers, opens up a chance of success for the most ambitious.
The same applies to the military because instead of the rank of soldiers based on the class, they are now based on the calibaber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other hard-pressed workers from other countries to start their own revolution.
"He was very interested in things beyond this world's life, and he often visited caves that were later known as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Nur."
He locks himself up, who survives through time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirit tendency Muhammad.
At the top of one mountain in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from all over the world.
In fact, this place is not easy to find even when someone knows that this place exists.
Nothing can be seen but the sky and the mountains around it, and only a few can be seen or heard in this cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that are still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh of the world.
"Despite the Giza High, or "Nekropolis Giza" in the Valley of the Egyptian Dead had some pyramids (including the largest pyramid), some small tombs, some temples, and the largest Sphinx.
The huge pyramids were created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built to honor the wife and family members of Khufu.
"The sign of "bowur up" looks like the letter V and "the sign of bow down" like the steppes or square ones that don't have the bottom side."
Up means you should start from the end and push the bow, and down means you should start on the frag (which is the seat of your hand holding the bow) and pull the bow.
Tightening the top usually produces a softer sound, while the lower one is stronger and stronger.
Don't hesitate to write your own sign, but there's a reason for the music for the mark of the bow, so it usually has to be obeyed.
Fearing King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two little children (age 11 and the four-year-old Marie Therese and Louis-Charles) and King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mass of women marketers.
With the bus, they made their way back to Paris by surrounded by crowds of people shouting and calling for threats against the King and the Queen.
Mass crowds forced the king and the queen to open the windows of their train.
At one point, one of those hordes announced the head of government guards killed in Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
U.S. Imperial War shopping in conquering the Philippines is paid by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance most of the expenses and bonded flowers that floated on behalf of the Philippines government through the Wall Street banks.
The abundance of long - term exploitation against the people of the Philippines would certainly be a basic advantage for U.S. imperialism.
To understand Kenish, a man had to comprehend a context that would move him to create the order.
These events were held in the 11th century, the 12th century, and the 13th (1000€"1300M).
The Middle Ages summit began from the Middle Ages to the Middle Ages, which ended about 1500, based on the convention.
Technology determinism is a practical term that includes various ideas, from the drive of technology or the need for technology to the strict understanding that human destiny is driven by basic logic related to scientific law and the manifestation of technology.
"Most of the interpretations of technology determinism contain two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows the path that most transcends the influence of culture or politics, and that technology at last has the "effects" attached to society, not just social dissipation."
For example, a person can say that the car should lead to the development of highways.
However, the national highway network is not economically qualified for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The possession of mass cars also caused high numbers of road accidents, which were the beginnings of new techniques in the health world to repair a damaged body.
Romanticism has a quite large cultural determinism element, taken from such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and as time dawns, the custom and culture associated with that geography, and this, in line with the place of society, is better than the laws that are done by the authorities.
Just like Paris, known as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantine used to be considered the capital of feodal European fashion.
His fame as a center of luxury began from 400 to about 1100.
His state of affairs was in decline in the 12th century, especially because of the return of the Crusaders to bring in the prize of silk and spices that were worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
That was when the title of the City of Mode was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was deeply influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, as a result of slow communication, the western style may last 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the biggest developments at that time was the result of the Crusades, people started wearing cans to develop clothes.
Subsistence is a farm that is made to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence is a simple system, usually organic, and is used with the origin of the eco-region, which is combined with the rotational and other relatively simple techniques to maximize the harvest’s output.
Historically, most farmers are involved in farm swabs and this is still happening in many developing countries.
The subculture unites the same thinking individuals who feel ignored by the standards of society and allow them to develop their identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
A quality that determines a substructure that is different from others could be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuals, geography, or a combination of various factors.
Subculture members usually mark their membership through the use of a distinctive and symbolic style, including mode, temperament, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to describe the importance of socialization is to use some poor cases of children who, because of the development, accident, or deliberate harassment, are not socialized by adults when they grow up.
“Children like that are called “feral” or wild; some wild children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child’s burial is caused by parents’ rejection of intellectual or physical disorder of a child.”
Wild children may have suffered harassment or heavy trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are expected to be raised by animals; some say they have lived in their own wilderness.
When fully raised by nonmansian animals, wild children show almost as complete behavior as a particular animal that treats them, such as fear or disregard for humans.
When a project-based study should be made easier and more interesting, the pace of the study may take longer.
It is not a study method, but it is more helpful to support individuals who are undergoing new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A puzzle can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a puzzle shape but also with a small paper clip character at Microsoft Office.
Virtual puzzles are analyzed in software and are intended to question, push, and explain procedures that may be too great a challenge for students to solve themselves.
The children are placed in the hospital for various reasons, such as landscaping, harassment, and even extortion.
Children shouldn't grow up in an environment that doesn't care, cares, and grieves, but that's true.
We consider the Home Care System as a safe zone for these children.
Our care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and basic health care.
Caregiving should provide everything that was not in the house where they had been taken away.
The Internet undermines the elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Special internet features lead to additional dimensions in use and gratification approaches.
"Consequently, "learned" and "socialized" are recommended as an important motivation in Internet use (James dkk., 1995). "
"Personal involvement" and "remaining relationship" are also identified as a new aspect of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigate the audience's reaction to the website. "
The use of video recorders leads to an important discovery of micro-expression, facial motion, which occurs in milliseconds.
Specifically, it is stated that we can detect if someone lies by observing his micro expression correctly.
In his book The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how someone who doesn't understand the words of brain damage is still able to accurately assess the discretion.
He even suggested that the ability to interpret human behavior like that might have been possessed by animals like pets.
The 20th century research shows that there are two genetic variations: hidden and revealed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, while selection removes them from the expression group.
The segregation and recommendation divides the variation of the spin-off between two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with human-like discernment to meet the need for amino acid from available sources.
In addition, failure in doing so has a serious impact, namely depression growth, lack of nutrition, and finally death.
The most readily available source is the protein in leaves and nuts, but it's hard to digest for primates like us, unless it's cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (simultaneous, chirping, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also gives a high amount of protein that contains all the important amino acids.
"By considering all things, we should not be surprised when our ancestors deal with "protein problems" in a way that's almost similar to the chimpanzees in the wild right now."
Sleep disorder is the process you deliberately woke up during the normal sleep period, then fall asleep a few moments later (10"€"60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to make you awake without fully waking up.
If you restart the clock at bedtime, then the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, force you to stand up and turn it off.
Another option based on biorhythm involves taking a lot of fluids (including known water or tea, uretics) before retiring, forcing people to wake up and peep.
The amount of inner peace a person has in contrast with the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the power of life exists, the more people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment, the only thing that's blocking is our own negative tension and character.
Tibet's Buddhism uses the Buddha-teaching runway, but then expands it with a wealth of love and many techniques from Yoga India.
Basically, Tibet's Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the way of love for all.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini's energy (light energy) is risen through yoga posture, breathing training, mantra, and visualization.
Tibet's meditation center is the God of Yoga. Visualizing various energy source gods is cleared, the channels are activated, and the consciousness is created to shine.
Germany is a united enemy in the Second World War, resulting in the same work between the Soviet Union and the United States, with the end of the war and the conflict of the system, the process, and the culture that results in the collapse of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies are now enemies and the Cold War begins.
The war lasted for the next 40 years and would be fought in real terms, by proxies, on the African battlefields to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and elsewhere.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defense was broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reschedule throughout Romania's bridge.
However, this plan became obsolete last night, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union Red Army entered and created the Belarus and Ukraine guard after attacking the eastern Polish territory that violated the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Poland Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, both bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods so far is the most efficient way to move people and goods with a large number of ships across the sea.
The task of the Navy is traditionally to ensure that your country is able to maintain its ability in the movement of people and things, and at the same time, to hinder your enemy's ability in the movement of people and things.
One of the most important and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in PDII. America is trying to move troops and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help England.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mostly uses U-boats, has tried to prevent this jam.
If the Allies fail, Germany may conquer England as well as other European countries.
The goat appears to have begun being tamed some 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to tend goats so that they could easily obtain milk, fur, meat, and skin.
They tend to be used by children or adults, similar to the shepherd.
Wagonways was built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the train tracks are only parallel wooden boards, with this track the horse can pull the train so much tighter and attract more load than the road is a little rougher at the same time.
The draft was introduced from the beginning to hold the track in its place, but slowly realized that the track would be more efficient if it had an iron layer on its top.

Everyone is involved in society and using transport systems, most people are complaining about transport systems.
In the advanced country, you rarely hear the same level of complaint about the quality of water or the collapsed bridge.
Why did such complaints arise about the transportation system, why did their services always fail, or were transport engineers not competent, or were there any more basic things happening at this time?
The Rivers of the Cross is a study of the movement of drivers of traffic and vehicles between two points and the interactions they created each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is hard to do because driving behavior cannot be predicted with the level of certainty a hundred percent.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in consistent ranges; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and less mathematical representation.
In order to represent traffic flows better, the relationship between three main characteristics has been set: (1) course, (2) focus, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps with planning, planning, and operation of road facilities.
The insects are the first animals to explore the sky, the ability to fly helps them to avoid the enemy more easily and to find food and couples more efficient.

"In general, two behaviors can appear when the manager starts leading their former colleagues, one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "unless one of the people" (or women). "
Such a manager has difficulty making unusual decisions, doing disciplinary action, evaluating performance, establishing responsibilities, and demanding accountability.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone turns into an unknown individual, who feels he has to change everything the team has done and do it alone.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior is often a reflection of the division between the leadership and the team.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there is a little difference.
Virtual team members often act as contact points for their immediate physical group.

Blogs can also help improve the ability to write students, while students usually begin to feel the experience of making blogs with the language and spelling patterns, the presence of audiences generally changes that.
Since students are usually the most critical audiences, the bloggers are trying to improve the quality of writing to avoid criticism.
"In addition, the blog also "enforces students to get more involved about the world around them." The need to satisfy audiences inspire students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to expand their studies more than regular school.
