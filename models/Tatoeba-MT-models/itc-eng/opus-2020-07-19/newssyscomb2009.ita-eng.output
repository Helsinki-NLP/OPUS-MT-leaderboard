The triumph of the right populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakening of both existing parties in the great coalition and this marked reinforcement of the populist parties on the right have led, according to the first interim results, to the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), in which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the contrary, the Union's future leader for Austria (BZÖ), the sub-prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return to national policy.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the Socio-Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared with the last 2006 elections, however, lost 5.5%.
Even worse it went to ÖVP, which loses with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian history of the Postwar and above all the literally catastrophic result of the people, who have provoked early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in the preferences before SPÖ.
But the voters evidently punished them because they caused the government to sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignations of the party president, Vice-Chancellier Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it might happen on Monday when the Party's leadership is called out to be extraordinary.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely exit from the electoral result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both the liberal populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) have gained 18% in advance and the BZÖ 11% in advance - but the Social Democrats have at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999 when the populists agreed with the people to the collective government, (now the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 separated from the BZÖ) which was even the cause of sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national policy.
The Green Party, however, has also managed to enter Parliament, which has fallen slightly, falling from the third to the fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be solved by the Czech scientists who were accused of the illegal collection of scarabs in India, there would be, according to the Czech Foreign Minister, Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it had not been resolved, then it would have been a certain cooling," he said after the meeting which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly enter the legal affairs.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with that local in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," the Minister said.
According to Mukherjee, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, resort to a higher instance.
Then he can ask for bail and await the judgment in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends the appeal to the Supreme Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter the matter is to give the convicted the "competent legal support", the Indian Minister supported it.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been with India for many years.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as told ČTK, in front of its partner, stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider a profound error in the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question if he has obtained a promise from the Indian side to take care of it.
"I've got relatively many promises," he only found.
A Czech judge in the battle for seabeds
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are designed.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with her the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers on ocean and maritime rights issues.
His boss, Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exposure and every time he adds something.
The desire to work and enthusiasm dominates.
The seabed still hides now a world little known rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also unknown living organisms so far that bring within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest ground floor on the mainland
The coastal states have begun to take an interest in the underwater territory.
According to the OSN Convention, the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica have been adopted.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental platform, which often extends to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, it has an exclusive right over all resources of the continental platform.
"A few words per continental platform means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles," Mikulka explains.
The country's request before the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very broad technical-scientific documentation based on many investigations and costly measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia’s recent success, which has greatly expanded its marine properties, has recorded a global echo.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to you by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers, so about six times the same state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bear them in the future from the seabed, as they promise, will be invaluable.
Other states will gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental platform ends begins the area of the bottom of the ocean that the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity."
No one has ever been in an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Fundal isn't Klondike," says the director Mikulka, "with the fact that his individual parties are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If he shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pierinary investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the extended Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and a little bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is fractured, this is a nearly underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a land rich in polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker in the Division of Macedonia Rober Sandev brings with him a repertoire to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the wake of Golem.
Special German units were present at the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government had called for help from Germany for the release of the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is available on the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages seized.
On the rescue operation, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior participated in special German units.
In addition to the Army specialists, the GSG9 units, the avian federal police, the federal criminal office, as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present on the spot.
As the spokesman of the ministries reported on Monday evenings, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, have released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get lucky," says an inside ministry spokesman.
Aggressors kidnapped on September 19 in southern Egypt a group of travelers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end was kept secret as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
The libertarians in the meantime arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
It did not explain the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin, by the time they were back in Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and the special units should fly with an Airbus of the military aeronautics and arrive in Germany Tuesday.
American Chamber of Representation rejects the rescue package.
The first room of the American Congress just failed the 700 billion dollar rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 items around 227, the US representative house rejected the government rescue package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of American President George W. Bush and top-level politicians of both parties, there had been no majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been tackled.
In a dramatic action the supporters desperately tried to persuade the critics from the heavy package of 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, encouraged Members to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something that has not yet arrived..
While the suffrage was in progress, the Dow Jones collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for the investor's concerns was that the state rescue package could have failed.
Before the end of the vote then, after the announcement of failure, it will collapse again.
Experts now expect other serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it must have the benefit of both the House of Members and the Senate.
Promoters register figures increasing bookings
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study, the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite the weak sights of conjuncture, the desire to travel Germans under an investigation remains strong.
On bookings for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a 31 % turnover plus the same period of the previous year , as the German Tourism Association DRV announced in Berlin on Monday .
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute there are increased booking rates also for the autumn months.
Therefore, the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would amount to about 11%, the DVR reported.
As expected for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the whole market.
It would also include travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
As a result of the low dollar quota, which was requested in particular for travel in the United States, the DVR reported.
Here the increase in reservations would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly sought from the Germans Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as from within Germany.
Especially the travels all included have a high quote, explained the president of DRV Klaus Laepple.
Considering the increasing costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be better "calculated for customers than for an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the previous year there would again be an excess of the turnover - even though according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Hits of Ballermann, mouth beer from a liter and vip in Dirndln griffates.
A Wiesn debut
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a tailored Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, is that just 3 minutes to Wiesn, the photographers are already shooting at us and taking pictures to fill the memory of the cameras – very lusinghiero, and this is my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends do it
The two-money Dirndl seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of the Wiesn and actually resident north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/wear so far remains in the limits.
And instead, once you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's trimming collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A monk lets me note that I would have laced it in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, at the center six virgins, on the right you are engaged, behind widow."
I'm sobbing my bow from behind to the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of thin flirting techniques and wear over hats of felt, on which cape "To drop to get dressed!" and squeeze the inside naked against an uninvited one.
The boy with showy inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and he also visits Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a torn "oooooo".
That tells me, after he got rid of his beer mouth from a litre before he drank.
Right next to one of these moisturizers, of which everyone thinks he's a pattoiser.
Bob is one of these famous "Wildbiesler".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8:00 p.m., they walk white on the party square, the health professionals who need to take care of the poor beons
Nurses show up in white every time – always 4 at a time drag a tent-covered barrel in the tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: you go empty, you come back full.
Anyone lying under the curtain in this blood-alcoholic pot, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," screams one of the toilets and disappears in the baraund.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being invested in a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Shenfield Road accident in the city on Friday afternoon.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly afterwards.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with an abusive driving charge.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is widening the diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish interland.
On the eastern part of the forest, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building is riding between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire slightly decadent building.
But once inside the office ticket from ceiling to ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most west pass.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railroad running in Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is today Saudi Arabia.
But the imperial ambitions of Germany sank during the first world war.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for the Hyderpasha station, too.
In 1917 an ammunition train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then he has slowly gone missing, largely overcome by history.
But today, this rail outlet for Anathalia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's increasingly larger diplomatic horizons.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
There is now a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the car bed for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish deputy Suat Kinikioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a race to bouncing along the tracks that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn its backs to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic root represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the general district of AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a suburb in the way of development, surrounded by medium commercial centers and power pastries, where managers in business - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a middle-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its nearest neighbours.
Cold war was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its interior.
Today you must look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with each other.
They must be both.
"But surely at a certain point, "I ask, "Will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "does not want to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost everyone I've talked to here has recited in memory: the links of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as much as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically travel those railways to the east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha Station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentleman Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that the Middle East ambitions of Europe can now be largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I stand at the terminal for the ferry that brings me back through the forest, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At the same time, there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should advance its claim on this fascinating country.
Remember Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11th) had in charge of Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21, but at the time the Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty years old - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to face everything that the music presented to do, both madrigali and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the entire orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "leave music to speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the stick was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowering.
Whatever the musical standard was, it was getting more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to name an orchestra director, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades when he drove Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the last 40 years and over I have been dealing with more than 100 of his concerts and can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated the orchestra directors who, in his words, simply "carried around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your William Woodruff necrology (September 25th) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... at the same time studying for a degree in science, one in letters and one PhD".
This follows from the note by Woodruff author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at that time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vita", because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda Supersolds
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider inner space.
A refined mechanic, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel, should be added to everything.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Jazz Honda.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz features a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth pointing out an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before going to analyze the new model, it is helpful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other producers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case with Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Just in Japan, almost a million units of Jazz have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will make it possible to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation is concerned, Spanish subsidiaries expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units over a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the sales decrease in Spain to a good extent.
In fact, the managers of the company plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 less than in 2007, with a 16% drop.
Despite the increase in sales the Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company's presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz grew in all its parts.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the interaction is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, also expands the living space.
This advantage derives from the insertion of a new platform, and from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the luggage - equipped with double background - rises to 399 litres, that is, 19 litres more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the engine version 1.4 measurements, and that the luggage capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - affect an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, are opened with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, motors in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the moment of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with 1,2 and 1.4 liter petrol engine.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to use a power of 90 cv to 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm to 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, are now available 100.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses achieves a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "ape car" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese society has created a robot that, for example, by taking the flight of bees, is able to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Two, Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the Safety Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the producing house.
During the flight, each water creates its own personal oval-shaped space that is very similar to Nissan's safety shield.
But the most important thing is the eyes composed of bees, able to see in all directions with a angle above 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, engineers have developed what has been defined as a locator laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C for a radius within two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board that immediately allows to prevent collision.
"At the moment that he detects an obstacle, the small robot imitates the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction turning on the wheels at right or higher angles to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and Chief Engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot divert upwards or downwards, or even diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can turn its wheels and not exploit infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act based on this data.
It does not require the storage of information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozen KBs of memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, and not even mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to destination by avoiding obstacles in the path.
Trema before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the United States Treasury Department, as well as having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from getting engaged in misdemeanours in dubious insolvency banks, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Bad Credits Hotel" ... or problems.
The tetro aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to induce thinking not one, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, above all, where to do so, which is probably the primary objective.
Of course the information the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It is more a page for adolescents than a site for the wide audience.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a sleeproom inside the hotel.
It's still something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest $9 billion in a share of 21% of participation in the Company, news received following a net downturn in its stock exchange.
One week after the draft of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would have bought 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The price established is less than 19% lower than the book value of securities as at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley specified that the overall transaction would be carried out on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars, or a percentage less than its current course of 28%.
By 1700, however, Morgan Stanley had fallen from 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," explained John Mack, director-general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow them to differentiate his actions, however, by passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious approach than previously.
The methods defined on Monday also show that in recent days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had just announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese colossus for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought our share would be exclusively composed of ordinary actions.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, the MUFG will get the Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their 7% accounting value.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert half its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if, over a given period, the latter will be exchanged more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by the MUFG would allow it to take up investment opportunities, strengthen its budget and increase its liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group, however, refused to provide clarification regarding the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency coefficient of approximately 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has specified that she has "clearly" lightened her budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have tested the group, which has seen half the value of its shares while the cost of insurance against risks has been met.
However, it remained at a high level on Monday, around 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, the only other "superstitious" among the large Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's detection, announced that they had earned $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Founding the republic about socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, the latter gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission carried out since, according to the official results, 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on an 80% basis.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while the 7% of the votes were zero and the 0.7% were white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the election seats and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a crushing victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his Constitution project.
"The Constitution triumphed gloriously," he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians in the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did their Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points aimed at consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrines the state's power over the economy, giving it the "development planning" of a country that essentially lives from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives greater power to the Head of State, who may be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced the intention of exploiting this amendment and re-appointing its candidacy for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states that health and education services are free of charge, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commander launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts who were kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held prisoners in the desert for ten days were reported on Monday afternoon, healthy and saved, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Chad by an Egyptian commander.
Apparently in form, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base, near Cairo International Airport, around 15 and 30, on a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to issue any press interviews, to Maadi hospital, a Cairo residential periphery, for analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and have not been paid any ransom "to the kidnappers", said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana on the landing track.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been hopped from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Egypt, the organizing agency of the safari.
One Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, shortly before dawn.
"There were shots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others got away," said the responsible who asked to keep the anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commanders.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of the secret agents and special Italian forces.
We must admit that if we have achieved this result it has been thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding more details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to intercept a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were on board and six were killed, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and two were captured.
According to the army the kidnappers would be linked to an organization of rebels in Darfur, the movement for the Liberation of Sudan, (SLA_U), claim immediately denied by the latter.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the first page, a debate on the financing of the culture on which the current electoral campaign is focused.
That's better.
But a part of our cultural life remains in the shadow.
Who will decide to denounce the poor amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or to national historical places that make hunger?
Which policy will dare to remind the federal government that is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have any real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the only restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
At our neighbours, it is the Constitution to say that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies to safeguard historical, genealogical heritage, archives and heritage assets, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are the ones who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch Fortis bank, which was first in trouble in Europe for the crisis in the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands at the weekend agreed at the highest level, also involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this area can be a precedent.
According to the decision taken Sunday night all three states will stop almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of Fortis had started with a vertical collapse, serious signs of the institute's crisis had appeared in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow them to go bankrupt.
Bank shares fell by almost 12%, the lowest point for 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Given the current share prices, the group's entire capital value is around EUR 14 billion, but according to bank managers this value is not real.
The company's summit is responsible for the collapse of Fortis actions to the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the US plan's acceptance of 700 billion dollars.
Monday the title slowly rose again.
Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new managing director of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented itself with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors should not be afraid of losing money.
Among the customers of the bank there was no panic, the subsidiaries were not assaulted.
In Hungary the Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurers, on the basis of people's medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market becomes uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken to the fox" - writes Washington Post citing Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies shall be subject to the insurance rate and the amount in the event of loss to the health status of the client and if they consider that the risk is too high, they shall not conclude the insurance.
The customer had to undergo a medical visit some time ago and the contract was concluded only after the examination was completed.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer's identification code you can easily have information from the pharmacies on which he purchased in the last year and a half and from this the evidence program of which diseases and in what health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that the level of fat in the blood is in practice unreguariably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
In trade there are several versions of the programme, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer beyond the paper work does not remain very much, even if there are small difficulties.
Among other things, some medicines can be used for more purposes, e.g. some compounds can be used against migraine or heat vams, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, is true as a risk-increase factor, the first two nos.
For the request and processing of data, a separate company was formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, requested the patient's approval.
The authorities now oblige them to do so even if so far they have not inflicted much on the negligence.
Some companies have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to medical consumption data to provide a more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data and parallel use control will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a proposal for a law that gives control authorities control powers to companies specialized in the service of data.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that connects the other data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot deny approval so much because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So in the end the hens are entrusted with the fat of the fox.
Global Marseille menu
European Union and India double trade
Given that the European Union and India are partners that trade mainly with each other, also the agenda of the ninth meeting at the summit has been dominated by this issue, as well as all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will deal first of all with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to decide whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue in the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Committee and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in five years, that is to say to increase up to EUR 100 billion, trade.
Whereas between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also take the lead in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth place among EU partners.
The summit devoted attention to global events.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the commercial Doha Round, although both sides played a role in the failure to do so.
The EU has confirmed that it continues in the energy and climate programme, that is, it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as on the fact that it would have to conclude a global agreement at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce by 50% by 2050 the production of greenhouse gas.
They also want to stop the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India today will be in the French capital, where in a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris it is hoped that in order to build the Indian nuclear reactors, French firms will receive a sale worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian editors at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
There will be more than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international appointment for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry for the Goods and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will follow the meeting with the press at the Room Struktur in Buchmesse's 5.0 Pavilion: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author books is progressively reduced on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and young people.
Returned Steve Fossett's plane the missing billionaire a year ago
The relic of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying into the Nevada desert.
The routes were found on an altitude of 3000 metres, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, escaped the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains have been found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63 years old, was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the sighting of the relic a team of investigators was sent, which then identified the device: it is exactly Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed from 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett had been discovered by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a hat.
Fossett's research had been discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic ball: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later he'd been flying around the world without a stopover.
Among his many records, including that he flew at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A Suv out of schematics with an original design and well defined by defined lines, large surfaces and net corners.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" offroads of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a fresh start in this sector.
For its content outside the traditional canons, it will be unexpected and unconventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the showroom Mercedes-Benz from next October 17.
Thus the advertising batting that will accompany the debut of the new car will launch an unpublished mode of communication also through an adventurous campaign of 3D affiliations, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-affisions, articulated in three different stages, will dominate the very central route of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como you will be able to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, by looking at the image you will have the impression that the car is coming out of the manifesto.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped field of motor communication.
Will this formula be able to sharpen the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans
Of the Trivenetus, they risk Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls whose whole Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following for years the National Blue and that until now, for the truth, has never created too many problems.
Not even if he was at odds with the typos opponents.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste is Udine.
To these in Sofia there were added groups (small units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the cities of origin of the militants appear: Saturday night they were removed to be unidentified.
They're inspired by the English typhoon.
In Bulgaria they found a true Nazi typhoon, that of the Levski.
Figc had made available the Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all names, so easily controlled.
And the Viminal had checked them all: among those who left Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited by attending a stadium.
In fact, four blue fans, who had prior to stadium crimes, had been refused the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminal expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and will take action: in this case, you can give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the disturbances.
An international Daspo that prevents the attendance not only of Italian stadiums but of all Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, they're not gonna put any more foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now there is fear-emotion: that to those a little more than one hundred and fifty, they add others.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize those who behave this way," they support Viminale.
So, "look well open especially in view of the National game of Wednesday in Lecce."
In Puglia there is a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, i.e. secret services, which takes care of the stadium problems.
"The Duke-Duce choirs and the arm weaved during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime..."
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Observatory of Viminale (he took the place that was before Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazelli had previously been the star of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not wrong to deny the Duke but surely the behavior of those 150-200 typhoons has been shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - it adds the n.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact happens.
So far this group has remained in line, now we will see what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the fischi all'inno of Mameli: even those I'm not a criminal, but if you allow me, I'm not an education...".
