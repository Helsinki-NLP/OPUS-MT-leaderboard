Former head of Brazilian presidential office is brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential office for assuming his involvement in a massive corruption scheme concerning the Petrobras state oil company.
The federal prosecutor's office stated that Jose Dirceu will be sued for the charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Fourteen other people will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, former Treasurer of the Workers' Party, in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, former president of business services in Petrobras.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the Workers' Party in government in custody for links with this scheme.
Dirceu served as chief of staff of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August of his home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting scheme in Congress more than 10 years ago.
The prosecutors said that Dirceu developed the Petrobras Mitta Mitage Scheme, accepted bribes while he was in office and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the vote scandal purchased.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved about $2 billion in the form of bribes and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also have included bribes to the Petrobras director in exchange forflated contracts.
The "miracle" recovery of a Peshawar massacre survivor
A paralysed teenager who had been shot four times in Pakistan’s most brutal terrorist attack managed a “miracle” recovery after treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, the Pakistani doctors had told him that he would never be able to go.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be released later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, on a regular Tuesday morning, Mohamed was sitting at first aid time and listening carefully to his teachers.
Even then, seven armed men dressed in security uniforms entered the army's public school.
They carried belts with explosives and had to carry out a simple mission: to kill all the men, women and children in their way.
“I can’t forget what happened that day,” Mohamed says with a rough look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... then I heard gunshots outside.
The terrorists went inside and started killing.
Mohamed describes how he took four students out of the amphitheater while the carnagi was taking place.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, screaming him.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he in the head.
Most of the people killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he fainted and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the waist down.
The doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then the doctors in Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and he would never be able to go.
“When I saw him, I felt my soul coming out,” says Sher Khan, Mohamed’s father.
Those nine months were the hardest in my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionate about cricket would never be able to use his feet again.
They did a campaign and asked for help from Pakistani television, attracting support from famous people like Imran Khan, who became a politician.
In the end, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and give him treatment at the Harley Street private clinic in London.
The consultant's neurosurgeon Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "fearful" when he reached the hospital.
“He had spent the last [some] months lying in bed, without being able to move from one side to another, says Malik.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in too good shape.
A vertebrae from the base of Mohamed's vertebrae column had been destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in his shoulder, hip and back during the attack, and the lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during a six-hour operation, Malik and his team managed to rewire the nerve endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised at what happened next.
Just a week after the operation, Mohamed got up and started taking steps and going.
We didn't expect such a good outcome.
It was a miracle," he says.
In less than two weeks after the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged fate and began to go again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But he is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"It's like I still have a chance to live," he says, showing the pictures with weapons drawn by him next to school textbooks and pens
Physically, Mohamed becomes increasingly powerful every day, but psychological trauma through which he goes and now is unimaginable.
"My anger has not fallen," he confesses.
In my school, little kids were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes a tear, comforts the growing one, and says: “I see my son walking again.”
He'll be able to continue to be alive.
The "Super Voice" 4G Service at Three offers better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
Three mobile phone provider launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve reception within buildings and in rural areas without signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
Other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long Term Evolution (Voltte)".
It only works for the moment with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the next months.
Three notes that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to the service by 2017.
Head of Technology, Bryn Jones said: “By the end of the year, one million of our customers will have access to better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than so far.”
Vedettes are prepared for the pantomime stage
The pantomime stage is very important for theaters throughout the United Kingdom, many of which are preparing for this year's internship.
Now, at the Christmas Theatre, some of the biggest names in the showbusiness are participating.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Cinderella - first in the role of one of the evil sisters, and second in the role of fairy.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: “If I don’t do anything, I feel guilty.”
Steven Wilson was recently designated the great winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has often been called the most creative musician in the world of progressive rock.
The musical talent won three prizes at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In its five-star review, The Guardian called the album "an intelligent, expressive and captivating work of art."
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of many music projects, the best known being the rock band Porcupine Tree.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activity.
He told BBC about his love for vinyl and his loaded program and explained how comedy actor Matt Berry got to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up even in the end of the vinyl era, and I remember that at that time I was just waiting for the CD to appear, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You were buying a record, going with him home, having a scratch and you had to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example the classic one, they're better than vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing else you really value.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice painting hanging in the living room.
It's something you can hold in hand, while you get absorbed by the lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but there's no way that if a kid too young to remember the vinyls they like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl you especially hold in?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyl in the '90s.
All the wines I've got are bought again.
I started with the idea of restoring the collection I was 15 years old, but I'm past that limit.
The first record I got my parents to buy was Out of the Blue from Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately it is somewhere through a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a gateway to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transience compilation on vinyl?
It was originally designed as an idea for the record day, but I missed the opportunity.
My home suggested to gather a few of my shorter and more accessible songs.
I became easily obsessed with the idea of doing something like "introducing into Steven Wilson's music" and I had necessarily kept the project to be launched only on vinyl.
Who buys vinyl also receives a download version at high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in its real light?
No, because, although I focus on longer music, there's one thing I've always valued above anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses more on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, has passed the time test because they have always put the emphasis on the melodic side and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for Albert Hall shows?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different every night.
In the first, it will be a version of Hand's show. Erase. which we had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night will be rather an incursion into my history, it being more oriented towards the fans who followed me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And me and the rest of the tour team are big fans of [the comedy series on Channel 4] Toast of London, to the point where we always get quoted from it.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, too, so I bought him his album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and I asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
Looks like I'm extremely lucky to have him in the opening.
You remixed albums of some bands like XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does that affect your own music?
I'm not consciously inspired by this, but, inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they remain in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was without a doubt the most progressive old school album I ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the year before.
The current album, Hand Erase, is much more open, because we were working at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You're often described as the busiest progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can delete the word progressive.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I'm not saying that with pride, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited that from my father, who has an ethic of incredibly powerful work.
If I don't do anything for a whole day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why remix work was a gift, because it means I don't have to do all the time just my music.
The music industry is a tough place to do your career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy I don't think I would have survived.
Transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on September 25.
Steven Wilson will play at the Royal Albert Hall on September 28 and 29, as part of his 2015-2016 European tournament.
A new contract brings jobs back to Skytrans
New Skytrans re-engaged some of the airline staff who lost their job when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, the restored company from northern Queensland, has helped a 25 million-dollar contract to transport the employees of the natural gas company QGC, which meant that 18 crew members got their job back.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidised routes that formed a large part of the airline's business.
The bankruptcy led many communities to face a potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, the national-liberal federal parliament for Northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the critics of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, executive director of Skytrans, said that the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We managed to reassess 18 Skytrans staff members with a full schedule, as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC clients.
In just five months, we increased with 100% work force, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims to extend Skytrans’s flight operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which serves as Head of York and Strait of Torres, and also to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 round-the-clock flights for QGC staff and Brisbane entrepreneurs to Chinchilla and Taroom locations in its 36-place Dash-8 aircraft, starting on Monday, 26 October.
Tony Nunan, CEO of QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following an auction procedure.
“We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland, ” he said.
Skytrans contract maintains its high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
The Liberal and New Mother's Parliamentary Kelly O'Dwyer is advised to make a larger supply of milk to avoid voting in the Chamber
Looks like more women will be in the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be put on Monday and there are strong signals that more women will occupy the portfolios.
One of the government's rising stars, Kelly O'Dwyer, has been advised to make a greater supply of milk for her newborn to avoid breast-feeding to intervene in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government's disciplinary officer, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his Labour counterpart to find out what is the most appropriate approach for a breast-feeding parliament, in accordance with the orders in force.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer and her daughter Olivia.
Under the orders in force - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - the mothers who breast-feeding get a voting power in Parliament.
That means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exemption before he consulted the opposition's disciplinary officer, Chris Hayes, in this matter.
Things rushed on two occasions, when O'Dwyer could not attend a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to hold a speech because he had just begun breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the parliament was going to make a bigger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, Queensland Parliamentary, is responsible for government discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
They both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources of Buchholz and O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media that the Higgins division representative was furious when he was told to make a bigger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This is revealed even when the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull works at his new cabinet.
Buchholz, the Liberal National Parliamentary of Queensland, was promoted as responsible for the discipline by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the censor motion test of February of this year.
O'Dwyer, alongside Amanda Rishworth of Labour Party and her son Percy, is one of the three women in Parliament.
Former Head of Discipline, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a motion of censure by which he wanted to be removed from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Liberal Andrew Nickolic of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed as Deputy Head of Discipline.
Nickolik had recently held the front page of the papers, after it was discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to refuse to challenge Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter, Olivia, was born in May.
He's one of the three MPs who became a lady this year.
The spokesman for the Labour Party, Catherine King, said Wednesday that the voting power for nursing mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"She is now [seven years old]," she wrote on Twitter.
The responsible with discipline should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said Wednesday that he wants more women in his office.
"No one wants more women than me to see more women in power, influence, in Parliament, in ministry, in all the country," the Prime Minister said in front of reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included a single woman in his first cabinet and, after pressure to increase the representation of women in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the re-establishment of December.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull could have on Australia's business sector.
Tuesday, lobby groups in the business sector did not know how to manifest their enthusiasm more strongly when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's friars as prime minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see had been abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or he simply ended up in a negotiated suspension because of Abbott's political "crash-or-crash-through".
The representatives of the interest groups spoke unanimously about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy public interest, reach a political agreement and do things well.
So what exactly does the country's biggest companies and their representatives expect from our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising.
Turnbull himself set as the starting target of the free trade agreement with China.
In his first speech announcing on the media that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChAFTA) represented the central point of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticized "the revolt of economic shock" by the Labour Party on that issue and expressed concern about the racist temptation of critics.
“In the context of ChAFTA, winners are numerically much more than losers,” he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes that he will win this debate.
Don Argus, the legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wishes to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity and negotiate with the whole senate.
The Minister for Small Business, Bruce Billson, supports the Harper Analysis recommendations.
This could lead to some divergences with the business environment from the beginning.
The impact assessment shall apply to large mergers and other contracts in order to decide whether consumers will have to suffer because of the lack of competition.
It is called "effect assessment" because it takes into account not only the company's actions and intentions but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this assessment is drawn up is extremely important for the outcome.
Harper's competition law analysis recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to get away from smaller operators on the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was by the Australian Business Council and major retail traders.
Turnbull now understands that he wants the whole cabinet to think about what he'll do next.
The CAA jumped to say that if Turnbull followed Harper's recommendations, consumers would have to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one who advised the new prime minister to have greater respect for the processes in the cabinet, which Turnbull seems to do by making it leave Bruce Billson, the minister for small businesses (which is on the side of Harper recommendations) to support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers followed women between sixty and eighty years of age.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have reduced their "significant" probability of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplication table under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard thinks I've completely misunderstood arithmetic.
The negative character of the Empire said for Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think one time is equal to one.
"How to be equal to one?" he said.
If one or two do one, it means two has no value, since one or itself has no effect.
One makes two, because the fourth root is two, so what is the second root of the two?
It should be one, but we're told it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's teachers disagreed with his theory, so he gave up at Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"You can't just close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics called "Terryology".
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassessing scissors, wire, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his theory "one time" and other similar theories of his.
He said for the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, were spending up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The Rolling Stone editor described Howard's creations as "rubbers with infinitely more complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes, linked to them with copper wire or caught with magnets."
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the American patent 20150079872 A1 ("Building brick systems and methods").
Also, the actor from "After the footsteps of an idol" further says that Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would "make it crazy" if they saw Terryology.
"You know," he says, "I've been asking since I was three-four years old why does a bubble form round?"
Why don't you become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard also added that he hopes to change the whole course of education.
“This will be the last century our children will learn that one time they do one,” he said.
They won't have to grow in ignorance.
In twenty years now, they'll know that one time one does two.
We are about to reveal a new truth.
True universal mathematics.
We'll check in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Printing
Tuesday, during the “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon”, Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, interpreting "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying her vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Weeknd.
This week, Grande's name has been in the press.
On the same day, she was also in "Good Morning America", where she opened the show with the Gogoat Line incident.
Taco Bell hopes that the "Cantina" restaurants where you will serve will become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On 22 September, the Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain will open a new location in the Chicago Wicker Park area, offering a menu of snack tapas, a fresco painted by a local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first test location of the “Taco Bell Cantina” restaurants of the chain, which addresses young people, concentrated in increasing numbers in the city centers.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6000 restaurants in the USA, has its roots mainly in suburbs and is associated with cheap food, prepared quickly, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average Taco Bell payment rating of 7 USD, the company used drive-through service and quick services to attract the number of customers needed to make profit.
But Taco Bell says that in order to address the new generation that "looks for more central urban environments in which to live, work and have fun", the test locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
So you can do a drive-through, you need some land.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"You're not allowed," he said to USA TODAY Neil Borkan, the Francoist Taco Bell who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared alongside traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you can see the food on your own" before it is ready, said the Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Also, wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will be served at the new location, following the recent example of many Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer "nightly" menus that include beer, wine and snacks.
A thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company stated that another location Taco Bell Cantina will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing drive-through service and parking with an inner courtyard and a sales window.
These location changes, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the fast food chain of restaurants also wants to attract other types of customers outside those who are looking for fast food food late at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when he opened more expensive Cantina and burritos menus to compete with Chipotle, the project being supported through an advertising campaign focused on the content of new preparations proteins.
If they succeed, Cantina restaurants will be another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said that until 2022, he plans to open 2000 restaurants in the United States.
As Sandland said for AP, "a few hundred" of these will be like "Cantina".
They set up their calls in the middle of the night: Elton John is making Putin's court.
Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned Elton John on Monday night only a few days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss the ancient Russian legislation together.
The British homosexual song, declared, attempted without success to get an interview with Putin while in Russia, in November 2014, one year after challenging the protests in this country and sustained two concerts in 2013, during a turbulent period in the history of this state, following the adoption of controversial laws, which prohibit "gay propaganda" in the children's ranks.
In 2014, in Sankt Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made the following statement to the fans: "Although I'm gay, I always felt welcome here in Russia."
If I wouldn't be honest about what I am, I couldn't compose these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for such things, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist devalued that she wanted to meet Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
Until now, there is no clear information on the telephone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos has "singed" all in ANRP file
The business man Dorin Cocos tries to save himself from a burning conviction, "sing" in front of the judges and detailing how he distributed millions of euros to the former members of the ANRP Commission.
Audited yesterday at the Court of Cassation and Justice in the file in which he is tried with the son or Alin Cocos, the former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Disparations of the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was hit by the lightning of sincerity.
He recognized all the charges and told the judges how he helped the businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of the compensations at ANRP, instead seeking to be judged more quickly and to keep an account of his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos showed that he knew Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he was implicated with him after more real estate business.
He said Sergiu Diacomatu met in 2010, and he told him to work at ANRP.
Later we found out that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is vice president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised him the money, 2.5 million euros, the money I told him I'd give him in more installments.
I also promised him political support, to remain in office.
"Diacomatou then told me to help, but he needs support," said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.
He also said that he later, through an acquaintance, came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Disapearance Commission, who promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, I gave him five million euros.
The Dumitrean crinutes are a million euros, Dragos Bogdan gave him 800,000 euros.
I mean, I'm just saying that all this money was in her trance, to make sure that the file was done.
"That's how I told them, to solve the file, to pay off," Cocos said.
Asked why he got to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I got eight million euros for the second file to solve the problem, but I only got 1.2 million euros left.
In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.
"I never talked to this money or land," Cocos said.
He also pointed out that "it was notoriety that all members of the ANRP understood before the meeting."
I didn't have any emotions that they wouldn't vote positive.
All functions were political in ANRP, but I personally did not help Diacomatu politics.
"I told him I only helped him politically to calm him down," Cocos concluded his statement.
Bridge brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Premier Victor Ponta was at DNA yesterday, for only five minutes, while he filed new documents in the file "Turkey - Rovinari".
Victor Ponta ran away to DNA with a document of the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the side of the file in which he is researched for false inscriptions under private signature, complicit at tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went from his own initiative to DNA, although the documents they could have been sent by counsel.
It wasn't like that, because the prosecutor didn't have time, the prime minister leaving after five minutes, while he left for the recording more documents.
I wanted to file (at the file, n.r.) the decision of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what happens to service contracts.
I say we've been active, the prosecutor says we haven't, the European Court of Justice has told us to see each other's work, because, as long as the taxes have been paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is binding, surely, for all the countries of the European Union, we do not have a case here," Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on the release of DNA.
The Ponta also said that the decision of the European Court should apply, whether we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call it back to hearing, but to also give him an answer to his requests, including passing the file.
Johnis enjoying his term without a TV
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch TV.
And you don't even own such a device, since you pay your TV fee once with your energy bill.
But if you're the head of the state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is understood that the position of the Romanian President is also part of the relationship to everyday realities.
President Iohannis is immersed every day in a total quiet in the office or from Cotrocenes
Only, to the astonishment of his closest people at the Cotrocene Palace, Klaus Iohannis refused to have television in his presidential office.
And after he doesn't look at TV - on any program, at least at TTL or Pro Sieben's non-Trade stations - the president doesn't listen to radio stations and doesn't read newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or demand a priority.
Instead, Iohannis is happy to receive only the report with the news that puts him in a positive light.
And in addition to this informational self-isolation, in which the only breach is the access to the facebook, much more serious is the blockage to which, through its passiveness, the head of the state imposes the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, even though it's been so long since its installation in office, Johnnis hasn't yet signed the declarations of loyalty of more than half of the employees of the Presidential Administration.
Which becomes an increasingly serious problem, both humanly and legally.
Peace and quiet
Those in the presidential entourage are already clear that no one and nothing can ever hurt "feng shui" from the head of state's office.
Where is peace and quiet.
What's right, only after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when the former Sibi's building demands the presence of officials.
A custom that probably didn't get out of time when he was driving the city's primary on Cibin.
And the fact that Iohannis does not want television in the office has already been born countless legends, being people from the Cotrocene Palace who have become inclined to the variant that the president would try to avoid its monitoring.
Especially since he doesn't have any radios.
Only at this rate will it be able to meditate as quickly in the dark, because the lighting devices can hide the audio-video recording technique.
Just fine.
Also, another peculiarity of the Cotrocene Palace is the delivery to the head of the state only of the "pzoitive monitoring" of the president's activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the chief of state will get its contents on the biorus.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that it was prohibited to "negative monitoring" in conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a result of the night broadcasts on television in which he was criticised, but was asking every morning, with priority, for negative news.
That doesn't mean you were a guest who helped him out of something, but that's what the gesture counts!
And at least he can never have the excuse that he was not well informed of alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed
Now, after all, you love her and the mystery why she doesn't want to watch Klaus Johnnis on TV.
Until then, more important would be to solve, regardless of the formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees from the Presidential Administration.
Who, to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a statement of loyalty to the head of the state in office and who must bear and sign it.
Only since December and until now, Klaus Iohannis has not signed for confirmation at least half of these statements, although this was to happen within 30 days.
So hundreds of employees, representing over half the staff at the Cotrocene Palace, now have an uncertain situation.
Because, legally speaking, if the chief of state doesn't personally sign their statement, they should get kicked out.
Only they didn't get the negative opinion!
So, I mean, I can come whenever the Court of Auditors inspectors, who will find that, over half a year, so many hundreds of people have received their salaries at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
That's until he decides and the president if he gets out or confirms them on his own, his decision being strictly his.
Authorities said that a teenager was launching an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S.
A teenager's inspired plan to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. was rather “in terms of aspiration” than operational, confirmed on Tuesday a police source for Fox News.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in Philadelphia in August when the law enforcement authorities broke the plan.
The plan is the same as the Texas Representative, Mike McCaul, the President of Homeland Security, during an interview given on Sunday, told a source for Fox News.
"We monitor very carefully the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul said at ABC's "This Week."
Pope Francisc was not mentioned as the specific target of the plan in a newsletter.
Joint information by the FBI and the Department for Internal Security of August 14, in which the teenager was said to be planning to use more attacks, firearms and explosives, with the target “a foreign dignity during a high-level event”.
The bulletin mentions that the minor has radicalized through social networks.
The adolescent may suffer from a mental illness, said a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving accurate details about the young person's illness.
Also on Sunday, McCaul acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called "single wolf" across the whole nation and noted that he was informed by the Secret Services about a "secret location" for the Pope's visit.
And with that comes a great security risk...So, as the time draws near, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.

The skeleton dating from the medieval period discovered in the tree has suffered a violent death, I tell experts
Irish archaeologists have revealed amazing details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of an old 215-year-old tree.
Collooney's beech, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, lighting the macabre view of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish National Monument Service has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to dig and analyze the remains, thus discovering a fascinating story.
"He was killed violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services for FoxNews.com.
On the top of his chest he has wounds caused by the knife. He has such a trace in his left hand, which suggests that he was trying to defend himself.
The skeleton is of a young man between 17 and 20 years of age.
The radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
“We can’t know if he was killed in battle or in a personal quarrel,” says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after the Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
“It was probably buried by family or community,” she added.
Dowd told FoxNews.com that who planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents testifying that there was a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of the discovery: the height of the young man.
"It was about a foot [77 m]," says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means pretty much.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about food
National Institutes for Health (NIH) have spent almost $1.5 million studying what small children think about food.
The project, called "The way in which babies and young children perceive foods" is conducted by the University of Chicago and, so far, has determined that the small ones are not prepared to eat smooth food by other people or those who have trained others.
According to the project funding, "adequate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritional healthy diets."
There is evidence that the first food models of babies and young children have long-term consequences for the health of all lives.
The award for this study is that the research on how the baby is to be fed is lacking.
“Despite the complexity and significance of the food selection, psychologists for the development of the child have been surprisingly paying little attention to the study of how babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food, said the financier.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on choice and consumption of food to babies and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have “limited knowledge in the field of food”.
Children between three and six years of age “know more about food than babies and young children” but are “extremely moftrous consumers”.
An actress who played in "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played in the television show "Star Trek: Voyager" was arrested in eastern Tennessee, accused of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that actress Jennifer Ann Lien, 41 years old, who played Kes' role in the television show, is accused of two indecent exposure offences involving children under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.
Officers of the sheriff's office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on September 3, at Lien's residence in Harriman, where they say they found her empty under a blanket on the couch.
The officers said that Lien refused their requests for clothing.
Harriman's chief of police, Randy Heidle, says that Lien was brought with several charges, including the aggravated bodily injury after the April incident in which he said that Lien had entered a police car with a personal car.
He still doesn't know if he has a lawyer.
Police identified the murdered victim found in the Epping Forest
A man whose body in decay was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, 53-year-old Hidir Akskal was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest in north-eastern London.
The man of Turkish origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close links to the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
The last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis showed that he was killed, and the detectives say that his body was probably in the Epping forest for weeks.
Inspector general Jamie Piscopo, from the metropolitan police, said: “Mr. Akskal was well known locally as Boxer Cetin and we hope to find out from the Green Lanes community information to help us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a popular and crowded tourist resort where there is a cafe and a lake for boat rides.
It's also surrounded by streets with heavy traffic.
Please all those who have been in the area for the past few weeks and may have noticed some unusual or suspicious activity to come and discuss with us.
Super Chief: Six Women Jongling Between Maternity and Service
Unlike any other country in the world, except Papua New Guinea, there is no centralized policy on maternity leave paid in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when the managing director of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, announced that she was pregnant with twins, but she was going to take a very short maternity leave and "work" her free time, the 40-year-old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture that awaits the superwoman or nothing.
But is Mayer herself a symbol of the top woman, to be responsible for unrealistic expectations?
How are other women leaders doing?
Seema Patel, lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Bureau of Labour Standards, just got a job in the government in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss ignored her with unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," said her boss.
But if you're going to make a family in the future, you're going to pick up your vacation from now on.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't even get a maternity leave paid as part of her employment contract.
At the time, Patel was single and very focused on her career, and the family was the last thing she had to think about.
But he listened to her boss's advice.
She avoided using her days of medical leave for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child two years ago, she had spent three months on her paid leave.
Six months ago, when the second child was born, Patel could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of vacation that he and he took were entirely unpaid.
Patel says she didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but she has a problem with the structure of work.
“I find it very discouraging for anyone trying to have a family, ” she says.
Send a message: Your country doesn't put any value on you becoming a parent.
Karen Choi, vice president of the Capital Group’s management firm, says that any female employee who is and mother should be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggling between mother quality and job as “a constant battle”.
The secret not to sink is to have an "unbelievably family with you" and a babysitter and a babysitter, to accept that there are things you're not going to be the best ("not everyone can be Martha at the interior settings") and simply go through this.
Choi says he took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two and a half months for the first and ending with six months for the last.
That makes it an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your kid's sick, he's got fever, he's sick and you're sick and you're staying up all night to care for him and you know that the next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
But her company supported her and mentioned that the performance of her investment portfolio had not suffered at all.
When she entered the finance industry after the university, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same path, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
Women who quit the job, then start again no longer have the same chances at top posts well paid, she says.
It is difficult to remain: “The short-term is a sacrifice, but the long-term results are seen”.
Anyway, her children helped her make a sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me go further is that I want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates the scientific researcher and Professor Kelly Posner, 48 years old.
The children know that their mother helps, on their own, to save human lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Columbia University Center for the Risk of Suicide, says that it is important for women to know that they can have a "great objective" in terms of career and achievement.
It's very important for women to think they can have a vision.
Most of them don't allow themselves to believe that," she says.
Once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar when she was pregnant in eight months.
She also helped technology, she says, because she can stop the car and answer the phone after she takes her children or respond to an e-mail on her way.
The twingle between motherhood and a demanding career has been helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. The ability to bring things to an end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33 years old, the Executive Director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says that making maternity and career work together only through private aid networks, such as bonuses, is wrong.
“You shouldn’t be lucky or winning the lottery to succeed,” she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, the deficit health system and the lack of a paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't take care of each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who have just been born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following law school courses, was born to her baby while she was taking the scholarship.
With a husband and a child based on scholarship care, the job leader was able to take a two-week maternity leave and then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashion designer and mother of two children, says that fewer and fewer women will leave their profession if they benefit from more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining the programs established by common agreement and accepting the fact that efficient work does not mean staying over the programme.
At the head of logistic constraints, says Mosko, there is the additional pressure to activate in a domain where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of taste-freeness ("mummy coat" is one of the most serious insults).
“ Imagining is part of our job getting you up or pulling you down, ” she explains.
Mosko's "Permanent Negotiation" for her multiple roles to work harmoniously means to maintain her look and look and a beautiful bag in her hand, from which, however, sometimes one-two-to-two-toy falls.
If he remembers that men are fathers, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York Housing Authority, who handles housing over 400,000 New Yorkers and has more than 11,000 employees, says that motherhood and career does not mean talking about "balance".
The notion of balance is a little wrong.
It's more like a swinger," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom has only three months, she just took a seven-week maternity leave after she was born this year.
"It was a very important time for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take her paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program that meant leaving early or late, so that she could breast-feed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 ("more cheap than therapy") still breast-feeding.
At work, he tried to create a "parent friendly" environment, in which a child's delay is allowed, and the reply to the e-mails should not be sent out of the office.
"The concept and notion of family have changed and is changing very much," Olatoye says.
"Family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to be adapted.
Russian humorous people say they tricked Elton John about a phone call from Putin
For cynics it seemed too nice to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, to Sir Elton John, singer and activist for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram where the Russian leader thanked him for addressing him about the problem, it soon became clear that, whoever called him Monday night, certainly had not been Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that he did not know about that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humorous people admitted that they, not the president, had been the foreign voices from the other end of the call.
“We thought it was unlikely that Putin would want to meet with him or call him, or at least not soon,” says Vladimir “Vovan” Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague, Alexi “Lexus” Stoliarov, was given as President’s spokesman Dmitri Peskov.
"Well, it seems that Elton John actually waited for this phone, so he immediately thought it was really about a conversation with the right people that we were giving," he said for the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said: “Thank you, it was the surprise of the day.”
This day and this conversation were the most wonderful and most enjoyable of my life.
In order to complete John's embarrassing situation, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not give statements on the pharynx speculations.
Based on the comments the singer made on the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his "ridicical" attitude toward homosexuals while militating for LGBT rights in Kiev, especially a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
“I’d like to meet [in Putin], to talk about it,” John said for BBC, saying that although the idea was “probably unrealistic,” it was still worth a try.
Then, Monday evening, the singer sparked the mistrust of observers when she published a message on a social network, claiming that Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling him.
He said that he was “early waiting to meet [the president] in front of him to discuss LGBT equality in Russia.”
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one at the end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for phone calls from many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks English well, played the role of Peskov and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told the journalists on Tuesday that Putin would “be prepared to meet Elton John and answer all his questions,” but at Kremlin no such requests were received from the singer.
Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, “especially because it is not entirely written in correct English.”
We don't think Sir Elton John would have been written with such grammatical errors.
Even before the Russian duet declared its public farce, local media channels already suspected John was the victim of a joke.
Some online users had identified Krasnov as guilty, known for the farces of phone politicians who register and post on his YouTube channel like Vovan222.
The phone calls to the public, then the publishing of the recordings have become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many as the initiator of the genre, has developed his talent of making them the jokes of Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television imitating Anton Gerashchenko, the directly counsellor of the Interior Minister, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Gerashchenko so well that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomyoski, more than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections that led to massive street protests following massive fraud reports.
By acting as Arkadi Dvorkovich, then president's adviser Dmitri Medvedev, convinced the chairman of the electoral commission Vladimir Churov that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, his victims included former President USSR Mihail Gorbachev, the mayor of Kiev and the box champion Vitali Klitschko and Russian sports minister Vitali Mutko, who tricked him to apologize for the drunken behavior of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called the Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukaşenko, becoming the son of the Ukrainian leader who was dismissed, Viktor Yanukoki.
It was so convincing, that the person at the end of the other, whose voice resembled Lukashenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial assertion that he would like to talk to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
Lieutenant Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the Propaganda Law, told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with such an "irrelevant subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain his position to Russia.
The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online survey for readers, in which 39% of respondents felt that Putin and John should meet, and 22% considered that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, over 3 million people die early each year because of air pollution from outside, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and charcoal burned for housing and cooking, but research reveals that a similar alarming reason is the agricultural emissions from Europe and the United States, where it is the main reason for these deaths.
The report warns that if no action is taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projections should trigger an alarm signal for public health agencies all over the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, environmental health expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by the rain of the air are caused by tiny particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
They cause stroke and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million deaths annually, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
Research has not included the effects of indoor air pollution, e.g. from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause 3.4 million more deaths per year.
The new study, published in Nature newspaper, is the first one to highlight various sources of outdoor air pollution and estimated the number of premature deaths caused by them, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel-based plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on different populations, including new information on how pollution affects Chinese and Indian residents.
A third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-extinguishing fuels, such as wood and coal, for heating homes or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognised dangers.
The consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of the 645 000 annual deaths in India and a third of the 1.4 million annual deaths in China.
However, the research found that agricultural ammonia emissions had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the German Chemical Max Planck Institute, which led the research.
A fifth of global deaths are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs and from the over-use of fertilizers.
Amoniaul reacts with traffic and industry exhaust gases and produces tiny particles, being the main reason of the deaths due to air pollution in the east of the United States, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing a fifth of the deaths, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
This has caused only 5% of deaths globally, but the figure could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by the power plant, in particular by those operating with coal, was significant globally, causing one of seven deaths.
In the US it is the main single factor, causing a third of the 55,000 deaths annually, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in the arid regions and with much dust, caused almost a fifth of the global deaths caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, being responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"Sustainment between the high degree of pollution and the high number of residents says the word about public health, but there is no longer any knowledge of pollution sources responsible for premature deaths," says Jerrett.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at global level.
It is currently assumed that all particles are as toxic.
However, if fuel burning is more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, Jerrett says "discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both from scientists and political leaders."
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmosphere specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “The study really stresses the need for air quality control in order to avoid these deaths, especially in areas very populated in Asia.”
A statement by Victor Ponta tenses more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Roman Prime Minister talks about attitudes that remind of Nazism
The relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement of the construction of a fence on the border with Romania, after that on the Salba border, have experienced a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the authorities in Budapest on Monday that he treats refugees "with a bat and inserted".
The Hungarian Diplomacy reacted hard by saying "extremists and liars", but not Victor Ponta left any closer and accused local government officials of being "a shame" for Europe.
Not to be noted that it is not for the first time that Ponta tries to tension the Roman-Hungarian relations through declarations made in delicate or electoral times.
It all started from a statement made on Monday by Victor Ponta, trying to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem is that you have our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not as our Hungarian neighbors treat, with bricks and inserts.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu has put himself in the forefront of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophob feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but we're under the burden of solving the problem.
"We'll treat those people like us," said Victor Ponta on Monday, quoted by the Truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the insertion of refugees, but Chehia was recently in the center of critics after writing numbers on the hands of migrants in several trains, in a gesture that remembered the procedure used by the Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners from the concentration ponds.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian MTI news agency, taken by magyaridok.hu, that the internal political crises that shook Victor Ponta's position make him "extremist and liar".
The Romanian businessman from Budapest was summoned to provide explanations, informaise Mediafax, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inappropriate statements about how Hungary handles the immigrant crisis," says the Hungarian Foreign Ministry.
Levente Magyar, Secretary of State for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in Mae Hungarian, expressed "surprise" in connection with Victor Ponta's "constant attempts to save his controversial moral position by anti-junction lies", stressing the diplomacy of Budapest.
"I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives - but read the story below and you will understand the indignation that I feel, as a European citizen and man, towards the mentality and attitudes that Europe only saw in the 1930s-40s!!" wrote Ponta, on his Facebook account.
He maintains that, like other European politicians, he has "duty" to attract attention and punish "the constant behaviour of government officials at the highest level in Hungary" who are "a shame for the culture and values of the European Union" by "anti-semitic attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"The barma chimata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values", and "what we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!".
During the series, Ponta was invited to Antenna 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea named Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta asked what would happen if the Hungarian military caught and shot or killed some children or women in a speech in which he made more reference to Nazism.
In the dispute, UDMR President Kelemen Hunor also intervened, who considers that Roman authorities should not have a "feeling approach" in connection with Hungary's intention to build a fence at the border.
The UDMR leader states that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or the citizens of Rome, he points out that the fence might even help our country not become an intense route crossed by migrants who want to reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to point out, I mean, we don't have to hysteria, take this whole thing as something against Romania, and we don't have to use it to make it worse, anyway, not really good relationships between the two governments, because it's not the case.
I think any sentimental approach, the visceral isn't okay.
"We must see the rational part, see why we have come here and we must know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, the citizens of Rome and it does not prevent the free movement between the two states, within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The West ignored in 2012 Russia's offer to bring Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia has proposed more than three years ago the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, according to a high official involved at that time in negotiations with closed doors between the western countries and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
Former President of Finland and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Martti Ahtisaari, said the Western powers have not benefited from the proposal ever since.
From 2012 to the present, tens of thousands have died and millions have been forced to flee the country, giving birth to the most serious refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held talks with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
He also stated that during the talks, Russian ambassador Vitaly Churchin offered a plan that included among others and Assad's proposal to give up power at a time after the beginning of peace treaties between regimes and oppositions.
He proposed three things:
One -- we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we must initiate a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
"Three - we must seek an elegant way for Assad to withdraw," Ahtisaari told the Russian ambassador.
But he also said Ahtisaari, the United States, the Great Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator was following his cada, that they ignored the proposal of the Russian ambassador.
"It was a missed opportunity in 2012," Finland's former president continued.
Russia has officially supported Bashar al-Assad over four and a half years of war, insisting that his induction cannot represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow has recently begun sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to defeat the extremists of the Islamic State.

Reports show that the populations of marine animals and plants have been halved in the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis facing animals and marine plants is documented in a study that states that marine species around the globe, including those essential for the safety of human food, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures in several directions at the global oceanic ecosystem combine and create a spin of difficulties for almost all marine creatures, says the WWF Blue Planet report.
Coral reefs are subject to serious decline risks (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and large grass, which depend on many other species, have experienced a significant decline, while the entire population of commercially valued fish, such as macro and tuna, have dropped vertiginos by three quarters compared to the 1970s, the report shows.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the middle of this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to deteriorate, as a result of the increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, causing a directly proportional increase in the level of carbonic acid in the sea.
"Healthy seas are a source of extraordinary natural beauty and wonder and are also a basis for the operation of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, Chief Marine Policy Adviser at WWF-UK, who contributed to the preparation of the report.
"By overfishing, which damage coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we resemble seeds of an ecological economic disaster," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of published scientific literature, but also on the indexes of the living planet, a database maintained by the Zoological Society of London, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It sought a wide variety of marine species, fish, sea turtles and sea citadels - an animal similar to a worm, with rough skin - up to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the algae have decreased by approximately 30% in the last century, while the total mangrove areas have decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp and other aquaculture forms.
During one generation, human activity has caused enormous damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
It takes profound changes to ensure an abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, general director of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have occurred in fishing species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 of the 17 species belonging to the Scrumbidae family - macro, tuna and sardine - have decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without giving any signs of recovery, the report says.
We are in a fishing race that could end up depriving people of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
Excess fishing, destruction of marine habitats and climate change have severe consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, which are based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our struggle to eradicate poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, the scientific director of the ZL, said: “These alarming figures prove how quickly people change plants and animals in the ocean and represent a clear warning about the problems we may face as a result.”
Sea grass: deep underwater “passions” that catch rich sediments in minerals and stabilize the seabed.
Over the last century, the coverage has decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three quarters of them are now threatened and many may disappear during this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to deteriorate.
Deep habitats: very little is known about the deeper areas of the ocean, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by global marine changes.
Steven Gerrard denies the charges of racism that would have been brought to him by his former colleague from Liverpool, El-Haji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography in "My Story" ("My Story"), serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player saying that "he's not really interested in football" and that he's the colleague he liked "the least" in the 17 years he spent at the club.
In response, Diouf would have responded to Gerard on the Senegalese Group Futurs Medias radio station, with quotes attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrad never liked the people of color".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any accusation of racism brought about by him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who had made himself public and before his bad opinion about Diouf, criticized his former colleague's attitude and professionalism.
“I don’t want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons in Liverpool as an example of how things can go on backwards,” he writes.
“It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and doesn’t care about Liverpool at all,” he continued.
For example, the way in which he spat out a huge and vexous fleg in a Celtic fan in a Uefa Cup game at Parkhead in March 2003 is an evidence of his contemptuous and grudgeous behavior.
Diouf turned out to be a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most notorious night being the one on Celtic Park.
The late Senegalese officer was interrogated by the police after the episode of the spit and fined with his two-week salary in the club, amounting to 60,000 pounds being donated to a humanitarian organization at Celtic's election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as being lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard wrote.
I felt he wasn't just willing to make every effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at the Malaysian Sabah club, criticised Gerrard in public and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard "egoist" and claimed that no one on Anfield likes the player who led the team to the League of Champions victory in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "gelos".
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't touch the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the head status, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the world of football, the biggest football experts have framed me between the first seven players at the World Championship and between the first 100 players of the century.
Many great players don't have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go in other countries, I am venerated, while Gerrard is dismissed whenever he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From hero to professional dancer: Alek Skarlatos' quick way to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Skarlatos does not only play the role of the hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, equally discreet and modern, tell the producers.
"Puts many categories and we always look for the most popular of the time," said Deena Katz, executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find himself impressed after that.
He's charming.
He's got something special.
Before he was competing at the famous show - but only a few weeks before - Skarlatos got into the international press after he took a strong stand in the face of danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 on a train full of travelers from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a potential terrorist.
After that, Skarlatos, 22 years old, sent a message on Twitter from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although it may have anticipated some local appreciations - on Friday, at Sacramento, a parade took place in respect of the young man - not expected so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
“Not in a million years I would have thought I would receive this offer,” Skarlatos confessed Saturday, in a break from the dance rehearsals with his partner Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy to me.
Even though prior to the show of Monday night he acknowledged that he was “slightly excited,” he worked as a professional at his first foxtrot, getting scores that brought him almost to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best performances of the series.
Katz and the executive producer at "DWTS" Rob Wade said they wanted to keep a free place in the show for competitors invited to the last hundred meters, such as the case of Skarlatos, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation, who triggered a gun attack on a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance contest.
He searched for social networks, found family members and sent messages to Skallatos.
When it appeared at "Good Morning America" to tell about the incident during which Stone and other passengers were wounded, Katz worked with the sister program at ABC to avoid passing through all media dams.
He supported his five-minute "pleasure", and then he waited eagerly to find out if Skallatos would agree to participate in "DWTS".
"One time everything was very uncertain, because that's so different from what he's doing," Katz confessed.
A little while ago he fought in Afghanistan, and now I was wondering if he was in a dance mood.
Skallatos, who is in a short vacation from the National Guard, didn't even see a whole show until soon.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be just highlighted.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in hand: Noah Galloway, veteran of war, with hand and foot amputated.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, the fan's favorite competitor and finalist last season, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz’s unstoppable “purchase” and “insisting messages,” she said.
“Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army would look and how the image of my friends would be protected,” Skallatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Skallados, the great lover of sport and history, had never danced before, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he was trying to make him more relaxed and give up the military position quite rigid.
But Katz says he is confident that he will adapt and that the spectators will react positively.
He'll get a lot of love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he's done.
"How can you not support it?" said Katz.
But that'll only take a few weeks.
To go on, he has to dance.
Skallados, who is a bachelor and wants to become a cop, says that until now, he has had fun in this completely unknown environment of his.
The program represented the toughest fight, being obliged to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the moments when it was acclaimed in the media and the various premiere ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the U.S. immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with the family.
"This took about a day and a half," he said.
Overall, I stayed at home for four days.
There is a risk in catching a person who attracts media attention, but it is not customary to be in the light of the reflectors, said executive manufacturer Wade.
And the show wants to make sure the competitor manages and has fun.
"Pression is great and we want participants to have a nice experience," Wade said.
“I wouldn’t want Alek ever say, “Aoleu, what did I get into?”
Let's keep his fists having fun.
McRib of McDonald's coming back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-costs to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's franchisers in the country offer this season specialty.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib sandwich.
"At McRib's 2015 promotion, there are about 8,000 restaurants," McDonald's spokesman Lisa McComb said for The Times in an e-mail.
In the United States there are just over 14,300 restaurants of this fast-food.
But according to McComb, the individual French owners decide whether or not they will serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they believe they want their local customers.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients last year, with a video showing reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year at McDonald's participating restaurants.
There is also a website with locations where McRib is used (unfiltered at McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search the nearest place to serve this sandwich.
But a quick search on the site shows that the nearest McRib de Los Angeles restaurant is located in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.

Keith Richards realizes that he'd be preparing new Rolling Stones records
Keith Richards is again in the spotlight with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, the other members of the Rolling Stones band might join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others at Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - have recently met in London and made “clear plans for recordings”, as he says.
Tuesday night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series at iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the band's first LP after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the band wasn't at all inactive.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and performed in several small concerts in L.A., including representatives at Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
In the last of these, they reinterpreted the 1971 classic "Sticky Fingers" LP.
Richards was particularly busy this year, working with the documentary “Keith Richards: Under the Influence”, scheduled to be released on Netflix on September 18.
This year, he released his third solo album "Crosseyed Heart" in a five-year career.
Randy Lewis from The Times described Richards' new album in an interview with the guitarist: “As always, Richards’ harsh voice is a more than distinguished instrument....
But Richards is excited in all 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards says the band will most likely enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He did not give further details, but judging after the last concerts, the band is still very lively.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Batiman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Batiman already went through a few difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them look much simpler than they actually were.
A child actor on television shows like "Silver Spoons", as an adult, has reaffirmed himself as an inexpressive typical in the TV series "Situation of crisis" and in films like "Cummar Chiefs".
The first film he worked on as director was very acidic comedy "Bad Words", in which he also played.
The film was nominated at the International Film Festival in Toronto in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tone film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film he plays Nicole Kidman and Bamane, in the role of the brothers with problems.
The film has as its subject a festival looking for American distribution.
Many reviews of the book considered it a comedy with strong emotional tents; the film reinterprets the story, putting more emphasis on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bamanek says he always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen the book like this," he confessed.
In the book, the topic and thematics are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was dealing with a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The World Premier of Monday evening received an introduction from the festival's programme director Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm especially with the sitcom "The Hogan Family" from the late 1980s and the early '90s, at which Bäman worked. "I have not met too many fans "Hogan Family", Baman said when he got on stage.
However, the few episodes that he directed from that sitcom brought Batiman, now 46 years old, to the Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new film has a family named Fang in the middle.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their performances, for example setting up a bank robbery with acadelas or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) strive to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is renowned for public scandals rather than for service, and Baxter is a novelist and journalist of magazines trying to become famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious surroundings, Annie and Baxter guess it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the story of the children who want to evolve into adult life was directly and deeply reflected in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical one," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10, with parents as managers, and this film has many elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun one.
“It’s a story that I feel connected and that I understand deep down,” he added, “and although I didn’t try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with an untraditional childhood.”
The project started with Kidman, and she's the movie producer, who got the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, he was co-opted Lindsay-Abario, who adapted his own piece "Treaty to reality", in which Kidman played.
Baman confesses that he accepted the chance to direct the film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production "Photograph 51", did not take part in the opening of Monday.
The whole book was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Batemier's film "a clever and caustic adaptation" that "of the typhus of the much over-exploited type of the dysfunctional family, and sometimes the mission of a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet-yellow, incisive and usually very dark."
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very rough portrait" and noted that Batiman "shows visible progress and a higher maturity as film director with this smart, but never too straight or mechanical adaptation."
After Monday's screening, when Baman and Walken got on the stage for the question session, the audience ovated the Walken crowd for a long time.
About Bamien as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that “I was impressed every day.
I couldn't believe the ease with which he changes between the film director's work, which is very difficult, and the stage actor's work.
His concentration is indeed amazing.
In a certain stage of dialogue, Baman standing on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the basement, only a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and sees more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine Batiman the actor talking to Bamien the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
“It seems incredibly interesting to run movies,” Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to benefit me as an actor.
Having the privileged position of being the one responsible for creating all the experiences for the public, not just one tool in that orchestra, to be an actor, is a complete thing.
Without counting on that... actor wants a foreground.
During the question and answer session, Bateman confessed that after reading the script, he immediately thought of Walken for Caleb's role, but also of Carter Burwell's composer for the soundtrack.
Mainly known for the long-standing friendship with Coen brothers, Burwell made up the soundtrack for two other films at the Toronto Festival: the animated film "Anomalysa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legend Gangsters", by Brian Helgeland about the English gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the soundtrack for Todd Haynes' "Carol".
"Works with distant or obtuse tones seem very interesting," says Bateman, giving more explanations on Tuesday.
Navigate among those shades and guide the harmonious and somehow elegant audience from one to one tone to the next throughout the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate through the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bakeman has made yet another bold step, both as director and actor, in a career dominated by reinvention and decision, a mix of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bateman confessed when he finished introducing his film to the world premiere of Monday, "Well, bad, he came out exactly as I wanted."
The festival wants as at Oscars about the story of the Boston Globe investigation of pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 on the loto?
An X-LOTTO ticket worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for one month.
The unregistered ticket to the X-Lotto extraction was bought from the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd on Saturday, August 15.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, there were 16 other winning entries throughout Australia, which shared the unique prize-winning fund of the $4 million X-Lotto.
SA Lotterias asks all those who bought X-Lotto tickets from the Ingle Farm Lotterias Kiosk to check them out as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the extraction X-Lotto 3555 on Saturday, August 15, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, Manager Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he is looking forward to getting the good news that the one who won the big prize checked his ticket to X-Lotto.
“We have tried hard to spread the news, because a person is our winner and has no idea whatsoever,” she said.
Criminal detectives search the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where was last seen the missing man Daniel Hind
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of her journey the night she was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search the house since her brother's disappearance.
"I was hoping they'd look into the house, we weren't informed they'd do it," she said.
Miss Hind also says that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have many other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Anyway, we want him at home and put an end to the stories.
Until 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 km of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 miles of new highways and repair 17,000 miles of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of works for the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all part of the pan-European transport corridor, is among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure increased road safety and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the trafficking of cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the plundering of Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgarian national law was restored to fit the new context, placing the emphasis on prohibiting cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in particular the Directorate-General for Organized Crime (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and illegal selling of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said that Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed in the third place, after Italy and Greece, in the top of trafficking in objects and cultural goods.
Bulgarian Interior Minister further pointed out that trafficking in cultural objects and destruction of historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a widespread phenomenon, described as a very serious war crime.
He insisted that concerted and decisive measures are needed to stop the intentional destruction of history.
Director General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, noted that footage of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrates that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
The participants at the Wednesday conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must join in order to stop illegal trafficking in cultural goods in the war-end country.
Aerojet Rocketdyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc said it is expected to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine until 2019, to replace a Russian engine that will soon be banned, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Vice President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to make statements on the fact that Aerojet offered USD 2 billion to buy United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture company with equal shares for missile launches by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say that the auction amount is a strategic move of the Aerojet to overcome its rival Blue Origin, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, which develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan missile.
ULA says the Blue Origin engine program is about two years before the AR-1 engine from Aerojet, an assertion that Aerojet contradicts it.
The work on new engines became a priority after US legislators approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for launching military or spy satellites after the annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck states that Aerojet tests engine hardware equipment, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to match both the Atlas 5 ULA rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine and the new Vulcan rocket that develops ULA and which costs about $1 billion.
Aerojet says it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into Atlas 5 than to develop a completely new engine and rocket, as is currently going to be ULA.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet planned to start testing large-scale engines in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be postponed if the company did not receive sufficient funds from the Air Force in expected contracts at the end of the first semester of the 2016 fiscal year, which began in October.
She further claims that the whole company was anxious to see how the Air Force would share a funding of approximately 160 million USD between rival competitors.
He also says that Aerojet was thinking about trying other private financing options for the engine, but did not provide details.
Competition from the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding and the Air Force covers two-thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technologies), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies, have self-financed the engine creation process and say they are not necessarily looking for government funding.
AB InBev beer manufacturer plans a merger worth 275 billion USD with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the largest beer-producing company in the world, approached rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) with regard to a levy that would form a colossus that would produce a third of the total amount of beer in the world.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately $275 billion at current prices and would combine the dominance of AB InBev' in Latin America with that of SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, but also with their beer factories in Asia.
"The true attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also several places in Asia and Latin America," said analyst Andrew Holland of the General Society.
AB InBev and other top beer companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weak spots in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the company on the second place in the world and the producer of over 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said Wednesday that he was informed by the intention of AB InBev to make an offer, which must happen at the latest by 14 October, according to British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its marketing cost reduction policy, previously orchestrated the purchase of Burger King, Ketchup Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A close source of the SAB mentioned that it's too early to say what it's gonna do, because they didn't get any offer.
"At this point, we are in the process waiting and deciding," the source said.
Speculations regarding mergers, which would most likely cause concerns about breaching competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have circulated for many years.
The time of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions by AB InBev, follows a decrease of approximately 15% of the price of SABMiller shares from August.
"It's the exact moment they were expecting," said analyst Phil Gorham at Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least $40 (62 USD) for SAB Miller action, maybe even £45, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to $130 billion, which would also include SABMiller's debt.
This would be the most significant M&A of 2015, which is already announced a record year after the 2008 financial crisis in terms of the sum of the transaction, and one of the largest purchases since 1980 here.
The SAB shares were approaching 19.9 per cent to 36.14 pounds, giving him a $90 billion stock exchange capitalization.
AB InBev actions reached 6.4%.
Rivali Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could seek another fusion as defense strategy, as happened in the previous year when it offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottleneck with Coke (KO.N) and in recent weeks there has been the suspicion of a combination with Diageo or the Australian Coca-Cola Amatel (CCL.AX).
The overall rate on the beer market of AB InBev, the producer Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 211% in 2014 while SABMiller was 15%, according to the experts in the Plato Logic industry.
AB InBev intends a ratio between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) twice from the present 2.5.
It is possible to achieve the objective in 2016, the closest realistic date to which the transaction could be concluded, so that it would have how to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought the company producing Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with 52 billion dollars, the largest ice-money acquisition in history at that time. he let the report grow to over 5 times.
Such a big climb would allow him to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
Families that control AB InBev have a little more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders of SABMiller are the manufacturer of Cigarettes Altira (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Othersa refused to give statements that they were approached by AB InBev, but on 9 September, her financial director, Billy Gifford, said at an analysis conference that she regularly evaluates the investment in SABMiller and that "this time we believe that maintaining assets is in the interests of our shareholders."
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, head of investment in Europe, equity at Allianz Global Investors, who holds shares in both companies, says AB InBev has faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of small debt income reaches some 15%.
But we believe that the profit gained from this acquisition would be a disappointing percentage of 8%, after 10 years," Dwane said.
In any combination there are significant weights related to the breach of competition rules, in particular in the United States, where companies hold about 70% of the beer market.
"The savings that could be made to distribution operations are great, and the traps related to the violation of competition rules are even bigger," said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent of the company's shareholding held by SABMiller in accordance with the operating agreement governing it.
A change of control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get another 8 percent and appoint a new CEO of the company.
Molson, with his seat in Denver, would have the right to the first and last offer for the remaining 50 percent.
A spokesman for Molson refused to comment on whether the company was interested in an auction, but Molson's actions increased by more than 12 percent to their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is the SABMiller's CR Snow partnership with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao in China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that after the divestment, the combined group could hold a 28% share of the global market.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warsaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accused a former Air Force pilot of helping Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would subsequently give funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, said Wednesday police officers for Reuters, in a rare case targeting those who help finance activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban militants, at a hospital in the eastern city of Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in a May attack on a bus with members of the Muslim minority and ismaelian, after which 45 people died, said to the journalists of the Naveed Khawaja Senior Police Officer of the Department for the Combating of the Territory of the Province.
He will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has funded the Afghan Taliban more, we are still conducting research to see if he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him anyone else," said the officer.
"Hamed also offered financial aid for AQIS," he said, referring to the Al Qaeda organisation on the Indian Subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, which face activism, corruption and murder.
After, in December, the Taliban prisoners massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to suppress activism.
There have been tough attacks, while the army has also advanced to tribal regions outside the law of the border with Afghanistan.
However, the militant groups remain a threat, and many of them have taken over from Pakistani cities under the control of very weak police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52 years old, used to preach at a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Housing Authority.
His public sermons were moderate, but in particular radicalism, the police said.
He studied at the Pakistani Air Force College in Sargodha and left Pakistanese Air Forces in 1998, said another security officer for Reuters under anonymity.
He subsequently entered the paint industry and chemicals.
The rapper Rick Ross rejected his copyright application for "Everyday I'm hustlin"
The New York rapper Rick Ross cannot claim his copyright for the words 'Everyday I'm hustlin', decided by an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO musical group, who sold shirts with a similar verse, 'Everyday I'm shufflin'.
In a decision published on Tuesday by the Miami Federal Court, district judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross' slogan, prominent part of his debut landmark in 2006, "Hustlin'", is a short expression for which the courts have mentioned several times that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' court ruling undermines the process of violating the copyright that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, challenged him against the LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the electropop duel in Los Angeles, made up of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own famous 2010 song "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflin".
The hip hop star said that the LMFAO song is "an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of the Hustlin' song."
He also sued Kia Motors for the use of the song "Party Rock Anthem" in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright by selling t-shirts and other products with the shufflin' slogan.
In Tuesday's ruling, Williams says that "Hustlin'" as a song, is protected by copyright law.
But Ross' three-word slogan is composed of ordinary words and cannot have copyright, she said.
The judge compared it with other famous music versions of the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it's "a short expression, which all courts unanimously declared as impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the song of the band LMFAO is an unauthorized copy of "Hustlin'".
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al., at the U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, Nr.

Dr Carson is approaching Trump in the latest presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the latest presidential survey for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson is approaching the bomb leader Donald Trump in the preliminary republican elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped into seven-point polls.
After 27% of Trump's support in the latest CBS/New York Times poll, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, arrives in the second place with 23 percent, followed by Bush, the television star Mike Huckabee, the senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with 6%.
Support from Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from early August to early September for Trump, Carson, Governor of Ohio John Kasich and former Executive Director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Supporting the last two remains, however, in single-digit numbers.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and the one who goes further on the Bush family standards, fell by seven percentage points in a month, while the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker fell by eight points.
In the last survey, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson drew more support than Trump among college graduates (29% compared to 21%), while Trump is ahead of Carson in the preferences of university-free voters (30% compared to 19%).
Trump is supported more by men than by women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents said they were determined to support in their state's preliminary elections.
Those who said they knew who they were going to vote with are twice as supportive of Trump as they were of Carson.
It's still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters for preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey conducted between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday before a presidential republical debate.
Carson's ascension to this survey reflects that of the senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of Democrats to the president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The last follow-up of the presidential nominations of the CBS shows that Sanders went up with 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, New Hampshire, respectively, among the Democratic voters for the preliminary.
A specialist in ethics claims that sexual robots should be banned
An ethical specialist in the robotics industry launched a campaign to ban the development of sexual robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, an expert in robotics at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
“Sex thefts seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and models of how they will show, what roles they will have, are very disturbing,” she said for BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual robots is not one against sex but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
He's inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology," she said for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will help increase the level of sexual exploitation.
Although the sexual robots that are now manufacturing are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that these are the first step towards something more sinister.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we need to stop it from the front.
Certainly, the industry seems to take the lead.
A few years ago, the company producing True Companion inflatable dolls launched Roxxxy, the "first sexual robot in the world".
However, concern about the potential dangers posed by artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among major industry representatives.
Even this spring, the executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that in five years something really dangerous will happen.
In an interview with BBC in December last year, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race."
United Kingdom welcomes the first refugees from Syria - RT UK
In the following days, Great Britain will receive the first refugees who fled the Syrian war, the Interior Minister Theresa May announced.
They will receive assistance under the extended reinstallation programme of the government.
Refugees seeking asylum arrive from camps on the border with the country of the end of war.
They are the first of the 20,000 refugees that the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Minister of Internal Affairs said the government is "working fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that the assistance and support that they need and deserve should be put in place.
I know that the honourable members and the general public want to learn more about the number of persons and the date on which they arrive.
May mentioned that the government must also make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when they arrive.
I must point out that the level of expansion requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything is done properly.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister, Richard Harrington, will continue to keep the Chamber in mind in this regard.
But I am pleased to tell the Chamber that we expect to meet the first wave of refugees in the coming days and work quickly to plan more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron attracted the anger of parliamentarians and militias when he unveiled the plan for the government's refugees, many of whom felt that the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron told the House that the United Kingdom "will rise to the height of its moral responsibility" and will receive 20,000 refugees from the camps in the Middle East until the following general elections.
He added that refugees will not automatically receive complete asylum, but a humanitarian status that will allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics noticed that the figures were only 12 refugees a day, and the former Liberal Democratic Parliamentarian Paddy Ashdown said the measures were “depositors”.
Further, Ashdown revealed that children included in this scheme are to be deported when they are 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
Important public figures and personalities have also condemned the measures.
In a joint letter, great names such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin First, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the response to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of countries close to the conflicts that drive people out of their homes," they wrote.
Ruble is redirected to global insecurity fund - RT Business
The Russian Ruble strengthened on Wednesday, being traded with 65.66 compared to the US dollar and with 73.98 compared to the euro at the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say that the return of the ruble occurred due to the investor's reaction to current global market disturbances caused by Chinese weights, the possible increase in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve and the over-reacted response to cheap oil.
Brent's rates increased by 61 cents on Wednesday to 48.36 USD per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 more cents, at $45.31 per barrel.
MORE MULT CITIZENS: most likely the interest rate will increase in the United States by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is possible that volatility will say its word, fueled by insecurity over China and at the time of growth of the federal interest rate, which will continue to tone for oil and rub prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, an expert in monetary policy strategies on emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukail and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, started buying rubles.
The global markets are waiting with their soul at their mouth for the Federal Reserve Thursday decision, whether or not the interest rate will increase.
Markets believe that what could be the first growth in nine years of the US interest rate will not happen and have traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together in the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the U.S. government and companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephony company on the development of a database that allows drone pilots to book air space blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Collaboration is the result of a very restless spread with regard to the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial planes.
A new Forrester report describes the potential negative effect in living colors.
“Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco,” notes research.
Without a common set of technology protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to Detta O'Cathain, a baroness in the room of Lorzilor, the concern was amplified on the merits of reports on events at the limit of the production of an accident and the operation of drones above football stadiums, close to nuclear power stations and Eiffel Tower.
"In the last two years, over 400 calls to the metropolitan police have been related to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
Which is the solution: to build a system to target all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, whether they are driven by commercial pilots or amateurs.
“As more and more small drones carry out commercial flights to low altitudes, beyond the level of pilot visibility, or even completely autonomous flights, a certain air traffic management infrastructure is required to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, for example the delivery of packages in cities,” she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as the design of the air space, methods of avoiding unfavourable weather and wind conditions, congestion management, route planning and redirection by methods similar to the rules set out for road traffic, such as signs and bands.
They are expected to have a functional prototype until 2019.
The drone industry is expected to explode in the European Union over the next years.
"We already see small and innovative EMS companies in the United Kingdom using this technology with significant energy, agriculture and media industries," says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 licences for operations with commercial drones were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Dislike button: Why does Facebook want to know what makes you sad
“Look Back” works similarly, bringing together the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for many users inside the virtual borders of Facebook, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, a empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge amount of Facebook - about USD 240 billion after the last statistic - is due to the amount of unimagined consumer data it owns.
Every interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable picture of complex, in a permanent update, about your person and the preferences you have.
This is valuable first for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to carefully choose which people to see ads on Facebook, selecting those who are most interested in their products.
A empathy button adds another set of data and certainly opens a door for another type of advertising agents to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who " appreciate" a national team of football, charities and promoters want to address those who, for example, "empathize" with the refugee crisis.
It will also likely change what you see at Nouveaus.
Facebook uses incredible intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that huge content universe you could see in the smallest stream you actually see.
This algorithm essentially depends on what you considered interesting in the past and, above all, what you liked.
There is no doubt on Facebook that many interesting posts, but unfortunate ones don't enter the algorithm, because people don't feel they should appreciate them.
But if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it might take the decision to remove this kind of post from Newities.
Facebook has carried out experiments in the past to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional state and, above all, how it is transmitted from one person to another.
Academic environmental representatives call this "emotional contamination" and, while it sounds sinister, it is probably only a simple attempt on Facebook (and opened up with their agreement) to better understand how their platform works and if they can adjust algorithms to distribute more elements.
What will happen to the empathy button remains at Facebook latitude.
The real habit is how the decision of a single company to add a single button to its services can produce so many speculations.
The reason that this happens may be that the decisions taken by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that function hidden - have profound consequences on us today.
Now we spend a significant part of life in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and one that leads a constant struggle for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions it takes, including with regard to new buttons, will be the ones considered best to remain on the surface in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with that and soon they'll have a button for it.
Biometric bracelets can anticipate crises in people with autism
During ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team established that the body's signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, thus giving the assistants the opportunity to take the right measures.
Kids with autism that we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say he hurts his head or that "he's too loud here" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body is transmitting to us, and it's necessary to do this in a gentle and unintrusive way.
For example, simple viewing of colors in an application can show the level of agitation. Red can be used to warn about a change of behavior, and blue for lack of interest, giving the assistant understanding that the person is bored and needs encouragement.
Brakes data can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping caretakers understand the overall picture of how the person responds to different situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to make it very clear that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific for autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of customer services at the Wirral Austic Society, who will present technology at the Auttech 2015 conference on Manchester autism and technology on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that you can bring in the quality of their life care technology. Now, apps for iPad give, of course, a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help the kids learn how to play hide and hide.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can truly change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charitable organisation for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and are also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria “in the coming weeks”
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air raids on the Isis targets in Syria, announced on Wednesday the government, only a few days after President François Hollande declared the intervention a "necessary".
France will unveil the first air raids on the Islamic State jihadist group in Syria "in the coming weeks," said defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Wednesday.
The French Air Force is conducting recognition missions in Syria on September 8, and the attacks will follow “as soon as we have clearly identified targets,” Le Drian said for the French Inter radio station.
Le Drian said Tuesday in parliament that the Islamic State made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
“In the city of the Sea there is a very powerful offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy the one we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what remains of it,” he said.
France is part of a coalition led by the United States, which has been bombarding Isis positions in Iraq for a year, but Holland has changed the strategy last week to expand its actions in Syria, under conditions under political pressure is piled up on the fund of the jihadist threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf have already been involved in attacks on Isis militants in Syria.
IOS 9 ads lock feature will make your phone even faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is released on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying about online publishers - is the ability to easily block ads while browsing the web.
The new functions will allow users to download third party extensions that block cookies, advertisements, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using Safari's mobile version of Apple browser.
On the test, it has been shown that after blocking advertisements, news sites like New York Times are twice as fast as Reuters.
Locking down advertisements also helps users maintain the use of data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop advertising locking tool, has launched its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its creator plans to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People who use software programs to block advertisements meet a few constraints.
The advertisements are still displayed in applications (from here wins Apple money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such ads lock-up features.
However, their use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development raises great challenges for online media, which is largely offered to consumers free of charge and has been financially supported for many years by advertising.
One report says that blocking advertisements could cost online publishers nearly 22 billion in revenues generated from commercials only this year.
In order to enable closing of ads in iOS 9, users must download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama met King Felipe VI of Spain on Tuesday at the White House, where the two discussed various subjects, but which were probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the king approached the subject of the struggle against the Islamic State and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - which is already facing hundreds of thousands of people who left their country of origin to go west.
"Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travel, and the problem of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened in the past few months.
Obama also emphasized the importance of cooperation, especially in the context in which the Spanish territory of Catalonia will vote in the elections that will take place this month.
“With regard to external policy, we have made a firm commitment to maintain relations with a strong and united Spanish,” Obama said.
The Supreme Commander also told King Felipe that he would like to visit his country before the end of his term of office in 2017.
"We welcome you with open arms," Felipe answered.
The first lady, Michelle Obama, gave the Queen a tour of the White House and had a talk at tea.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States from the ascent to the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to visit South Florida.
Alfre Woodard joins the Luke Cage series team
Famous actress Alfre Woodard joined the future distribution of the series Netflix Luke Cage from Marvel. She will be Mike Colter's antagonist, who plays the role of the superhero as the title of the series.

There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
Model Christie Brinkley and musician John Mellencamp were seen Monday having dinner together, triggering the rumor that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at Bowery Hotel in New York City, where photos surprised Brinkley with joy and smile.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing blues, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken blouses, slippers and boots.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend who split up and with whom she constantly makes peace, the actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the star of Message for you at the NBC's Today show, saying it was “an angel who was sent to me and I am very happy.”
He added that "no one ends until it ends."
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, took her position for Seventeen magazine, following her mother's footsteps.
Arctic mosquito wheels are big enough to take down a karib
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable because of the increasingly hot climate, but global warming has proved beneficial to others.
One of these benefit species is the arctic mosquito.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, the warmer temperatures in the Arctic region have allowed the mosquitoes here to appear early and grow larger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic mosquitoes.
Their analysis anticipates a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult mosquitoes under a 2 degrees Celsius increase in temperature.
Tensions are small, but they are important members of the Arctic Trophy chain and the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists better anticipate how a growing population of mosquitoes could affect the karib with which they feed, the birds and insects that feed with them and the plants they pollen.
To build its demonstration, the scientists at Dartmouth have combined their results with the results of laboratory experiments that have investigated how the temperature influences insect development and the predisposition to be hunted by predators.
Although rising temperature makes higher mosquitoes more vulnerable to coleopters, it also gives them an early start in spring and makes the development of their larvae faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
Many more mosquitoes mean a larger population, which can develop only to the extent that it can be supported by insect food sources.
The ability of the mosquitoes to transform their improved survival rate into an improved breeding rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies note that the administration of antidepressants in pregnant women has no effect on the neuronal or behavioral development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) present an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have stated that depression is an even greater risk for women and their children, which is why they should be treated.
"These studies add an increasing set of evidence regarding the safety of the administration of antidepressants during pregnancy," said John Thorp, Deputy Chief Editor of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, so far the evidence seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are greater than those of antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the motor development of children treated with SSRI, analyzing the data of 51 404 children in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, investigating the effects of using SSRI for the development of motor skill at the age of 3 years.
Researchers found that 381 mothers had been using SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of these had been treated with long-term medicines.
Although the exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in motor development, researchers wrote in the study that the association “was not as significant as giving the delay a clinical significance”.
A group of researchers from the Australian Adelaide University conducted a data review for 49 000 women from the Danish National Birth cohort to discover the effects of SSRI administration on the behaviour of children up to the age of 7.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
In 210 children whose mothers had been treated with SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared with 231 children who were more prone to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more likely to bleed after birth if they are treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30,198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5% between 11 and 16% if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers reported.
Researchers said that, although the study linked the administration of SSRI with increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information that researchers had about women's specific medical conditions - that could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
“It is possible for women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced pregnancy stage to have been those with the most severe stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal bleeding, not antidepressants,” says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study, we do not recommend that women stop treatment against depression during pregnancy, but be closely monitored to reduce the risk of potential bleeding.
Matthew is being accused of murder in the case of murder of students at the University of Virginia
The man charged with the murder of the student Hannah Graham at Virginia University was charged with murder in case of a student at the University of Virginia missing in 2009, they announced the authorities on Tuesday.
The great jury in Albemarle, Virginia, charged Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. on Friday, 33, in Charlottesville, for the murder of Morgan Harrington, the officials say.
Matthew is also accused of kidnapping with intent to rape.
Each head of charge receives the maximum prison sentence on life.
Harrington, 20 years old, disappeared from a Charlottesville concert in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say that the news of the prosecution has brought them ease.
“Six years we’ve been working on this for this purpose, ” says Gil Harrington, Morgan’s mother.
I'm thrilled to know that when you take someone's life, you have to endure the consequences for your act.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to be seated.
Police say there is a medical-legal link between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 sexual abuse in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty for the latter and awaits the sentence in this case.
He's staying in prison in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew accused of murder qualified in the death of a student from Virginia University
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17, 2009, together with his friends, to a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington came out of John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't go back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a taxi around 20:30 in front of the sand.
Harrington was dressed in a black shirt with the Pantera band.
After her disappearance, Harrington's bag and cell phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends began an extensive search by Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. The men from Metallica wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt was found near a line of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated lan, in a farm south-west of Charlottesville.
During the time of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew had worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it is not clear whether that time overlapped with the date Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the event of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were related to DNA evidence.
The investigators did not make public at this time the details of the new evidence that led them to put Matthew on charges for Harrington's murder.
Defence lawyer Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham's case, refused to make statements.
The announcement of the accusation comes two days after the one-year anniversary of Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both of them were young students who disappeared when they went out to the city in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18-year-old from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a central mall near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the first days after Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at the meetings and views organized for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says she endured for her daughter speculation and media critics that should be silenced by the new charges against Matthew.
"There have been conversations all this time about "Why wear a short skirt?" and "Do you look for it with the candle?" but this kind of question and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we have to deal with a predator on the trail of hunting," said Harrington.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault on a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 years old at the time of the attack, told the jury that one night in September, while she was coming home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
She took her to a green zone, beat her up and squeezed her throat, then attacked her sexually.
“I thought the end came, that I should scream unstoppable,” the woman confessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew suddenly ran away, said the woman.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew may have been scared of the lights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was convicted years later after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will receive the sentence in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said he'd most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least today I've taken a step," says Dan Harrington.
Did Jon Snow die or not?
Kit Harington Actor gives us a hint
Actor Kit Harington gave an important clue to the fate of the character or the series Games of Thrones, Jon Snow, who was killed at the end of the fourth season.
In an interview with Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knew the duration of the contract or HBO post, according to Digital Spy.
Asked how many seasons he would still appear, he said he couldn't talk about it.
Let's just say that the series will be part of my life for a while, I'll probably be over 30 when it's over.
But one thing is certain.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then it will be the time when I bury myself in long film projects," said the actor.
The show's back on the little screens in the spring of next year.
Fans Games of Thrones triggered a hysteria after the end of the fourth season, when the character Jon Snow was stabbed and launched several theories, according to which one will be restored to life.
Moreover, the Romans created an event on Facebook, called "The Photo of Jon Snow", 40 days after the end of the season, which spread over 36,000 supporters.
Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission took its decision on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Medium" programmes, both interrupted at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a statement by the representative of Romania of the European Commission following this decision, about EUR 120 million will be transferred to the Roman authorities in the following period.
I am happy to announce the release of these payments and appreciate the efforts of the Roman authorities to improve management and control systems under the two programmes.
It is important that Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weaknesses and solving problems.
"I hope that the masses will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," said European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Corina Cretu.
"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the head of Hungarian diplomacy reacted.
Peter Szijjarto asked European Socialists to stop "the campaign of lies" at Hungary.
Referring to the statements made by Harlem Desir, French Secretary of State for European Affairs, on the fence built by Hungary, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European immigration strategy", insisting that national borders must be protected.
Romania wants to hit the rugby World Cup
Romania's rugby national is ready for a big surprise at the World Cup that will start on Friday in Britain.
"Stejari" proposed to obtain two wins in Group D.
"We want two winners, with the Canadian and Italian teams," Mihai Macovei, captain of Romania said.
The National T-shirt is part of Group D at the World Cup in England, alongside France, Ireland, Canada and Italy.
The first game of Romania since the 2015 World Cup will be played on 23 September, the opponent going to be France.
Refugee Crisis: There is no solution
President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, announced that on Thursday a decision on the possible convening of a European Union summit on migration in Europe will be taken.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann asked on Tuesday to organize a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis.
In a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel stated that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot handle the refugee crisis alone.
The head of the German executive expressed support for Berlin's recent decision to impose border controls in front of the massive influx of asylum seekers, noting that the measure is intended to facilitate the registration of refugees.
On the other hand, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redistribute refugees between Member States on the basis of compulsory quotas - has decided to organise an extraordinary EU summit.
EU Home Affairs Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday evening, failed to adopt the new proposal to urgently redeploy 120,000 refugees between EU Member States, submitted on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the emergency relocation mechanism for refugees, provides for the rapid redistribution of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, new controversial cartoons
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo again raises controversy, after publishing cartoons that mock the response of predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries affected by war.
In the most recent issue of the publication, it has attracted attention again, as well as critics on social networks, writes Reuters Agency.
One of the cartoons fills with an overwhelming image of Aylan Kurdi, the innocent Syrian boy, whose body arrived on one of the beaches in Turkey, after an effort to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing shows a child in short shorts and T-shirts, with the girl down on the seafront, next to an ad panel offering two menus for children at one price.
"So close to succeeding," is the message accompanying the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack from the Paris building in January, is accompanied by the message "The proof that Europe is Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who goes on the water, while a smaller character wears short shorts with his feet up in the water, the first saying "crestinis go on the water", takes the second "Muslim children drown."
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after an attack by Islamist militants in January, following repeated threats after the mocking of the prophet Muhammad.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, drastic fined in Russia
The French Auchan supermarket chain was fined at over $370,000 by Russian officials, charged with food security breachs.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian agency for consumer protection Rospotrebnadzor, said the fines total more than 25 million rubles, i.e. 372,000 dollars, reports the agency Associated Press, quoted by US News.
The reasons why these fines were granted were not stated, and Auchan made no comment.
The French chain of supermarkets is also the target of Russian agricultural agents' accusations, which argue that some meat products have been found to be infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come in a period of tension between France and Russia, on the subject of extending the sanctions of the European Union and the decision of France to cancel an agreement on the supply of Russian Mistral ships.
The Roman Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the news that Hungary could raise a metal fence to our country's border.
MAE shows that it has been briefed in connection with this decision and that it is not a politically correct gesture.
MAE shows, in a statement submitted to the Journal.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced publicly.
On the other hand, the MAE has informed in due course of the urgency of the relevant decision-makers in Romania in connection with this situation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a fence between two EU Member States and being strategic partners is not a politically correct gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian Party, which appears in the communication.
Hungary makes plans to build a metal fence on a segment of the border with Romania, in the context of the immigrant crisis, stated Tuesday Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, quoted by Mediafax.
"The mass is necessary for the traffickers of people who pass through Serbia to change their routes, and there is the probability of heading towards Romania," the head of Hungarian diplomacy explained.
"The guard would begin at the point of the border between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the pressure of migration moved to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants crossing the Serb territory on their way to the European Union were trying to shake the fence built by the Hungarian authorities through its eastern end, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can bypass the fence through Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Hungarian government has allocated 22.2 billion forints (€71.8 million) to build a controversial metal fence at the border with Serbia, a distance of 175 kilometers, and for special centres needed to hunt immigrants.
The security initiative is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
There's no need, he'll stay there
Cornelius Vadim Tudor's unspoiled body will not be deposited in the Senate of Romania, despite his desire to do so expressed by the politician's widow.
According to a release of Ziare.com, the Senate's Permanent Office discussed, on Tuesday, a request by Doine Vadim Tudor, concerning the approval of the unsatisfied body of former Senator Cornelius Vadim Tudor in the Senate headquarters.

Senator PNL Teodor Atanasiu maintained that this request "is not in accordance with the geographical position of Romania somewhere in Europe".
It also transmits Agerpres, the senators have kept a moment of recall in the memory of former PRM leader, at the proposal of Senator UNPR Serban Mihailescu.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died on Monday evening around 6:30.

Are refugees coming to Romania?
Mayors in the villages of the border, questions about accommodation
Mayors in the border towns of Arad county are asked by the Police and Border Police, these days, about the accommodation for any refugees that could arrive in Romania, but also for Jandarmi, if they will be mobilized to the border.
The Edile of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were also conducted with farmers in the area, who were asked to report on the present presence of any strangers near the border.
We had discussions with border police, national police and local police, as well as with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I asked the farmers, who have works in this period on arable land, to be careful and to report any movement," the building said.
Immigrant crisis in the bell tower in Hungary: Blondes and water cannons at the border
This, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said the police asked for information on the accommodation available in the case of a wave of refugees.
We've been asked how many people we can hunt.
In our community, we have no refugee space.
We believe that such special centres don't even have to stand at the border, because they're harder to control here, because migrants are tempted to escape, because they're not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be better to establish such centres in areas beyond the border," the mayor of Iratosu, Papp Atila Joseph, said.
On the other hand, the mayor of Dorobanti, Vincentiu Almasi, said that he had been asked so many places for refugees as well as for intervention forces, in case they would be mobilized in the area.
The police were interested if we could hunt and gendarmi.
We could find places at the Cultural Way, but for refugees we have no possibility of accommodation.
"I've been questioned about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," Vincenti Almasi said.
He added that at the local police station, "beginning on Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it has established itself permanently."
"There's always a cop on the job, and the locals know that they have to inform if they notice any stranger in the area," said the building.
The representatives of the Mayor Pilu said they could house at least one hundred people, on the Cultural Way, the information being provided to the police, upon their request.
The mayor of the city of Curtici, Nicolae Aanite, also said that there are accommodation areas in the former headquarters of local public finance, but there are needed facilities here.
Also, a former border police barracks could be arranged to host refugees.
The representatives of the Arad County Police Press Office did not provide an opinion on the question of mayors during this period, only confirming that "in border areas of Arad county patrol activities have been intensified".
Army Club Commander announces radical measures against the Becali Star
Army Sports Club Commander, Colonel George Boroi, announces a series of radical steps that will be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Although the two parties have negotiated a settlement, Boroi maintains that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historical palmarage of the "ros-bastrilors".
The team that won the Champions Cup is on the break for now.
"It's not a historic break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have the team, but things can change next year," Boroi said at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the process by which he seeks damage from the Becali team will continue.
The period we refer to by the ICCJ decision is very clear.
We need to recover the damage from FC Stara, the team that used the Stara brand without the consent of the owner - i.e. CSA Stara.
It appears very clearly and the continuity of the section, which was in fact permanent of the Army Club.
"So the Bucharest Star football team, in one form or another, but in one legal form, must exist as a continuation of the perfumes it has so far in the palm trees," says George Boroi.
The Star of Becali and the Army Club were in the open war since the end of last year, when the supreme instant decided that the military are the ones holding the Star.

The region that "cold" millionaires
The Asia-Pacific millionaires will form, this year, the wealthiest people in the world, thanks to the wealth accumulated in China and India, show a published study by Capgemini and RBC Health Management on Wednesday.
According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated assets of the Asian Pacific millionaires will exceed the total $15,800 billion recorded in 2014, as well as the assets of the North American millionaires, who currently represent the richest people in the world, with a combined fortune of $16,200 billion, transmits AFP.
The study specifies that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, known as the High Net Worth Individuals financial jargon, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, compared to 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are people who can invest at least one million dollars, without you counting the value of real estate and other possessions.
"In the future, HNWI wealth is expected to grow more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, most of the new assets coming from the emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," the study by Capgemini and RBC Health Management shows.
The report estimates that China and India represent almost 10% of HNWI's overall wealth and are responsible for 17% of the global increase in new assets after 2006.
China, the second world economy after the United States, had in 2014 a number of 890,000 millionaires with a combined fortune of $4,500 billion, growing by 17.5%, respectively 19.3%, compared to 2013.

"Dorel" mounted the traffic lights backwards
In Suceava, the workers mounted a traffic light upside down, so instead of being aware that they've waited for 4 seconds, passersby get the message "h", which I don't know how to decipher.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Everyone goes through the way he cuts his head off.
Two boys were being taken up by a car because they passed the red.
"The Politicians at the Route should be here, to help, until the world gets used to it," said a woman for the mentioned source.
The traffic light was recently mounted in front of the Sea Pie in the center of Suceve, but passersby do not seem to care more about it than the information received seems to be of no account.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" was doing his job properly and someone was finding himself responsible enough to give him the right to close the work, then he would never have come to this absurd situation.
The head of the Strazi Management and Systematization Service Route of the Suceava Mayor recognized it as being the girl when the traffic light began to work, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We gave them in use, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"Even I was in the front when they were put into operation," said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be corrected as soon as possible.
Thank God it can be remedied, because there are situations in which "Dorel" has made irreparable damage.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Ruse gas pipeline, "Dorel" missed the drilling mill that dug the tunnel under the Dunare, it is not known where, probably under the ground, buried, was not found anyway, after even sustained the Minister of Economy, Mihai Tutose.
Police put the water cannons on immigrants.
On the main Hungarian border with Serbia Hungarian granizers used, Wednesday, cannons with water and tear gas against immigrants.
Although Hungary closed the border with a stringed sarma fence and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, on the Sarbo-Ungara border continued to gather refugees, The Guardian writes.
The water cannons were put in operation when the immigrants managed to patrol through the salt fence by crossing the Roszke border.
The Hungarian police support that gunfire action was a control measure of the crowd, throwing water bottles.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people tearing, after the use of tear gas.
At the same time, the publication Elena Enikos wrote that two German companies refused to deliver the flavor of Hungary.
Tara has already raised the fence to the border with Serbia and Tuesday has announced her intention to raise one and to the border with Romania, a strongly criticised initiative in Bucharest.
The German companies argue that the salt salt is very dangerous and causes cuttings that can be infected.
It is used to secure prisoners or military installations, but should not be used against people who seek shelter, support companies.
In parallel with the Hungarian border confrontations, Croatia has mobilized to provide immigrants with buses to transport those on the border to the country with Serbia.
Croatian Interior Ministry confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, of which 73 children, further showed the Ministry.
Tsipras, about Greece's drama - why he agrees with the third EU agreement
The declared aim of the former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from more and more austerity and to fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels.
Finally, the leader of Syriza made part of a third loan agreement in Greece for this country, which also involves many years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which conducts an interview with this country.
Now, however, Tsipras asks the Greeks to re-entrust the prime minister's mandate, in a number of choices which he claims will undermine his political position.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the dismemberment of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring debt for Greece remains open," the former Prime Minister said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have ended in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the financing part of the agreement represents a great success for the Greek government, showing that all the financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says that Greece "certainly needs reforms", stating that it must begin with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections in September after 7 stormy months at the head of the Athens Executive, the period when a third loan rescue loan was approved for Greece.

They're caught in sight with the Western machine gun.
Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar of Assad has given a rare interview to the Russian press, in which he speaks about refugees and accuses the West as supporting terrorists and "he's in sight" of immigrants.
"The West mourns for them and the West sustains terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when he said this is a peaceful revolt," Assad said, in an interview with Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus claims that his Western counterparts say about the situation in Syria that it is terrorism like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or Syrian regime or Syrian president".
As long as this propaganda follows, there will be more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept them or hugged them as refugees, it's about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, stop supporting terrorists.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of the whole refugee issue," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued the accusations to Western States and the treatment they showed to refugees.
It's like the West now cries for refugees with one eye and takes them in sight with the second eye machine gun, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, primarily because of terrorists and crimes and secondly because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and destroy the infrastructure, you will not have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to win their existence somewhere in this world," Bashar says Assad.
"If I were asking any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding as the political forces, whether inside or outside the government, "we should join around what the Syrian people want."
The president of Syria is of the opinion that his country's dialogue should continue "to reach consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless we break terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to ask all forces to join forces against terrorism, because it is how we can achieve the political goals that we, as Syrians, want through dialogue and political action," Bashar of Assad said.
He also spoke of one of his country's allies, Russian president Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, he was transformed, from the friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West again for falsifying reality in both cases.
Note what happened in the Western press after the hit in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a Tar.
It is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses the Russian Opposition and who has come to power through non-democratic means, despite the fact that he was elected in democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, I'm not democratic anymore.
"This is Western propaganda," Damasc's leader scored.
Not least, it included Russia on the list of friends - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, alongside Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
On the other hand, Bashar of Assad criticized Turkey, another neighbour country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, about which he said "I can't even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, Syria's president accuses the "international coalition", led by the United States, who fights terrorism: "In fact, since this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State began to expand."
In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries providing cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight against terrorism.
You can't be against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, you will get caught - then we have no object in cooperating with all these countries, considering that it is a real and not false coalition, that fights terrorism," said the leader of Damascus.
Autumn?
Not at all.

Map of the countries with the biggest cheaps and how to stay Romania
The collapse of the oil quota has caused major losses in the last year of workers in the extraction of the title, of the shareholders of the energy companies and of the countries that are heavily dependent on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: gasoline has been very cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, from October 2014 to July 2015, in almost all 76 countries taken into account, the price of fuel has fallen.
The most important price reduction in the pump is observed in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine has cost 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs with less than one dollar.
The opposite pole was Saudi Arabia, where the price is kept fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the conditions of refining, the changes in taxation, and the fluctuations in the currency course.
For a more exact comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price of every state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
Bloomberg data shows that, in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (about 3.8 liters) was $5.49.
Thus, we ranked the 27th place on the edge of the countries with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The last quarter of 2014, gas was also cheap for the Romans.
Then, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a 10.6% price reduction.
Even so, the countries around are even better off.
In Bulgaria, one gallon of gasoline costs $4.92, and in Hungary - $5.20.
Immigrants are setting up the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised, on Tuesday night, that the federal government will give additional support to the 16 landfills of the federation in the reception and distribution of tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a nearly four-hour meeting with prime ministers in the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to face the large number of refugees," notes the DPA agency.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals as well as distribution centers.
"These pivot points are necessary," she stressed.
The whole country must provide a massive impulse to face the crisis, added Merkel.
The Prime Ministers asked for more help than the €6 billion agreed by the ruling coalition at the federal level more than a week ago.
Prime Minister Turingiei Bodo Ramelow of the Stanga Party requested a "lowly double, and for commitments, be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister of the Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into the German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also requested that bureaucracy in handling refugees and migrants be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the processing in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
The Prime Minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer has expressed similar feelings.
Until now, Bavaria bears the hardest burden, with most migrants arriving after passing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a powerful actor on the federal scene as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual door policy opened early in the month, DPA recalls.
Mircea Lucescu makes scandal after humiliating offense with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nerve car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahthior Donek lost by 0-4.
The Roman coach showed himself totally disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahthior lost intrusion was disfavored.
Before the game I said one thing, I wish I was respected.
Unfortunately, in the games with major teams in Europe we are always underprivileged by arbitration.
There are two different ways.
We were given a yellow cardboard immediately, while the top teams were not.
Besides, the first penalty wasn't in any case!
The ball hit Darijo in the back, without touching his hand.
A game too level should not have been influenced by arbitration.
"Regret that arbitration broke the game," said Mircea Lucescu at the press conference.
"Ma'am, but what smells so ugly here"?
There were pieces of the cut husband
A murder of a common sadism terrified the inhabitants of Târgu Beautiful and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hours of the day, the markets in Târgu Frumos could see terrifying scenes near the main market entrance.
Along with the three graves, the criminals "assembled" in pieces what seemed to be a man's body.
He was cut off, but he was missing his head, internal organs, and genitals.
In the end, it would prove that it was the body of a former officer, who had been handed over by his wife, a professor of geography.
"Jași's day" has been talking to the hives even with the cab driver who helped the killer, without knowing, to the bag of bags with the dead body.
His stories make your hair ass.
The one who alerted the police yesterday about the fact that a woman whose three bags were horrifying, after pieces of the body had been found on the market, was a taxi driver from Târgu Frumos.
As in American films, the man helped himself to transport bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, without knowing it, being the killer's client for a race.
The taxi driver told, exclusively for "Jași's Day", the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide the evidence.
He carried with his hands the bags in which the body pieces of the husband of the geography teacher were found.
She had come to Târgu Beautiful to hide the evidence of the crime, as far away from her home as Roman.
Maybe she has mine.
I didn't have how you know.
Nea Mihai, as he is known to his friends who practice taximetry in Târgu Beautiful, has become a star overnight in the little town he lives in.
He's seen American films throughout his life, but he never thought he'd ever get to be himself the one who will stand at the bottom of the discovery of a sadistic crime, and he'll see with his eyes pieces of bodies.
It tells that, on the night of Monday to Tuesday, it usually expects the arrival of buses that regularly transit the town.
It is close to the intersection of the roads to Roman and to Pascans.
The cabimeter tells that the killer woman observed in the rearview mirror, next to the bags with the body pieces supported by the indicator that showed the nearby locations.
She came in the night with the Massaro race from 1.30.
The bus left it ten meters away from passing the pedestrians from the Pascans, right on the bench where it displays the mileage.
The bags were stuffed with the signboard.
After the bus left, I gave the march ten meters up to it.
I opened the trunk and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Madam, what does that smell so ugly here?".
I saw she was an old woman, and I told her to help her.
I thought she was bringing meat to the market, getting rid of it, maybe she's mine, I had nowhere to know.
I've thought maybe he'd want to suck someone with that smelly ugly meat.
She was trying to pick up a bag alone, and I resisted to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He told me to take her to the big market gate when I took her from the bus," Mihai started telling.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He added that the woman didn't say anything at all, and therefore he wasn't interested in asking her anything anymore.
To my destination, I didn't talk about anything, because I was nervous that he put my thief in the car.
And when he pulled the bags out of the car, I noticed that he smells even worse.
She took the bags out of the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I took two meters back to get back, and I realized I can't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and moved the car over and over here, to disappear the scent.
I didn't notice by the bus if someone had been helped down the bag, because we had lights in the back and we didn't see well in the mirror.
"There were two plastic bags and one rafia," the man completed.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, she says she's starting to touch her curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something wasn't right.
After he gave his bags down, I went to the hospital, to the city hall, and when I got back, I looked special to see what the woman is doing with the luggage.
She used to bring in the baggage after the fence, where are the graves inside the market.
Then I left again.
There was little agitation, because there was a microbus from Italy and a bus.
I saw the woman go to their drivers to get in, disappear, but the drivers probably didn't want to take it, because they have international races, and they don't take passengers on occasion.
The woman was very agitated, she was walking back and forth.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, out of curiosity, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee answered that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where she was patrolling the police because I had seen her a while back.
I looked for them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and told them it was something suspicious.
"Then I went somewhere else, a race to Belcești," Mihai filled out.
He also told us that the woman had become agitated after she left the luggage in the graves.
To me, suspicion left from the fact that the luggage was missing, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and they showed her to me, telling her that I noticed she had a suspect luggage.
Then the woman went to the graves and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to the place where he hid the bags around 3:00 when I gave statements to the police and prosecutors on the spot," he ended his taxi service.
The prosecutors in Neamț, who are investigating the case, say that 64-year-old teacher Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the cameras of a gas station in Roman at 0.55, going up with the three bags in the bus.
She got to Târgu Beautiful at 1.30.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, and then locked him in the house.
The man was called Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday night, the woman put the body pieces in two plastic bags, which she carried to the bus stop, and hid them.
Last night, he carried one more, then decided which way to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iasi.
Last night, the prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid the husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But the head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, in a shed in the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, the prosecutors didn't find out from the woman who was the reason why she killed her husband with so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be psychically trained, and the body will be examined by legal doctors, to officially determine the cause of death and possible other relevant details.
The municipality took over the national roads at the municipal level, after years ago they had been taken by the Government, so that it could be suffocated with money from the national budget, in the 2004 election campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and a decision by the Government is required to be applied.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a demeanor because it was in the establishment to give the opinion for the Plan Ur banistic general (PUG).
The city took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any event, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 obliges the municipality to take the national roads that pass through the municipality.
No opinion can be issued from the National Roads if the law is not complied with, so it was necessary to approve this.
The national roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, the government's decision will have to be issued and decided as a result of this decision of the Local Council," said the interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The national roads that divide the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The National Road 28 hits the Iașul on the arteries: the road Păcurari, the road Munteni (to be made), the Moara de Foc, the Strapungea Silvestru, the street Silvestru, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. Springs, the road Chisinau, the road Túțora until the exit from the municipality to Tomești - Albița.
The other national road, DN 24, includes Bucium road, bd. Socola (up to traffic light), Buccium street (up to base 3), Chisinau road, Tudor Vladimirescu, C.A. Rosetti and exit to Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Following the description of files in the "file" of Mircea Eliade's political sympathies of youth, which, as far as condensate, would have presented too much the size of a daily article and should be broadcast in the series, deserves, I believe, evoked the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most veheant charges used by the detractors of the great Romanian scholar.
A less humorous description would be, I hope, useful in the real debate that the recent "antilegiate" law would be appropriate to spark it in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analyzing the diverse versions of Eliade in the Legion by means of the "Axa" Cuibulum and Radu Gyr, Florin Turcanu brings to the fore in the volume Mircea Eliase.
The prisoner of history (București, 2003), another hypothesis, which interests us in the highest degree in the understanding of the resumption of the epistular contacts between Radu Gyr and Elias in 1968, after playing Ceaușescu "scene of the balcony" that August.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the safety investigation, in 1941, documents stored today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) as well as a tracking note from 1938, Florin Turcanu said that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in the so-called "Legal Family" called Luminita, a group of "cuiburi" of intellectuals, especially writers, led by poet Radu Gyr".
Since there is no verifiable data on the Earth's nest, those in exile considering the existence of this debatable "leginaire family", what needs to be discussed is, after all, the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving to a surprising part of the SRI to make available these secret dossiers to Mr.Turcanu, it is more than clear that at that time the goal of the security pursuit was “Commander” Radu Gyr, mentioning Eliade, in accordance with the note of 21 March 1938, in the context where Armand Cálinescu, the Minister of Internal Affairs took the free hand to take all necessary steps to ensure that King Carol could enforce his royal dictatorship, suspending his parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the legions that began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (the All Party for the Third Country was released in the 1937 elections).
The arrest of Elias was carried out following this note, quoted by Turcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, enrolled in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a thin bureaucratic cover for the repression of 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes were made at the reseal for the vast majority of legionnaires or supporters active in the public space who were to be arrested, but who were to be linked by an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's holographic statement mentioned above, given in arrest, in February 1941, after the circumvention of the legislating rebellion, only confirms retrospectively on the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any authoritarian, police regime.
It would have been interesting if Hurricane had provided more details on the content of the 573 cited file.
Was that Eliade's or Radu Gyr's completed file?
Because it must anyway be a file built on the safety documents, but then processed by security to be used or against each other.
It is here a misconception, just as in the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows the composition of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it represents a pre-emptive stage, of proof, in which the person concerned behaves as an active sympathizer, who was in the three-year period of testing before becoming "camerad" with acts in order.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as intellectual clubs or scenes, chairs, groups of conversations with peasants, youth organizations or gravitative students around a nest, were his "family", not his own nest, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances completely escapes the unanticipated reader by making Eliade's "member" status (which can be plausible) understood and used in writing to designate the political regiment in the nest.
Of course, the invocation of such subtle interpretations cannot conceal the public support of the Guard or the clear sympathy for the Captain who animated Eliade during 1935-1940, whether in Nae Ionescu's soil or not.
Public support for a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean, and the political regime itself stated as much as, as usual, intellectuals of this size retains a type of superiority in the face of the activists as such and does not go into politics unless they are given direct high privileges.
As much as I could think about Eliade's thinking of that time, when he was the "young generation leader", I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rigor from a legionary nest.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
To no longer mention, except in the past, the fact that in any legionary "file" it receives is public anti-semitic activity as well as violence, both worthy to be stigmatized, but non-existent in the case of Elias, until new evidence.
With regard to Eliade-Gyr's correspondence from 1968 to 1969, Mircea Hangoca, a lawyer of Eliase, tries to sanction Florin's claims (based on still some archival documents, even if they had deserved to be dissected and contextualized more seriously) with a questionable argument though.
Mircea Hangoca notes, in the volume Noi glosse about Mircea Eliase (București, 2006), that "not a row of correspondence between Mircea Eliase and Radu Gyr does not contain any hint at this fit".
He had no way in 1968, when he came out somewhat alive from the communist ocunas, Radu Gyr could not have risked an allusion in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think she wanted to stress is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, admiration and affection without any doubt regarding Elijah's ancestry.
There really is no paleest suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been the head of Elias.
Intelligent, the poet obliged to write to the Glass of the Father, devotes from the head of the place the embarrassing condition signaling to Elias (who knew exactly what the mission had that publication that was constantly dealing with the denigration of the right exile), in the signature, after "your old friend", to what to expect and is visible light and happy when it responds to them affectionately after almost three decades of separation from the "viclean time" has alienated them.
There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" with which he had been assigned (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could come back quiet at least to see his mother and friends) and that, skilledly, he fulfills it dry and through short sentences, separated from paragraphs, to suggest their character of foreign body, Radu Gyr shows his interest only for literature.
No talk of ezoteric allusions, refined political complicities suggested or any evocation of young people in a register other than cultural.
It's hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior on Eliade's legion line, but until the consolidation of this version with less circumstantial evidence than those offered by Florin Turcanu, we have in this correspondent memories that testify a reciprocal price of characters that have marked different, but statorical, our culture and that, beyond the extreme trials of life, find the tone of civilization and interbilicate education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not, instructing for the force of friendship and mutual respect beyond the destiny of the authors.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eliade finally gave up his refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext of health problems and catastrophic flooding in the country, announced the RSR authorities, through the embassy (which had a sporadic correspondence used to obtain his sister's passport), that he could not take the course of the invitation to return to the country.
The following was predictable: it is again put on the index, it is mounted in Israel "the Tolladot deal", the books sent to family and friends (Fragments d'un journal, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped from censorship, never see their mother again.
Of friends in the country only with Noica still has a sporadic correspondence although, surprisingly, as a personal archive from Chicago attests, a lot of private people or Romanian institutions are more able to send them messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr no longer got permission to write to him after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceausescu regime tried Eliade's second operation (through official invitations, Noica's movements, translations etc.) Radu Gyr had already gone through forever.
New coach, foreign player
Due to the shortage of native volleyballists, Penicilina Iasi tests in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Excursions are taking part in training tournaments under coach Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year of the A1 Division of female flight, Penicillina Iași kept its place in the first step due to the withdrawal and then to the destruction of the Miroslava Science band, newly promoted in the first estalon following a dam tournament even disputed in the outgoing municipality.
The news took a little on the unprepared management of the group eessen, which woke up without the main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, arrived second in Bacău Science) and many missing players, some retreats such as Cristina Lungu and the free Diana Studneanu, or gone, as Ana-Maria Berdilla (at the champion of the Volei Alba Blaj) and Sisters Maria and Iuliana Fica.
Of course, until the scheduled 10 October championship was resumed, there was also time for the batch to be completed.
First was found a new coach in Dan Gavril's person, from the male team LPS Piatra Neamț and who has worked little in the last few years at Penicilina, he soon feels like signing a contract with the group led by the left Vasile.
Then two players from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconița were brought, and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland were tried, closer to transfer being the poor player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrinca Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Peniciline lot led by Dan Gavril made a canton at Gura Humorului, after which he took part in a tour held at Lugoj and equipped with the Banatului Cup, where the students made a win (3-0 with Cluj University), but suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, from 23 to 25 September, Penicillina will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship, we're trying to make up a valuable team.
We have a successful and experienced coach, but Romania's player fund is quite low and that is why we will also call on volleyballists from abroad, especially after the decision was made that the teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the younger generation of sports from clubs in Romania.
"We were hoping to get to the end of the competitive year in the 5-6 places, even if it would be very hard," said the left Vasile, president of ACS Penicilina Iași.
Thrilled meeting.
Twins gathered after nearly 70 years
The 69-year-old Gemmen George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski were born at the end of World War II in Germany after their Polish mother had barely been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too sick to care for them, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, so the two brothers were separated not only from the one who gave them life, but from the other.
Decades ago George and Lucian didn't know one about each other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered the documents that showed that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the '60s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they found no trace of him leading to Lucian.
Only in 2015, thanks to the program , Restoring Family Links" of the Red Cross, the twins met again, and the moment was one more than exciting.
BBC reporters surprised this episode.
Ten kids from Iași brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal were won by the kids from the German Open Championship at Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organized by the German Federation of Dans Sportiv and the World Federation of Dans Sportiv.
In Iași, five pairs took part in the Dance Energy Club and danced with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 children in the country participated in five different categories (youths 1, June 2, Youth 2, Youth and Amateurs).
Those who returned home with medals were the pairs: Răzvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Tarzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Stefana Gologan (bronz medal).
And three other pairs managed to occupy leading places: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Iosub Cujbe and not least the pair Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionița.
As a coach I wanted to confirm the results achieved in March of this year, this reconfirmation is necessary for both us and sportsmen as regards their future evolution.
The fact that we managed to hear Romania's anthem twice this year at the German Open and to return home with four medals, we enjoy our enormous joys and give us hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to a higher level.
"All these could only be achieved with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andreea Ramona Manolache, coach of the Dance Energy Club children.
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, obtaining a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country for 4 out of the 20 participating countries.
Note that of the nine medals, four came to Iaşi.
6 methods to get rid of stress in a minute
Too few of us allow us to run off a mountain weekend to escape stress.
Some take time, others finance, and both obstacles.
But there are solutions to anyone who wants to escape a little stress.
They do not imply any high costs or special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
The day-to-day cares are inevitable, but it depends on how we make them face and what attitude we take from them.
Instead of machining you inside and feeling like an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the following relaxation tactics that don't steal more than a minute.
Deep Breathe
Breathing exercises are not intended only for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for any man in part, and regulating breathing in a tense moment helps to release endorphins in the body, which leads to a state of relaxation, informs Livestrong.
Be a child
We know we're past the age of childhood and we're not allowed to join when we're in a hurry.
But that doesn't mean we can't go to the corner of the office building or anywhere we know we're alone (even behind the building) and we can't type as much as our fans do.
You can get rid of the nerve and the negative energy accumulated over a day with a few storms.
Imagine a nice place
We know that the recommendation was worthy of a replication during a psychotherapy session, but it's not that psychologists often use it.
Imagining a beautiful place, which inspires us calm and detasing the daily frenzy, can lead to the attenuation of the nerve state.
It's really about self-resuscitation, a process that can even change lives, both in good and in bad.
Everything depends on what we're suggesting.
It's best to think of a very idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Put your castles in your ears and listen to the relaxing music.
Attention, it's not about the favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal, you might find it hard to relax.
Listen to even the relaxation songs, which are lined and do not contain verses, to restore the balance when you are lit up.
Decojiti o orange
Does it sound strange the advice to decoy an orange to nerve?
Well, it's not!
Because it is not about fruit itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occasional, too total).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of orange shell, during decoys, stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, hormone of well-being.
Eat an animal
Those who have animals close by, whether it's the one at home, whether it's the one who has decided to go to the place of work, take a few seconds to handle it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal management may lower blood pressure.
time and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with instruments are somewhat rival, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces from the Roman folklore combining violin with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is called WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found ourselves, and from that moment it made us very much pleasure to sing together, having a practically unlimited repertoire."
We thought this was the time for a guitar violin.
Cristi: "From the first meeting we realized that very well what we sing and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work."
Each of us has learned from each other's repertoire, and what is very important is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there's a cliff between classical music and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And secondly, we were stealing a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who only listen to classical music listen to and rock, and those who only listen to rock to get to play and classical music.
And we were surprised to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to something like that and they'd love it.
Christi: "When we find young people - and we find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, it seems formidable."
The students in Iași stayed in traffic more than at school on the first day after vacation
Hundreds of rabbits were "captives" yesterday morning in hell traffic in several areas.
The municipality announced that the Mangeron Boulevard (the Bay of the Far Left) is now closed between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș.
The mayors of the city failed to comply with their promises to carry out works for the smoothing of traffic with the beginning of the school year.
One of the assurances that the municipality has given them, at least twice over the past few weeks, has noticed the re-establishment of the tour in the International Guard area.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be set up, and the last time the work was done last week, yesterday the tour was not carried out.
The nerves of the drivers were laid to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another promise of the city was violated: the move of customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Technopolis "at the late end of August", in the context in which this transfer has been discussed since 2012.
Currently, the interim mayor Mihai Chirica says the problem at the International Station is more complicated.
The tour will be done at the right time, we need to take into account the traffic of the trams in the area, an opinion must also be given at the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tram to stay on the turn, but we'll solve it in a way," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to him, would be to stop the tram with a traffic light before turning.
Traffic problems were also in the intersection of the Red Bridge.
The car tail on St. Lazar's street extended to the SRI headquarters.
"I've been waiting for good minutes to get out in the Red Pod," said one exiter.
By Podu Roș they were due in September to travel to CUG, if the rehabilitation project "South functional artery development and rehabilitation" was completed within the initial execution (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the original one.
"I drew European funds for new works, e.g. overlength, on the initial version of Nicolina passage was narrow," said Chirica.
The most recent deadline for the reintroduction of the traffic of the trams is October.
During the course of yesterday, the tourists signaled traffic problems especially in areas such as Paccurari, Centro (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Road Armeana) or the intersection of Base 3.
The Armenians could return as chief at the CJ.
In the days of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The Judges of the Court will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the Judicial Council will maintain judicial control and prohibitions.
The Judges of the Iasi Court resolved a new deadline yesterday in the "Album" file, in which the defendant is also the suspended president of the Iasi County Council.
At the end of yesterday's sitting, the magistrates decided to pronounce themselves in the course of tomorrow's day on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against Armenia.
The latter wishes to inhabit or revoke this measure, which has kept it away from the head chair of the JC for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is maintained by the higher court, Cristian Amantia will be able to resume his role as President of the CJ.
The Armenians were sued by the National Directorate Anti-Corruption (DNA), being accused of favoring the perpetrator and false intellectuals after, I say pro curatoria, they would have tried to mask an audit control after which a series of irregularities were discovered regarding the reception of a signed public contract between CJ and the company Laser Co.
The Armenians would have tried to hide that the institution that led would not have received more material to promote Iaşi, although scripturally these figures as received by CJ.
Along with him were the courts and three directors of the CJ, but also the managing director of Laser Co.
Another 3,500 are expected to vote until September 25th.
The municipality is prepared to distribute other questions, if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
They have only ten days left to express their opinion on the replanting of the tea on the pedestrian Stephen the Great.
According to municipal officials, about 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed at the district centres and three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Esplanda Alexandru the Good and the City Hall) have been completed so far.
A record number of rabbits appeared on Sunday in front of the City Hall.
According to the representatives of the civic group "Iașul loves teas", 530 people voted in 140 minutes, almost four votes cast each minute.
On the other hand, throughout the course of the month, about 440 people have come to the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many out-of-the-sheep advertising and people are finding public consultation ineffective.
They therefore made an appeal yesterday to internet users to print an information display made available by the group and to paste it in the block stairs.
Volunteers also showed that at the additional point in Copou park, the last formulations were completed by e-mails on Sunday.
We'll provide formulation from the neighborhood centers, where it doesn't really complete.
"Perhaps additions will be made when all 12,000 formulations will be completed," the municipality's spokesman Sebastian Buraga said yesterday.
The "Null Thing Scruts" will end on September 25, and if the majority vote of the exits is in favour of replanting the trees then the Prime Minister will plant your silver in this fall.
The Iesei may express their opinion at the district centres in Dacia, Frumosa, Tâtarași, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as at the additional points mentioned above.
The mayors decided to cut the teas from Stephen the Great at the beginning of 2013, which brought a fine of 60,000 lei of the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without a consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civic group "Iash loves tea", an online community of about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for tea replanting was signed by more than 9100 supporters until yesterday evening.
RECORD of students enrolled in USAMV Iasi!
It's 920 in the year I
The University has this year 920 students in the year I.
Representatives of the University of Science Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" said this year were the most successful candidates ever admitted, from the history of the institution of higher education, from the establishment.
We are very pleased with the results of this year's admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates in university history, almost 920 students in the year I. We never exceeded such a number.
"We've also had higher average candidates, we've taken over the budget seats at the license and master," said Professor Ioan Tenu, director responsible for teaching.
It further noted that the university has also registered a considerable number of students at tax, taking up 20% of those places, a significantly higher figure than in other years.
Although the results have also been published in the Romanian language study lines, the continued admission to the English study programme at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which has removed 50 seats, where the fee is 5,000 euros, and is now expected to be answered by the ministry regarding the confirmation of the students' and the study visas required.
At the autumn session, a total of 120 files were filed on the 14 budgeted places and 209 were taken to competition in the "tax" scheme in the licensing studies.
Most of the files were filed at the Faculty of Agriculture, 75, at the Horticulture, 23 and at Zoothehnie, 22.
At the master's session, 18 files were placed on the 150 tax seats proposed by USAMV, seven of them in Agriculture, five in Horticulture and six in Zoothehnie.
Drivers are afraid to enter the wheels of cars in the cracks on the Tudor Vladimirescu Bridge
The bridge over Bahulus on the Tudor Vladimirescu Boulevard was as full of fun as when the "Jașiary of Iasi" wrote about the problems they presented ten days ago.
Our daily reporter then signaled that on the axis delimiting the two directions of walking the asphalt was left, defending the deep corners, some even 20 centimeters, through which concrete plates that represent the main infrastructure of the bridge.
The asphalt also began to crack on the one side and on the other side of the axis, pre-demanding signs that the depth will increase.
At that time, the interim mayor Mihai Chirica states that the bridge has no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise, with a view to starting a project to rehabilitate the bridge and the tramway, worth 5 million euros.
Mayor Chirica states that the area affected by cracks and groups will be signalled, and asphalt restoration works will be carried out quickly.
However, the only measures taken so far have been the setting up of populace and a signaling band, without even making a simple lead.
During this period, we have focused more on opening the school and the work needed for this purpose.
"There's a point expertise for the bridge that we're waiting for in about a week with the details needed for the intervention, I appreciate that in no more than two weeks we can move on to remedy the situation," said the interim mayor.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
Preparatory class, how he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know whether to enjoy or let myself get sick of melancholy; tilt, passive, to the second variant.
First, because I feel like it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took him for the first time, with emotions, to the garden.
Though breath is light, no normal parent is happy to grow children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then a story that, at the top, didn't end until today.
I wasn't even what is usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But I always liked school.
So much so that I chose to continue to frequent it, even as a teacher.
When I decided that's what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And no one with some stake.
That's because, like every one of us, I've given up all the kinds of teachers: better or worse, nicer or insufferable, smarter or just imbecile.
Unfortunately, there are people with other calls in this bracelet.
I think they're toxic, because they hurt enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I had the chance to give, while I was a student or a student, over a few, few, exceptions.
These meetings can be decisive if they happen at the right time.
Who believes that the role of the cathedral is trivial transmission of information is annoyance.
That's what anyone can do; informed, you can tell the student very well on your own, that we only live in the era of transparency.
A good teacher, however, molds the minds of the students.
It's forming them, it's yapping their thinking.
Sitting in the chair is not a privilege, as I think enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very moftrous, demanding, unforgivative and always willing to look for the fairs of their faces.
That's how they say age, temperament.
In adolescence, we all thought we knew everything, that we had doubts about anything.
When we grow up, we come to understand that we have only doubts.
That's why a teacher's role is to get the teenager out of his self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, he's starting to doubt himself, he's asking questions.
To discover on their own the answers, whether they or the suppliers.
Get involved in everything he does.
To turn it discreetly to profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially that most of the time the student thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One who barely waits to catch him on the wrong foot to sanction him.
But that makes him, the pure, uncomprehensive, rebellious person, who owes himself to live full of the calls of age, to look at the one from the chair with suspicion.
He just doesn't have a natural way to accept his attempt to order it.
Teenagers are not allowed to set up, they do not agree to be restricted.
Or, if I give the impression that I do, they get revenge.
And, unfortunately, when in the chair there is a rigid person, who is imposed by harshness and does not communicate, the students get revenge on the object taught.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with great writers, for example, because of the lack of the Romanian teacher's touch.
There are thousands of such students who feel that history is a sharing of data, that mathematics is all that can be more obnoxious to their unsightly mind.
I always urge my students: if you give up a teacher you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him remove you from the literature to which you should go.
How did it happen that I became the teacher myself?
I had a very good teacher in VI-VIII.
He opened my mind to some texts that spoke to the puberty ever since on his understanding.
I've met a university professor who opened the door to his library in high school.
I was looking at him as a man from another world: he had the walls of the house covered with embroidered shelves of books.
I was losing myself in his library and I was dreaming of having one the same.
Now I may have it, but if I didn't get it in my way, maybe I would have decided to become a footballer.
Or engineer or lawyer or who else knows what.
I don't think such encounters are random.
I don't believe in Hazard.
Essentially, you're going to get over the man who takes you by the hand and patiently turn you to his own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me just talk about what it means to teach literature.
It's just that literature can't be handed over.
There is no professor of literature, as there is a professor of mathematics.
How do you stick to the ineffable concept?
You can, at most, approach him, without claiming to convey stoned truths.
The one in the chair can at most guide the reading, that's something else.
But especially it can take some miraculous encounters between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, which can lift him up, about someone, the eyelines.
Therefore, the professor of literature must first of all be able to make his students understand (to feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great cosseur, Al. Paleologu, says one thing only apparently paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not vice versa!" and he was right.
That's why a good teacher prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Fortunately, we always have something to learn.
And we, teachers; or especially us, teachers.
Most of the time, it only repeats from inertia a great truth: not only the disciples have to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a master, and the student a student.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A few of them find him, he's right.
But the master was the one who lit the spark.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a pure blood teacher than to endure as many such breakups.

If FIFA is extended
Justice in the United States and Switzerland will proceed to new arrests
American and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal prosecutions will begin in the case of new persons and organisations, in the FIFA corruption investigation, inform the international press.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced, Monday, at a press conference held in Zürich, that the area of investigations into global football corruption was enlarged.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will engage additional prosecutions to new individuals and organizations," Lynch said.
In May, more FIFA leaders were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extradited to the United States.
"We have hopes that other people who are being criminalized will arrive in the U.S.," added Lynch.
Switzerland's Attorney General, Michael Lauber, also at the press conference, said his institution had seized several goods, including houses and lands in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the investigation carried out in collaboration with the USA.
"I didn't even get to the end of the first arrest," Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information, 11 terabytes, has been confiscated.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are investigated.
The investigators also entered into a media rights agreement in the 2010 World Cups in South Africa and in 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a major scandal of corruption, after American justice accused 14 people, including two FIFA Vice-Presidents and seven forum officials.
Persons held are researched for mitigating and receiving other benefits, from the early 1990s and until now, totalling more than $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced in early July that he was resigning from the office of FIFA president, after being re-elected for the fifth time.
Beats like movies at the theater
In Milan's Supekombat Gala, the ex-Catalin Moroșanu will fight the "beast" James Wilson
A number of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Catalin Moroșanu, will participate, on October 2, at the Superkombat Gala at the 4 Ciak Linear Theatre in Milan, the last before the final in November, is shown in a release MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as we promised, we will return this fall with a new five-star gal.
If we've still chosen an unpublished venue, a theater, then we promise to fight like in the movies.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters in the event schedule.
In addition to the games with the already consecrated stars, we will have another gal in the opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, among which the Romanians Cristi Spetcu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"The full program will soon be announced," said promoter Eduard Irimia.
Catalin Moroșanu will fight in the Galle Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination with American James Wilson, known after 2012 participated in the last pyramid in the heavy category organized in Japan and the numerous awards from the concussions of bodybuilding.
I'm just waiting to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm tearing him down!
I'm still mad that last year I couldn't fight at the end, so now I'm gonna get revenge on him.
"From the beast turns him into a cat," said Moroshanu.
Undefeated in 2015, the Andrei and Bogdan Stoica brothers will have in Italy the last confrontations before they fight for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, both of them were shot through KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm glad I'm back in Italy, last year's atmosphere was incredible.
"I can't wait to meet with the fans there and promise them a new surprise show," said the world champion Andrei Stoica.
In Milan he will also fight Raul Cătinaş with an opponent to be established.
A little girl invited the queen of England to her day, but argued in her letter.
A young girl from Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for her longest reign, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to Buckingham Palace when she went to visit him with her family.
The letter was not echoed, but the girl received an answer from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for the invitation, but also apologized for not being able to be present on September 27, but she even hated having fun with family and friends.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited to a talkshow shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died from the heart.
The fate of Adrian Păunescu and Vadim Tudor is similar.
Both of them were writers and politicians and both of them had died at close ages of heart.
Adrian Păunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died on a TV reality show.
Full of verb, Vadim Tudor ironized Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, the Minister of Tourism from that time, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor said, with a funny smile, to Adrian Păunescu: "I'm envious of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
He said, "It's not too flattering what you told me now."
Adrian Păunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died today, 14 September 2015, at the age of 65.

A Syrian artist turned "Super Mario" into a refugee
A Syrian artist created a version with refugees of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the plight of his countrymen, on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Citrus, the modified video game has downtown the "Mio Refugee".
The character is trying to get past human traffickers and border police on its way to a European Union refugee centre.
The artist set up in Istanbul uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and said he made the video game with refuge Mario after his friends ventured on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of war.
At the Craiova detention center the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I
Justice Minister Robert Casanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Center, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I, and the oldest is 25 years old and is in class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a center belonging to the National Penitentiary Administration to try to draw attention, and thus, to lesser-known realities.
The youngest 15-year-old student is enrolled in Class I, and the oldest is 25 years old and enrolled in Class XI.
"There are complicated subjects that society is concerned to discuss at this time, we are all pressed by our own worries and problems, but we must not go through with the lesson that these more than 100 young people in the Craiova Detention Center offer," said Minister Robert Casanciuc on Monday at the school year's opening festival.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by lack of material possibilities, can lead to tragedies, stating that young people in this centre would have another chance in life if they could have followed the school course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read but also to get a set of moral values, find out what it means to respect the law and what consequences it can have.
"The role of the prison system is not to permanently isolate people from society who have violated the law, to close them behind high walls, but to try to restore them and prepare them, so that when they return to the community they will have more chances of reintegration," said Casanciuc.
The Minister stated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system, because in many cases the conditions of detention are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and thanks to this partnership, every year, in the prison system, there are more than 2000 graduates of school education.
Obviously, we won't be able to change overnight that hasn't been done 25 years, but there are important steps we're taking.
"In all these moves we also need the support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and are no danger to society," said Casanciuc.
The Minister of Justice has hated the success of both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the conjugal effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the Holy Cross, I would launch all students and teachers the invitation to visit the mausoleums of the Soviet, Mother and not only, to understand what it means to young people for ideals," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to the vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be destroyed!
Request for prestigious universities in Iasi and the country
Over 200 researchers, universities, personalities and students in the country have signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academic Society requesting the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even to disband the Romanian doctoral schools "which allow and promote academic taxation".
Among the signatures of the petition launched on 10 September are teaching frameworks and teachers in Iasi.
Among the university signatories of the petition in the academic environment is, for example, Professor Liviu Antonesee.
At the national level, the petition has names from former ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miclea, to people of culture who are also academic academic frameworks, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Law of Education provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been carried out so far, thus determining the lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools that flagrantly violate ethical rules in scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance", the application states.
That petition specifically requires compliance with the Law of National Education, assessment of doctoral schools, suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school in which more than two plagiarisms have been found, until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school where there is no minimum number of doctoral conductors provided for by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Scientific Research Council in 2011 for eligibility for grants of projects of type IDEI.
Do you respect less a general without a doctorate, or a politician, or an information agent in the Middle East?
"Why does there not exist in Europe other academies that are organized by secret services, and the top military that give their doctorate do it to autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academy Society, initiator of the petition, originating from Iasi.
This can be completed by all applicants on the Society’s Internet page, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organization to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "For Iasi" party, founded by young political unaffiliated IT managers, was launched yesterday in Copou Park.
The chairman of the "For Iasi" Initiative Group gave an interview "Jași Journal"
Iaşul will have a party dedicated exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of political unaffiliated entrepreneurs and managers so far launched at the end of last week the Party for Iasi, which will propose candidates for local elections in 2016.
Currently, the party's core is made up of IT specialists, but training initiators say that all people who want to get involved in modernising the city are welcome in the organization.
The launch took place on Saturday in Copou Park, and at the event more than 200 supporters were involved, almost all of them young.
The special guest of the action was Nicușor Dan, president of the Association Save Bucharest.
He was the surprise of the local elections in 2012, when, from the independent position, he managed to collect 10% of the votes of the joys for the mayor of the Capital.
"People I've seen at "For Iasi" think they're very good at accessing Iash's public administration."
I believe in this initiative, I think it has a chance, I think it may have more chances in a community than in Bucharest.
"I'll always be with "To Iasi," said Nicuchor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iasi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: Reasons are more sentimental and emotional.
I was gone on many short business trips, I also lived a year in Cluj.
I came back every time, because I felt that here's my house.
ZDI: Why have you decided now to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache: Now we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have begun to know each other for some time.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we were more timid, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various construction or charitable actions, and, somehow, things have evolved naturally and organicly and now it has happened to be the time when we came to the decision that we must involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects for the efficiency of local public administration activity!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum of information on the city's activities so that different departments, institutions and kings can work together as well.
But more importantly, we can publish transparent data on the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects etc. We are talking about information organisation.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a certain neighborhood, it is important to consult the public of the people affected.
If we speak of efficiency, we must not forget the common transport, we have the worst buses in the country.
New means of transport must be bought.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city matters extremely much.
How would you promote Iash?
Andrei Postolache:Go on the plane and look for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can "come" the city.
You need to want to do this and know how to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iashi.
What is the brand of Iash?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we have to be a city of technology in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we have to expand it, go to medicine, get into the robotics area, the 3D printing area, continue in this spirit and join these elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I'm referring here to the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Iaș already has a historical brand that must not be changed, namely the cultural city.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for lack of experience in public administration as well as the lack of traditional party structures with which elections are still being won in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, working with people and carrying out projects.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to get people involved, we'll talk to everyone, we won't just stay on Facebook, we're not online party.
We don't want to have "voluntaries" brought by the bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there are enough people that way.
ZDI: Should Iaş Mayor be more concerned with promoting the image of the city nationally and internationally, or is it necessary for the area of concern to be permanently edifying?
Andrei Postolache: One without another does not work.
First of all, you have to solve today's problems, the emergencies.
Or, if you don't make your town known, if you don't attract money in town, at some point you're out of money and you're not gonna be able to make, for example, streets.
Both must be done at the same time and people must be competent next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the mayor-tattoo model, which comes and punches the table and solves everything.
No, no.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We look for people who want to do something good, have a good reputation, be clear about integrity and be honorable.
From this point of view, we have no other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, he established the Introspecials company after, for seven years, he was the director of the Endava International Affairs (2008 - 2015), where he coordinated a team of 300 people.
Another four years (2003 - 2007) spent at Synygy.
The company that established it with another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
The tractor Rabla program turned out to be a failure
Director General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said the Program to stimulate the renewal of national tractors and agricultural machinery, initiated in 2011, also known as Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to bureaucracy.
Related to the Rabla Programme, there have been some trials in recent years, but it has proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a farmer, and the approvals were far too long and then the world has given up.
Through that program it was able to sell somewhere at 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," said Mircea Oltean.
According to him, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces a few hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that the competition is exercised by firms from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It's a great competition with those coming from outside, all the world producers have set their eyes on Romania, I know these things I told you, and they have special policies.
"At all trade fairs there is a lot of agglomeration, all producers are exposed, they come in all kinds of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who said that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
Through the Tractor Rabla program, initiated in 2011, those holding old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as the combinations, could teach them and instead receive a 17000 lei value ticket.
The red flag has been raised
The internal election of workers seems more spectacular and more political, as the new leader chosen automatically becomes his peak of launch in future elections.
Raised, therefore, the red-burned drape/ Under his skirts we will live and die.
That was what Jeremy Corbyn played yesterday in the London Sanctuary House pub.
- He's been testifying to many facts and vows. - Let's not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial British and international left (Red Flag/The Red Flag) would be able to search the internet and would not be excluded from having a surprise.
With our heads discovered, let's all swear that we'll wear it until we crash.
The author of these ranks is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and not of those who float them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn manages to join the left of yesterday's tomorrow, this love story between him and the Laburist Party base will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think it's going to happen that way, but it seems premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat over five years, of a leader chosen the other day.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have witnessed a democratic exercise of an impressive scope.
Not British Labour have invented the voting system directly for the party leader, among the western left.
A more complicated system, based on motions, which allows the expression of all members and supporters, has been in practice for a few years, and they have organized a preliminary competition for the nomination of the 2012 presidential candidate.
However, the internal election of workers seems more spectacular and more political, as the new leader chosen automatically becomes his peak of launch in future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of the political system, the customization of power being more pronounced in Britain than on the other side of the Hand Channel.
In addition, participation in the vote was high in all three "problems": members themselves, members of the unions and other organisations affiliated to the party, and finally the group of supporters (who received the ballot after a summary of the registration procedure).
This last group gives us interesting information about the perceptions of the left segments of British society, in particular those of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to engage more, in the future, just because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are, as far as I know, sociological surveys that tell us too much about the attitudes of this "external search" laborer, so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we have a lot of attitudes similar to those of the supporters Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will travel through the traditional channels of the left.
If we have to identify a vocation "anti-system", it is first reflected by rejecting the centrist line, New Labour (for many, just a dissimulated form of much-thuchcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty by the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go far enough to the left, that they were not firmly delimited by the Tony Blair era.
The second repertoire - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum for Scotland's independence.
If we abstain from the separatist message and are focused strictly on aspirations for other political themes, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of social-friendly segments of the public, animated by the ambition of equity, disarmament supporters and hostiles of military involvement across the border, but also sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
Scottish workers have thus lost an electorate to whom they should have, at least in principle, privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm towards Corbyn's campaign).
Such energy exists everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, "aristocrat" laborer.
Compared to Scotland tells us more, I believe, than the left-wing antisistema from the southern periphery of Europe.
The term "anti-system" is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week we will learn more about Jeremy Corbyn's first step as the leader of the opposition.
We will see if the red flag will not come back in the House of Commons (it would not be for the first time), after the new leader will have occupied his place, first of all the opposition banks.
However, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is primarily unity - and in this regard he even has reason to be worried.
Capable of handling with or without good science
While I wrote the article, I went over my head to check on the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" becoming the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his person "Laith Al-Saleh Jihadist" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me from the beginning circumspect).
I didn't.
In the article last week (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") we commented in parallel two photos - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean Sea and the one, in fact: the two looking at the Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh took it from the article "Syrian fighters come with the valley of refugees" (signified by Viorica Marin in the Truth of 3 September).
Monday evening, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among other things, a handle shot from the friend (not just FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscription, except a precision. Laith of Saleh is not jihadist".
On the contrary, he's a fighter against Al Assad, for democracy and those.
"So you could add and manipulate the groceries in the painting"!
I have to admit, I felt bad.
All the more as I wrote the article went through me to check the story of the former fighter on the net and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated to V. Marin's person "Laith Al-Saleh Jihadist" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - they could themselves make me from the beginning circumspect).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
On the other hand, I had no other comment on the pull of the handle from Marius Cristian than that: "I need it if I believe in the Truth"
After that, I obviously took the story for small money and I feel indebted to readers with the correct presentation of the Syrian story Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest I found it in a material by the Associated Press (Syrian rebel leader Seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader looking for Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where they noticed, among hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man trying to order in the chaos of the crowd.
The man was the Syrian tutor Laith Al Saleh in Aleppo who "is used to be in command", since he "led a unit of 700 rebels in the Syrian civil war."
We also find that Al Saleh, aged 30, had "a house, a wife and a normal life before he started the fight that cost over 250,000 lives and put on the roads a third of the Syrian population".
In the interview given to the Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh tells that "everybody wants to leave Syria."
My town is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of Islamic States) wants me, the government wants me to fight against everyone.
Besides being kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a more sinister meeting - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Now two days, I saw a sniper from government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very upset.
From the material we find out that Laith (which means a lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to the Netherlands, where he had a cousin - he was a senior officer in the Syrian army and then he became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and then bring his family - his wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly an age with the Syrian civil war, which broke out in March 2011).
After this was accomplished, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue the fight for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by the Russians), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
Crazy - whoever wants freedom has to fight against not just one enemy in Syria, but three!
I also went over a Serbian material from August 22, of which I didn't understand much, except that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists coming along with migrants: TERORISTI SE KRIJU ME,U MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/ves, in which they are joined a photo of Al Saleh with a beard holding a Syrian flag in their hand and the refugee in which they wear the shirt with "THANK YOU".
On 7 September, then, on the BBC site himself, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation using photos with the Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely claimed to show an IS figter posing as a refuge - This viral photo erroneously claims to look like a warrior of the Islamic State laying in the refuge.
We find that the picture (in fact: the pictures - the one with Laith with beard and gun and the one with THANK YOU shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have user and apologized in the meantime.
Only before that, only from his wall, the picture with the two pictures would have been washed over 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That's too late for the horse to leave!
In Romania, on 9 September, Carla Dinu from Hotnews took over the story with the BBC's manipulation, but translated the title: "A fake photo became viral shows an ISIS fighter giving himself as a refugee."
Obviously, not the photograph is false, but the interpretation was a false, wrong, short: manipulative.
