The Prague Stock Exchange at the end of the market has had a negative fall.
After the fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
Transactions in CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this down is the collapse of actions on Wall Street.
Thus, we too have shown a market reaction to the result of the vote by the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the local financial sector.
Action collapse in Asia
Tuesday the actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges have experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day subsequently cancelled some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cancelled almost 4%, but then also some of the losses stabilized to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese stock movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, dropped 3.8% while the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end the losses became 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, has dropped 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets worldwide," said the head of Hong Kong's Valute Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, so without being dependent on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries too will suffer consequences.
U.S. Action Strikes
The US Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan on Monday, for which 700 billion dollars (almost twelve billion Czech kroner) were to be allocated.
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The American actions on Monday have suffered a massacre and the main indexes of the actions have recorded the biggest collapse for over 20 years.
The Dow Jones index declined by almost 7% and a collapse of the same size was observed last time in 1987.
The index was already lowered before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the draft law was not approved, it fell free.
Congress has failed: the US government can extend $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of economic support agreement for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
American lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it's not said yet.
The representatives of Congress must, therefore, define some details of the agreement before they publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the territory of the Chamber of Representatives.
Sunday she told Reuters, the chairman of the Committee for Banking and Financial Services of Barney Frank's room.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor able to wake up the financial markets.
But then we will have a return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, to reach market aid.
Paulson: Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of presentation of the market stabilization package," Democratic Nancy Pelosi told the Bloomberg agency.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Delegates of the legislators met the night between Saturday and Sunday with the US Minister of Finance Henry Paulson, to give definitive form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire from financial companies non-conceived mortgages, which lead to serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
"We are completing the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It is necessary to carry on the recovery plan again, but I believe we are," Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on the markets of the actions that are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, the legislators are thus trying to reach a definitive agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
In other words, they want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the market in Monday as a result of the Congress decision.
But for now it is not absolutely clear when the two Chambers of the American Congress will vote the law and even if the negotiations will be stopped at the last moment on some problem.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount envisaged for support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has asked.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum if it has the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the end 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Even though the President may veto this decision, Congress may overrule its right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thought of the program has remained, i.e. to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, the price of which has fallen due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law Sunday and the Senate Monday," as the Republican Senator mentioned.
The American President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's positive move and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold parachute
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the main spokesperson, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the fractionation of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for managers of companies participating in the programme and is setting up a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a big step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan counts on aid to the owners of the homes that have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates that it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly debt expenditure for debtors and allowing it to keep their houses.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government will divide the losses between them," said Marek this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"More importantly, this week, Congress representatives find an agreement on the support of this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this most important moment," said Marek.
Last Blood Dueline: MP3 Players Against Cellulars
We'll advise on how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy just the phone.
In spite of this, there are many reasons why an autonomous reader should be sought.
The choice depends entirely on how you use it and the needs of the future owner.
Maybe you'd hardly buy yourself an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
First of all these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is not even a objective reason.
If, however, on your shelves you have hard-rock,jazz or blues vinyls, such a turntable like you dream of.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply MP3 format.
Here, too, there are the categories of prices and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader 8,000 crowns, as well as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests the headphones from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes of which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Decision-making is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players manage to do a lot more than just read music, but they don't even make cell phones by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile phone.
Along with primary functions, phone and send text, can read music and videos, record both and has a camera, sometimes worse and maybe can also navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and palms you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle because no refrigerator can make the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on your mobile and first the indicator on your screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones can read the music for more than 12 hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As far as economic cell phones are concerned, they may last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst lasts at least 9 hours to continuous functionality with a charging.
A further problem arises when you download the music into your mobile.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and in addition not all can be connected to the computer without a special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without an adapter for the minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and readers are created alone a multimedia library ordered by interpreters' names, album names, genres or by user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device, be especially interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If you need the music above all from the background and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram you need a mobile phone whatever MP3 reads.
This can be done now, clearly on any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about what the phone or the player knows.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of the devices supports music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by the Apple company and its Ipod).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another supplier) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a mobile phone-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited only to the hit of the time of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of selling music (either via GSM ,internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always take the cell phone behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to some flea in his pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, whether you always take behind the headphones or at least the wireless earphones.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest normally cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for common headphones.
The best and technically equipped mobile phones and even with the 3.5 mm handle for common headphones cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
On the other hand, the benefit of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones aren't necessarily cheaper (see our choice) really make it for anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of crashing the launch of the mobile internet network and as a result of a giant data transmission bill.
What equipment to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, entered into the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
Base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones also do it with 8 GB memory card.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy even a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you must not spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners you prefer to take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and the convenience of the service thus brings you closer to the same MP3 player.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more streets, which walkman-line mobiles have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above marks provide you with the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (usually 15 hours, in general up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic already this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer almost all services like their partners in Western Europe.
Here, however, something is missing – a virtual operator who has traditional obligations to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
As the Czech operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe, we have written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the day ČTú also confirmed it, which noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the final steps of the European Commission in regulating roaming tariffs, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of mobile blind operators the SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to start the fight.
Maybe it sounds absurd, too, we have three mobile networks and highly covered over 100 %.
Instead, mobile telephony operators like to boast that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, it also often emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTú) , Pavel Dvořák , which in the past has said that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his own network no longer has many possibilities. (However, it might be difficult to find other frequencies.)
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a significant fall in prices, to which traditional operators would have to react.
At the same time, even before sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar voices were echoed in Britain as we do.
However, it has been shown that the place for operators of this kind is there and that they can really succeed.
After all, we must not go too far.
In February of this year we informed you about the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to conquer more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which in the Czech Republic belongs among other U:phones.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete group-braining.
In order to actually work, that is, more customers than a traditional operator are needed.
They do not carry behind, i.e., relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and SMS at little price, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
So for example Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS that cost as little as half as its competitors.
But as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland it can be a pretty good move even the bet on a group-breed not recently.
This operator aims to say so specifically about men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator who likes and can be trusted," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can establish a similar concept as in Poland as well.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover from the point of view of services is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, they say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there will never be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have many expectations.
Mobilking will be switched on in the other countries in our area," he said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It therefore indirectly confirmed that current operators in the Czech Republic are not definitely in favour of this thought.
On the contrary, they try to do everything because no competing potential is created.
For some time, it has not hidden its own interest in the launch of a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first you get better is.
We have repeatedly negotiated on this possibility with all the Czech operators of the mobile network.
We have already been able to progress in negotiations with some of them," says Pavel Kaidl's spokesman.
So maybe better times are coming.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator must have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, there is an impenetrable wall of silence around its creation.
"At this moment we do not believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed to us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the Telefónika O2 press section.
The specific nature of the Czech market also applies to other operators.
The T-Mobil Martina Kemrová press spokesman adds in a rare agreement with the O2 declaration: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "On the T-Mobile network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this moment we will have to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it can be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone concentrates its attention rather than reaching its 3G licence requests.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators and this in particular in the context of spending and infrastructure sharing.
We consider this, from the customer's point of view, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
Competent authorities - with complicating operators
The attitude of mobile telephone operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thereby to a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The disturbances around the creation U:fon testify that when the operators hold to something they know how to get back on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure pressed against ČTú in the period of creation of U:phone to the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to public access information from ČTú web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as a topic for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The competition environment of the mobile telephony market has been greatly enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that another competitor’s entry would place on him and above all on his high claims services.”
However, the attitude of mobile telephony operators is quite surprising to the complete disinterest by the Czech regulators.
It is not only the attitude of the ČTú that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no power to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this in relation to the whole problem has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract of the rental of the required infrastructure between mobile operator and virtual operator had been realized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers probably has not been quite interesting for traditional operators," said Kristian Chalupa, from the UOHS external relations section, in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators might not surprise.
On the other hand, the office which must defend the interests of consumers and, above all, take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Out abroad where virtual operators commonly work, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of UOHS.
It is truly shocking in the whole situation that the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it really is just a coincidence is a matter for itself.
Similarly, the same price of petrol for all petrol plants is undoubtedly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section has not found any signs of anti-competitive behavior regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so he does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for his behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing the telecom regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course there is the analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTú, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has – at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of his network.
So for a certain portion must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for UOHS it should be a minimum alert that three mobile operators do so strangely similar.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the mentioned GTS Novera company) show that during negotiations with all operators encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to ČTú in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which UOHS is kept out of the whole matter.
This has already been found in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of Čtú's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law has been updated, despite the fact that many experts from this point of view expected to improve the situation.
This is what UOHS representatives need to know more about, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it, when no one looks
While we are not aware of the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, some of them even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile telephony services but are only partially public.
These are usually multilevel marketing companies.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the ready persons.
The magic is that the company against the operator appears as a classic business customer, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit a similar presale.
"If the cases in question were presented, of which we will be interested, we could be dealing with breach of contractual conditions, and could result in the conclusion of cooperation with that company," she replied to the question Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile telephone operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
The activities of these companies, that is to say, make a profit that is not indifferent and at the same time - unlike the actual virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, only a negligible percentage of customers uses the services of these companies.
These must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot have in full of it as usual customers of mobile telephone operators "
But this should be a little strange to ČTú.
In addition another issue for UOHS is opened.
If mobile operators close their eyes in front of such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has strong enough rights to hide similar activities and if you do not want to do so you will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When We're Not Costier
As has already been said many times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant fall in prices for services.
At the same time in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were almost identical - too small market, at the limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries in these cases, the defence regulators intervened not by mobile telephone operators but by their customers.
Both with the formal measures and with the non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and to him more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators launch from one another all the time as a boiling potato.
For our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes it more than comfortable.
But don't throw your sponge.
If the backstage information is right and the virtual operator will really appear from us, the Czech mobile phone market will be re-engineered.
If one of the operators consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only UNOHS could hardly remain impermissible to the refusal (discrimination) of the other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech enno has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the Czech State recognition day, solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde kaslav m inquisition".
The new recording of the anno was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four available versions – solo with male or female voice, choir step and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anno's revisions are Otakar Jéréiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and also the chorus, have the clear dictionary, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year the 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde masquisov m aj" was first played in 1834 on stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroupa.
He bought popularity and people spontaneously made it his own.
The first stanza of the song after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" inno sounds
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will accompany you for the first time even with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when in the metro, tram and bus will be the first passengers who instead of the paper ticket will have in their pocket an electronic card.
At this point, if you can search for about one hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the one from 30 and 90 days and annually (which will be from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their paper reloaded in the Infopoints and the offices of the Transport Company and at the Muzeum Metro Station, M, Stek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The cut can already be bought on the website from yesterday to the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service took advantage of more than four hundred customers before the afternoon.
Those who begin to use the Internet service can completely forget the doors in the metro stops where so far they have to make long files for paper tickets.
Cutting is purchased via the Internet and on Opencard is charged on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a workshop with trained staff that will help those interested in the purchase on the internet and will also record on their card the credit they have acquired." said the spokesman for the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to load the electronic cutters on Opencard in ATM and self-service that are installed at the metro entrances.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they look like ticket savers and passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the Roztyly Metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them throughout the city, but by the end of the year they should be eight," Optrný concluded.
The cutting will be checked instead of the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after cutting payment, it will be loaded above.
Electronic cards are valid for tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, that the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the additional trains in the integrated transports of Prague there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity," explained the way in which Filip tickets are checked by the Ropid organisation, which sets out the schedules for the public transport of Prague.
Urban buses have the card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
During the ascent it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the point determined next to the case.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded cutters.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded cuts, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the cut-off expires, can again go to self-service ATM, where the cut-offs are loaded on paper.
Here you will see the information on the validity of their documents on the device screen.
South Germans wanted a referendum from the USA
The South Germans in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is from the letter deposited in the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States at least.
With this desire, according to what is said, some German groups of the South addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also the result of the letter stored in a private archive and now deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask the American President in his letter not to allow the return of the "District of Šumava" – occupied by Hitler on the basis of the agreement of Monaco – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units arrive in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," he writes in the letter signed with the words "The people who hold to the fate of Šumava with all their heart".
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the Swedes hope only to brutality, to the lack of regard, to misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray the American president to assume the dictatorship on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you will recognize this territory as a state to us alien, that oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all to the victory of the Allies," he writes in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the cult of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the USA were to doubt the German conviction of Šumava , it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or to live under the rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses, it appropriately describes the expectations of then the South Germans.
Even if the Czech Germans had to at least understand that they would be moving from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate a sort of autonomy for the peoples of the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp in Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans were going to find him to teach him the Czech.
"These believed that once you returned home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia at the top of the war, according to him, counted that on the basis of Beneš' decrees they would have been moved by the Republic.
Don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history addressed to road safety.
Even so, we could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Ebíček is expected to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour to the steering wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on the flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the effect of alcohol to the steering wheel.
And also remind him to put his belt on before leaving.
He wants to touch the conscience above all the young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not for the most part professional drivers.
What's going to happen on the spot?
Especially people's stories that will affect emotions.
And this is also witnessed by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't think you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is written capital on the plate.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The spots will "fear" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with dramatic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It is thus promised to lower the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"With the drivers the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass red and so save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
It is worth recalling the risk to drivers," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the hospital Na Homolce.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels warning drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel warning of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention," warns Kořán.
Mr Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the Israeli provisional government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, that is, also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published Monday , the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the areas (employed), if not all of them," Olmert told the daily.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but to the Palestinians we will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the possible refund will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the rapists or the spreaders to pass him on, as happened to one of my best friends, he will have to give up part of Jerusalem," noted Olmert in connection with the two attacks of July in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of wounded people.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mountain of the temple, sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City. .
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he added.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert also pronounced himself for Israel's withdrawal from Golan's heights, that is to say, the necessary condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know what to give up in order to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to abandon the current relationship with Iran; they will have to abandon their relationship with the Hezbollah (Scities Movement); they will have to give up permanent support, which they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (Scities Movement) of Al-Qaida (Terrorist Network) and Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after the incident: Are Stewards illegal in buses?
The law does not recognize them, you cannot walk on the bus that takes long distances
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padua by the coach of the Student Agency, the question came out if the steward and passengers could move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws severely and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
Last week’s accident with which a 22-year-old hostess lost his life was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the less secure seat of the coach, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can do an accident or stop abruptly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether the bus is equipped with or not seats according to the driving licence.
If passengers are not approved, they must be seated.
The buses of Student Agency did not stand, confirmed it at the Aksuáln in .cz website of the director of Radim Jančura.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow the passenger movement on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The road traffic law only recognises the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds the spokesperson Hanzelka less clearly.
The Director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law is sufficiently sensitive to this problem.
Depends on whether the bus has approved seats.
That's it," he says.
Categorizes buses in urban areas where there are the standings and the maximum limited speed, Interurbans with standings with maximum speed and long traffic without standings with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the standard movement on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are no many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
It's not even safe there when a turbulence arrives and the flight assistant can knock his head off."
"If the bus makes a rough brake, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Same as in the city bus or on the tram.
The carrier must resolve the safety of the steward by means of an internal regulation," he says, and also intends that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers Steward services..
This takes about two hundred.
Even after the incident, the Director considers their occupation dangerous.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider Steward's profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers while they come out.
They would also reduce expenses," he says.
Asian director Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines with respect to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewarding on his means as an interest in security.
"We have no hostess, we are already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," Týden.cz said less than a year ago.
There has been an immense tragedy.
A young hostess of the Plzeň region, who had worked for the company for two years, died in the line accident for Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably came out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road by the bus.
The coach driver tried to avoid it with a rough maneuver, but hit it with the front right.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two places reserved for the stewart rest were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in buses on long traffic, they are inaccessible."
The company plans to denounce the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the Court’s judgment to pay the damages to the girl’s family, but a financial compensation is expected from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to a clarification of the movement of the Stewarts on board the buses.
"But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They don’t consider the buses so much, they deal more than the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone during the drive," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the Stewarts as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes the spokesperson Havellka, that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
Düsseldorf hopes point to Frankfurt
Words are not missing in the letter from the WestLB director addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the center of the capital market of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of units of the bank institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a "competent block" with lasting profits in such an undertaking.
Furthermore, such a union could be a decisive push for further links in the Länder banking sector.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the WestLB affliction is still under strong pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the National Authority for the Financial Surveillance Service, having noted some time ago the Regional Government of Northern Rhine-Westphalia that time restricts the search for a future solution.
Of the ties between the Deka Bank, that the same customers of the Savings Bank because of their investment funds already know, and WestLB is definitely already talking about it for a while, even by Frankfurt.
He reported in late August the chief of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas on the presentation of the first half of the year's turnover that a merger of the house at via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, which for half is brought by the regional banks and consortia of the savings banks, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with the West LB on common contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts thereof.
But the conversations have, as they say in the business square, just started.
Of the Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the ones that count most in the business square in Frankfurt, it is not mentioned the first time when it comes to consolidating the sector of savings banks.
In 2003 it appeared that Deka-Bank could be founded with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
There was nothing of this three-party association.
As soon as the projects were published, the Asian regional bank was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have often thought about a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end Günther Merl, president of the Helaba board of directors, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
Apart from this, it seems that awareness is created, that it is necessary to approach the different houses of the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank could take place with that of Baden-Württemberg.
For Hellaba is not quite a good news.
If pressure increases for other mergers, partners will be missing by hand.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although he has so far surpassed the financial crisis much better than the houses in Monaco and Stuttgart.
The Asian-Turingia Savings Banks Association, which participates with 85% of Helaba, has put the chain to the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain.
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses are dealt with.
In June Merl pointed out that in the decisive question, with which business model the future of the regional banks would be assured, a response would not yet be given by the German savings bank association.
In the end, the West LB division could also come out, which of course is not desired.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the desire to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer party is dedicated to Italians
For Elena is the first time while for Luca is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them the barrel of 5l. of the Kaiser brand stands a barbut massif and shows about 200 travellers who are the deep tons that can produce from the throat.
Elena first from Luca a pack and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, leave this evening at 23.45 four runners with destination Monaco, Festival della Birra" , expected arrival at 6.30 p.m.
Three runners are mainly reserved for Italians, in another Brazilian-only traveler.
In a parking corner the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, that it's not for Italians.
Mark wearing a long coat with false fur liner and a couple of glasses with silver wide sticks belong to him.
For 5 years they've been going to Oktoberfest, this year they've been 3 tours.
The walk at night, from day to party, back at 22.30.
Nightfall would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the rules of Bavarian genuineness, the sick box and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at Brenner's turn.
There's still no beer.
Then the silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better that way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plate on the A9 motorway before Monaco take a short break.
When, as planned, the Marco group arrives at 6.30 a.m. at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Knowledgeing.it".
Second, "When they open the doors of the beer tendon, it means running!", quoted Marco in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, we block, and not all the yellow beers sitting on the same benches, divide into the active space!"
The mouthpiece costs 8,25 Euro, cries Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Show the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "We meet again at 22.30 p.m. at 2:00 p.m. at 2:00 p.m., understand?"
Yeah, he's leaving for the party.
On the way one attacks like following the yellow beers to the trees, to the road signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the party, known as "end of the Italians".
Exact data do not exist, talk of 50 thousand, who start to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come from Italy specifically.
The police in Monaco are reinforced with 7 agents of South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are first placed with 200 medical treatments in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the trend of Hofbräuhaus.
1. Insomnia nights for the creditors of the Royal Summer Hypo
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed the Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also pointed out that the German banking sector is not spared by critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, obtains a billionaire credit from a consortium of German banks in order to be able to protect from turbulence on the markets.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
The Royal Summer Hypo must only pay interest for the requested party.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
The state financier according to a newspaper article has refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible because of the lack of markets.
In the first half of 2008 the bank reserves had decreased by 95% over EUR 2.37 million, also the share of its own capital fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared to last year, profits from increases both in demand and certain shares as to the settlement of loan provisions have dropped more than 70% of the 5 mL of Euro.
Only due to higher income from the refund of subordinate compensation costs, both from the restructuring of the ex-Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of tax laws and business management for business consortia, has the negative profit been quite moderated with about 16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 had lost in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were incorporated into the Area Bank.
Given that the income in the classic state funding was too low, Depfa has been more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors ( PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hyper Real Estate now has to amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is, dividends have been deleted.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Royal Summer Hypo after the absorption of the Depfa is an important financer of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit allocation between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs for a portion of the Depfa’s credit portfolio – about 50 mld. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to the announcement of the Royal Summer Hypo, the group's financial needs have been covered by credit for a certain period and the company protected by the influence of international monetary markets for most non-functioning.
From other sources you feel, that thanks to money the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
On the contrary, the chairman of the HRE Steering Committee of Georg Funke said that the HRE Group will not need monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the HRE Group's marketability is still ensured.
This is expected for bank shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and taxation of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be fully used.
But even the opposite is not to be ruled out.
After Sunday evening the bank learned what it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The stocking course collapses by 75% on 3.30 Euros.
They're pretty good at loan courses.
While the above-debt debts are almost unmovable, they yield the courses of late loans.
They are mainly the loans of the Württemberg-Hypo affiliate, which can be understood to be due beyond 2009.
Before HRE loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which with the importance of the Depfa has overrun the crisis, be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Only when the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, can it be counted on a depreciation of the annuals within the deadline.
Or it will work, what no one can hope for – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But you are referring to the information that has been raised because of the partial statizations, the probability almost certainly has become a justified hope.
It will mainly create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision if they divide up from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the return on losses for future payments of the profit and loss tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, the first day of school should meet at the Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to make up: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I thought I'd go to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to the Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road alone and fortunately I didn't miss it.
The beginning of the first hour of lesson does not seem to have been set as well as by us in Lower Saxony.
The schoolchildren arrive early from 8 onwards until 8.40 a brief interview with the professor, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who speaks willingly in front of people, in front of a class of 40 schools.
Since I had no school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
This way I put myself in front of the chair and tried to say well, "Sayonara Wo She Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very glad that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have whispered, edited and made a sign and then I heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew this one from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "beautiful, sweet".
Then I ran fast to my place.
The girl next to me sneered, for you was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson hour was continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
Everything talked undisturbed and re-enacted and dried me up with questions – then it is really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the break everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the basket for the Lunch- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of meat and tofu envelopes.
Actually, I don't even know exactly what I'm eating in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
It is done, that everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under the salt, Brrr!
Bento is not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a Bento made herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of getting to know the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga comic book.
I'm really curious if you can find out.
Why did Japan ask me my friends when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Japan.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
Finally, I have been reading the Mangas fervor for years.
And to better understand the comics and culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn a little Japanese.
I was absolutely convinced to come once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
Here they hold a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I've never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a scaffold escape when they feel the danger.
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: too many animals have feelings.
4. But how can it be verified if, when they behave in the same way, they have our own feelings?
Articles of well-known scientists have been published in the "Edge" Internet newspaper for a number of years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of conscience, without me or anyone else so far being able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have a conscience.
But in this case at least we have to hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we address the other species and ask questions about the feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the base of reference does not compete.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do. That means he pretends to be dead, he flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, it often connects the lateral prefrontal cortex with human awareness, associated circuits (this because of its direct sharing with short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it lacks completely.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus accept the basis on the assumption that man differs even from the other primates.
Another dramatic detail should appear in the way of speaking about man: since a large part of life is linked to the language, it is often said that it is related to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as is done, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to find out how conscience can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its own experience because of the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which for science it would be easier to have access.
Animal consciousness processes could be analysed without regard to their contents, and this can be done in the short-term memory studies of primates, particularly in the example of viewing.
So for this principle, that Christof Koch und Francis Crick follow, he goes first to the neural correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the frontal bark for the implementation of the display.
What, then, is designed for feelings?
I impose them on the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) occupys the working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely related to the regions of the bark, which characterize the primates and in particular human beings.
With the speaking nature they create subtle shades of feeling, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the regions of the body of the sensations of the bark and of the cephalus, similar to Jack Pankseep, who however focused more on paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is clear.
Pankseep raises arguments that what for rats and human beings appears as fear, is likely to be felt this way with the senses in both cases: but how could it be verified if rats and human beings prove the same when they behave in a similar way?
A scarf in case of danger flees as if he even felt fear?
In my eyes, the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet show any vital resemblance.
And that is, neural comparison continues to help: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephals, scarfing not even a brain.
But is the paleoencepal responsible for the feelings?
And even when it could be proved for human beings: how would we want to prove it about rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who know?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, here are progress on a neural level, provided that the same procedure on rats and men is discontinued.
As I don't search for language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered myope, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually crashing against a wall.
I'm a practical emotional person, by the way.
President of UEFA Platini: referral to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europes with Poland," Wasjunik said
"This, however, is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both the master countries of the house fall into the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stages to be taken to the Europeans will be even reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at the highest speed," said the President of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the national Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
Many exhibitors of the first division only in the last season were condemned for manipulation, in the end it had even had to postpone at the last moment the beginning of the League.
Dennis Quaid Ribatette Ingrid
He wanted to promote a new film, in the interview he talked about the private and now he has grain with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared his former Dennis Quaid adultery.
He foams of rabies and rivets.
War of the Roses in a late burst for the former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two actors of Hollywood now contend with each other a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time expressed himself on the grounds of marriage failure: "Dennis has been long unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The extent of betrayal she would have come to know it only after the separation.
The occasion for the "spoil of the soul" was the work with Ryan's press for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adulterary is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his publicly declared adultery husband was clear: it would be "unheard", he said to the "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the last time repeats and recreates the history of our relationship".
It would also be "sorry" that Jack, the sedentary son who had together, again "will be remembered publicly the pain and subverting, that a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives out of separation on his own, Quaid is again married and will soon become father of twins.
And therefore his judgments are closed with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnights in the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analyzed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter it observed an obvious decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6 % lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year before..
The American Express sees as a reason for this the weak quote of the dollar, which would lead to a "calent desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city hotels prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
As regards flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still stands:
Due to Cherosene charging, passengers at Economy Class had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range flights of fuel would be even more expensive than 29.2%
From April to June the prices of the Economy Class air tickets fell by 12.5% on average compared to the previous quarter, however, in the first class and in the Business, price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9%, and in the second quarter fell by 23.6%.
As for the German domestic flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for falling prices would be lower economic growth on the one hand, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has broken down.
On the other hand, there would be an agreement on open skies, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of non-profit routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 they declared bankruptcy – only in Europe was treated by 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, the Luxembourg VS becomes a chief.
At Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for the national player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player got into the game first late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was accurately formulated, he passed it on to his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg arena cabins.
It didn't happen much in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of it was sitting in its place again.
Rieger has been HSV physiotherapist for almost 3 decades, enjoys an even greater estimate of some older players.
And so his monito also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol announced and raised his thumb in a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the chief coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded the same way: here's the second goal!
The position change did not occur.
"Today it wasn't all good to see," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also "be more relaxed".
For the 1 to zero those in Hamburg must thank the head shot went to Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the many weak players in Gladbach could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It's been a dirty win," said Martin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years.
The spectators celebrated earlier, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing classification on the screen, which legitimized their sport society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We're able to put things right," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the feeling that the provisional table certificate is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petrin door as well as Jansen blown to the FC Bayern – finds it slowly itself, but it has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol relaunchs forcefully.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: the dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einsteins' relativity might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fast-frozen fuel pipes, the death due to freezing is now on you.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of the space probes, with which they obtain additional release/painting/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American search probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedient as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has surprised scholars for years: rockets do not behave at all as expected in accordance with the law on gravity.
In fact, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year marked the anomaly of the Swing-by.
Some experts fear that perhaps the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, might not be exactly.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of the Swing-by by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
"Responsible for anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
From the existence of dark matter, space scholars have only known for about 10 years.
There is clearly a force of attraction from her, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is seen.
She is, instead, completely invisible, i.e. does not send or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter is at least one good fifth of the whole mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a shootout before release 6 kidnappers were killed.
5 Germans were abducted in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for the ransom are already under way.
Germans are always in the eyes of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This agreed with Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the story of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been freed
We are examining their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of a expedition in the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The backstages of a shooting that took place prior to the release of the hostages remain unclear: so the kidnappers after the indications of a Egyptian public security agent would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army had killed at surprise 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed for a ransom," the official said.
It would be "still tried to take over the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers claimed from Germany a ransom of 6 million euros; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the liberation of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release women hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men should have been kept as long as the kidnappers did not have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
The abuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led a woman to kill herself, declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornovaglia, has been in prison for 6 years after having admitted eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had been killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a little girl and lived in Coventry, Trerise was harassing her and nagging her before having sex, while her mother was outside working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he came back to live in Cornwall.
Her daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a long time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and had "molted with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
He is thought to have been killed by suffocating himself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's father-in-law, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "The Ally and the Ally".
"I didn't sexually disturb her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "She is an extremely strange fetishist, and for her victim she must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This unfortunate saga ends with the victim taking his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't done it, it would have been difficult for the facts to end up in front of the court."
I note the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother have had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she was a promising and happy young man of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be accused by the Official Secrets Act, learned the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defence when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made by this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal intent.
The defense correspondent for BBC Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They thought this was treated internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be accused under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguard of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be accused by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capacity of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over £80,000 after the Bradford & Bingley bank was rescued.
The government has given £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of £14 billion will eventually be repaid when the loans of Bradford & Bingley will be redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid annually to the 700 financial companies taking deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies accepting deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is annoying that those institutions that have behaved prudently are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million pounds to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the association of construction companies, told the BBC that he thinks he is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the market taking houses are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," added Mr Cole.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk rises to 5 penny per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact of having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be a wholesale price increase in its milk for an extra five penny per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a search carried out by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide for themselves whether they want to download the increase in the price on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Denial of bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh refused a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him a bail for having exorbitant 50 million taka ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament
The case is one of the many allegations of corruption that they hang against you.
The long-standing political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh by Sheikh Hasina is planned for the coming weeks, but his party, Awami League, asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military on the day before the complete freedom.
The correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can stay free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The high court has refused the bail request for Sheikh Hasina claiming that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical care," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall present or appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
He expects to return to Sheikh Hasina's house after 17 October, said a senior leader of the Awami League party on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the government joined the military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for Afghan anti-poly campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, says the UN.
The UN carried out a six-provincial vaccination programme last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach children in the Helmand and Kandahar parts in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesperson said that this happens despite the promises of the Taliban who would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation impeded the competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB participation in ITV gives rise to doubts about the independence of ITV, making the Competition Commission launch an investigation.
The head of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB aggregated that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would understand it it is voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the U.S. investigator
The US Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a case report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical towards the White House, the legislators and the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor's Office Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Series of charges concerning potentially criminal behaviors have not been fully investigated or verified," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine American prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said lawyers had been fired for expired performance.
But later on, it appeared that the dismissed lawyers had not been evaluated as being more late than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the judicial action against high-profile Republican members of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
American prosecutors investigate and carry out court cases on behalf of the government.
They may be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for dismissal, and eventually re-designed his position.
A number of other officers from the Justice Department were fired.
(The report of the Inspector General was very critical in relation to Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had primary responsibility for dismissals, that he had abdicated to his role as leader and had been extraordinarily detached during the process.
Other officers, including the former senior assistant of Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The Epic of the Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for its epic Anno Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honored" to earn recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track of the 1977 album by Meat Loaf.
The Coldplays will conduct appointments for this year's prizes, being on the list of appointments in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was made as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached its fifteenth place.
But the album by Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell remained almost nine years in rank and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - true name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on the stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
He later appeared that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon on sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossings, some famous ones, others merely of use.
But also many veteran and long-standing tax collectors find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, at the very least because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north of the First Street – without doing the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet of width and 120 feet in length, it resembles more like a dusty alley than an active traffic track.
There's no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlantic.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-standing neighbors who say that they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the gentleman quarter of the past.
But the department for the preservation and development of the city, which has control of the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Commission of the Surroundings some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay have outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to present next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of the Community Board 3 district.
"There is very little space left to the city's property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to fix and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small road and install seats, including some to be used for a café to which the real estate company hopes to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, an Avalon Bay spokesman, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this delict alley and transform it into a public threat," he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation Accommodation, said that it was the city's desire to sell the road and noted that the purpose of the agency was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to her most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a light historical print.
Some believe that he took his name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps better known as the photo cover set of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The land was beautiful," said Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, brands of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers writing about "genrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, bringing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of city almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Regrets: A little nostalgic look at the city being extinct"), published part of a talk in the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an enchanting vicar without exit, also dark by day and bounded doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with the Saracens, with old newspapers of weeks that run along the bottoms."
With few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent night.
A rat hurriedly ran through the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls there were graffiti and a 22-eleven-empty bottle of beer lay near a group of abandoned fresh newspapers.
Few passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place but they suggest that it would need to be a little beautified.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that some people are also underestimating the attraction of the road in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disguising places. "
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior student in California and senior director of education studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
Really attracting the Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "Afro-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in language classes other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
School students are for the Spanish and low-income majority.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have arrived recently, are studying English.
But, among fourth grade students, a surprising 100 percent of the students did the higher level test in the 2008 state of mathematics exam.
An equally surprising 93% of fourth-century students did the expert level test on English-language art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from the one Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes the recuperation and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of "no apology".
In addition, and it is here that Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the obstructive approach of the school for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just came from Mexico and if you had entered class 12 months later you wouldn't have been able to identify who she was."
"It works," he said, "for us it works."
Obama would model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools by a majority in Spain and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent Mr. Obama from predicting the answer.
While he agreed that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the issue trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps of achievement, he should consider carefully the educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil is falling sharply and is renewing economic fear
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The futures of the barge fell from 7% to $99.80 in the barrel to the New York merchant bag in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 to barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices had dropped to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before rising again, on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety affected investors again on Monday even after Congress leaders had said they had reached an agreement on the weekend about the rescue plan, the biggest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last episode of progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachóvia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenzied negotiations of the weekend had led to a rescue agreement " appear to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation gets worse, it is expected that demand for raw materials, including oil, will calm down.
"The perspective for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the infection.
From a raw materials perspective our most pressing concern is how far the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, reducing the forecasts on the price of oil and gas by about 20 percent for 2009.
The second fourth operation marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he saw everything.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a spotless game into a resurgence.
"Never seen such a thing," Ellis said.
The second fourth began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equalled the grayness of the threatening clouds that overtook them with a faint game.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon in which their growing tune has made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't come out of my path," said Favre of all the steps that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch games, the defense hit heavily the headquarters of Cardinals Kurt Warner.
The Darrelle Revis Cornerback intercepted a wandering launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another passage and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the forced fumble by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went to the advantage of that possession of ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets took the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely set a target of 20 yards, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever marked in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe his madness, the coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third fourth?"
When he was told both - the Jets granted 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There's been a lot of points in a little time."
Retired Gebselassie exceeds its world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again because many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the race favorably flat at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sends in brakes for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie developed the world’s 26th record of such a stunning career that produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie jumped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would have made its asthma problems worse.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with an escort average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-founders like Gebrselasie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa del Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had pulp cramps and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselasie said to the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He has been somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having excessively orchestrated his races, usually avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on apilist as if it were a middle-bottom race, and placing world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the size of Gebrselasie's skills as a marathon.
With the step set by four Kenyans Sunday, Gebrselasie reached the midway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held in competition Gebrselassie after the apricots disappeared.
A little over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselasie made a final imperative to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, a Kazakhstan native who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games have been lost with what is described as a bad accident, but is cured to win in Berlin, making his best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon he has run.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan corridors leave with a great detachment, taking them back after about 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya ended third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the theme park extended on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the enormous, lies the quiet city where the pride and the complications of the African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first whole black town incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skips, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that has described - and that makes tourists stop including it in the tour guide of Florida produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is so independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little about us, doesn't know what is missing."
Even now, in a year when a black presidential official, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain dissident from the outsider's gaze.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident of the entire life and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes undeserved, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern about Eatonville's imagination really started with Zora, who all here call Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside Rout 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida inside a scenario of black history and human drama
Low as a crab in both life and literature, Hurston brought readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with the finishings in white, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller was always watching, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passage rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this wasn't from Fodor.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it like it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalizes her by quoting men who sing gross songs about their beauty.
She adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric that often returned from his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston was raining in the city, he usually arrived without notice in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts dignified clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, Mr. Franklin says, while others were whispering.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But he added, waving on his chair on the backyard above Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "he never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books had gone out of print.
Together with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it.
Although he was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in a tomb without a plate in Fort Pierce, Fla., where he had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no big conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-course highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-course highway.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed The Interstate 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to its idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle about racial mixing carried hatred on the community door.
"During that period, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things into the people sitting on the side," says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a coconut out of a car."
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request for forced integration to the Supreme Court, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honour for my race".
The residents now say that the segregation of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, dilutes the cohesion of Eatonville and undermines the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - hug your teacher in the morning, embrace your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This will last, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudice, as he did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny to themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can't quite understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the tomb without a plate of the Hurston and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway struck the shelves of the bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The project of the highway arrived just as her most famous daughter had once again blocked the lights of the slope.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a savior.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many returned for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its project on the road.
"The five races of the rising highway, they brought what would be said to be high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it easier: "Today saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project has helped to change the idea that the city has itself.
Those outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a sheltered and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, can give the feeling of a secondary road under summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800s.
(It is 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things - like the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for bright red, still fears that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the festival has expanded, there has also been a high level of citizen pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston, saw its entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, no worse and fair, creative, great worker, foolish and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's grandson Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they've just come in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after the Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a nice city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stalls and the huge Times Square TV screens, they wouldn't notice to be in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nested on their heads, the bankers and the hedge fund managers that monopolize New York live every day the worst "bad day in the office" since the fall of 1929.
Farmers shake metal trolleys for the tea through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken shirts strung onto a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the issue so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's door, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service's door, where old customers order cheque books, tourists ask directions for the big Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trust banker", were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from places where pendulums are made, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken the money from the so-called thrift (a little like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family.
In recent years, 15 of these banks went bankrupt.
In recent days, the Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and, while the New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer to save her.
Employees and clerks who were standing in front of me, scared of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a secure port, the bank that is demanding more bail on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in the past few weeks have become financially competent.
A woman to my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and to her emaciated CEO Dick Full in all familiarity, as if licking a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform portina, almost fifty years of my condominium, has changed the subject from our normal conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expense.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim tombs profane while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Party of Liberty and Philip Dewinter of the Belgian right party Vlaams Belang, take part in an event to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They bring type signals to the road representatives of the mosques with a red line passing through the middle.
The police blamed the extremists on the right for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the far right have earned much from the national general elections.
More than 90 graves have been severely damaged at Traun's cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits drew with the spray Jewish symbols like David's Star over some graves, but the detectives believe it could be an attempt to mask the extremist motivations led by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the news of desecration, which took place toward the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance to Muslims.
Austria meanwhile embarked on a spiritual research journey following its turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right parties who took almost 30% of the votes, the Austrian freedom party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with vehemently anti-immigrant tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to the foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties appear to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, suggesting that they are political symbols of continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have established the extreme right as the nation's strongest political block, indicating that the change was mainly carried out by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad banned to Gary Glitter.
At Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain by court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities that they wanted to go to Spain from France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent's police last Thursday after he had provided the magistrates with proof of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford preture in Kent but was represented by lawyers of Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford preture, Kent's police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the registry of convicted persons for sexual offences.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice on his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent's police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements in the country.
A spokesperson from the Kent police said, "Kent's police will do everything they need to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have the right complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the conduct of convicted sexual offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risks to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have moved him to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him enter and return to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge preture, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to include him in the register of convicted sexual offenders.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having had images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the secretary of the Interior felt assured and happy that Glitter had been stopped by traveling to France and Spain.
"Photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels, nor flying, nor first dressed.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On one side the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, at those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of hands, are natural because they don't have to go to the stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the least known side of these masters.
With this goal, the photographer offers an original flamenco iconography, picking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and makes it clear that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that it is not the typical pictures of artists, interpreters or executioners on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the road" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the public.
To catch the personality of these great ones you don't need to draw them on stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the big flamenco."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at depicting singers, guitarists or dancers using a plated camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and material, remember the classic photograph.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the modern picture, according to an idea that reflects the conception of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not the dance, the singing or the playing in itself, but the artist's personality, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, have been and have been the constant of this work, in display these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy artists portrayed.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited at the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portrait portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to draw people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, either a long moment or a short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult kind in photography.
You meet or compare yourself with people, characters who sometimes don't even know or give you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concreteize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at the number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "azzardo"
It is set in places that still does not know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is in the grip of a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Since always preferred for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is an azardo" and that "everybody indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had any sense, I would not write it, but I will do it as well and hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw passing to the city of Acquedoto a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La cità y los dogs" was, as a forecast, the prominent figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" book, filled the venues of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer has found himself in front of an audience to which time has flowed when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, has recalled in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "to live beyond what I was living"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "uninspired of inspiration", with intense work of documentation, writing and continuous remaking; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories lay.
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "has effects" and that "makes people more anti-conformists." That is why he invited the writers to "do not give in to frivolity" and to "take responsibility" of their vocation.
The time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of the races
The celebration of the corridors that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the towers selected for the corridors had verified that the conditions of the square soil were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather went against this Festival, preventing two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the performance of the second race of thor.
The posters included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face a bull of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held on a regular basis only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque to triumph, cutting three ears and coming off in triumph, after having toasted with taste and aesthetic.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races by receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by reason of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and no penalty.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, he won the fists of most of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish exceeds the block position in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Agents inform the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they run away.
Agents have harassed the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping to escape.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., as reported in the Department of Interior of the Basque Government's notice.
The person arrested is accused of drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some road officials from Alava were carrying out transport control over the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop a van for the inspection when the driver, violating orders, speeded up sharply and went over the lock place.
The agents followed up until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the roadside and its two occupants fled to a forested area.
Ertzaintza agents were able to arrest one of the fugitives and kidnap the 2,178 kilograms of hashish that they carried and took action once they inspected the van, a Iveco Daily.
Hashish panels, which were in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since the officials found that the registration was "doubled" because it did not coincide with the document in the van's documentation, the offence of forgery of public documents was also charged to the arrest.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspected person, who managed to escape as already said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and to be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Arrested the actress Heather Locklear to guide under the effect of medications
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for guidance under the effect of drugs.
A witness saw him perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the magazine People by a speaker from the street of California.
The witness specified that around 4:30 p.m., the Locklear "shocked down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to take out the car from the parking lot with sudden maneuvers forward and back. Doing backwards, she passed several times in front of her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first appeared not to recognize the actress, saw that the Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted emergency services, because "she was concerned about the life of Locklear."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"It seemed confusing," and for this reason the agents led it to a specialized drug and alcohol use centre to undergo a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has shown herself collaboratively and the hypothesis of excess alcohol has been discarded from the beginning, even though "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some medication."
The Locklear was arrested with the suspect of driving under the effect of some unspecified substance and was imprisoned in the local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, the Locklear was released from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being admitted to an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callazares urges the Andalusian Federation of the UI to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The coordinator general of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional training federation to take a decision on the case of the former consultant to the Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who signed the resignations last week following the accusation of customerism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares as regards the resolution that the party will have to take with regard to what has so far been a member of the Seville Council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations concerning the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI always wanted this kind of investigation to be as transparent as possible."
In the same way, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public charges."
"Sangre de May", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós' National Episodes, Jose Luis Garci reproposes in Sangre de May the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euro budget.
With this film, the director tried to "lighten the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of interpreters.
Sangre de May, for more than two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in the cinema halls, to become a television miniseries more than four hours on TeleMadrid in the future.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci claims that he has made with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before he turned a memorial film for the second centenary of the 2nd of May. The director had agreed that the story of basing on the novel National Episodios.
The 15 million budget allocated entirely by the Madrid Community represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate scenographies and costumes to draw a "a clumsy Spain that failed the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought to the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinando VII" observed Garci.
However, the director regrets that he has not received funding equal to that of Alatrist or Los Fantasmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de May, so it was not possible to go around some scenes provided by the script that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Return to Start, has influenced what his usual work practice is, the staging with the actors, with which he often uses to try before he turns with those who are not part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliant," considering that "part of the director's work resides in going to theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the field in which he works."
Many of the interpreters, part of whom fall into the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate for Oscar for four times - winner one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood - its Sangre de May, Seven tables de billar French and, the last selected Los gijasoles blind - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
From this film Garci does not expect prizes.
"At first you think you work for posters, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at a certain point you conform to simply spinning one more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Swiss essence of Ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Swiss ballerina pays tribute to another ballerina equally from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana district, and at the age of three moved with the family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of women's emancipation, the calibre of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
This woman's life, which marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this character. I thought it was amazing."
She holds the ballerina: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tanghi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that even my way of dancing is part of this aesthetic," he explains.
The stage includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again in one of his shows, as does "The Open Door"; and that of Mathew Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been his student.
"Matilde interprets Adult Tortula, the character of maturity.
I'm happy that you agreed to work in my work and that's what I'm very honored about."
The setting also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi di Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who interprets the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been dive all around, and who have always had many spasms."
In the work there is in some way also the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially at that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, because, usually, she lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it, because I think it was one of the women who had an enormous influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers it and much less considers its operation as something of value" Bayon claims.
The show will start today at 8.30 p.m. at the theatre of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" the Triennium also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Councillorate to the Culture of the Junta dell'Andalusia to celebrate the "Trinnium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Trinnium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel Prize and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel copo de lumen", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Councillor for Culture of the Junta dell'Andalusia acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poet Reciencasado", by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most valued Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de Malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of the whole of America, in front of the shocking idea that Newman left.
Yet it cost him a lot to deliver an Oscar.
And since 2007 he was retired.
And he was also known to be very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a trial goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or to exaggerate.
He died a father of cinema and homeland at a particularly dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on earth, looking desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and there are many people to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opposer of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and twenty causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the first dead child of overdose to the creation of the brand of home and organic food.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without being cured of nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that he didn't die a man, he ended up a time.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, director awarded Oscar, said that working with Newman constituted nothing less than the apex of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a very high level for all of us," observes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for righteousness and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for 50 years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful while he certainly did not lack the opportunities to be.
"Why am I going to eat burgers today, if I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Among all the great roles that he interpreted, none of them was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, unsolved and philanthropic passionate," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but I think it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which would then be taken into account at the time of the evaluation and I would have to examine them, would be totally negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the retreat of the dorsal, which assumed that it was going before.
It didn't sound like a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, it's just to pull out everything (including chip to avoid code during the race).
Not at all.
You just had to go to get the backrest (first nonsense, go for it only) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they had only 'S' shirts (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small t-shirts, made with smaller fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inextricable compared to the same day of the race.
Besides having to go very soon to take the chip, the queue waiting was 15 minutes and, more importantly, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as was predictable, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once successful in the company, recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts were added of popular rebellion and assaulted at the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the correct rank because of the chip which, I suppose, did not register correctly the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will certainly not come into my mind.
So I think we'll continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for receptionist (virtual)
At the MlT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft first presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case described by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company campus) assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen to and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present in conversational groups.
In the video of example the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that it does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of society.
She asks if she's there to visit someone and tells her she'll be at her disposal shortly.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a strategy change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many programs associated.
Steve Ballmer found out that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would be five times faster – hey! Steve, it would be for "the least".
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change in direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google threw Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the Web browser.
You just take the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and we spend more time browsing the network than in a remote window environment.
What is half the operating system's applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to make them a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, indeed, and I bring here a small example.
I took the photograph inserted in this post in one of the recreation facilities for Microsoft employees, in Redmond, at the beginning of this month.
On the drinking machine, a sign prompts you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to do a network search.
Last week, after all, the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be placed on the market in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was carrying her on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was shining in Edward Zwick's 'Diamonde de sangre', as well as Al Pacino in the 'The Godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola and being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the force with the sharp baffles that lifts the weights in the circle.
It is, in essence, the typical man-made t-shirt, with the interior of cotton, drawn and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, though, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive scheme and for the small Belgian flag (appears recognizable), that the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive scheme and for the small Belgian flag (appropriately recognizable), that the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not only about the famous "tank".
It also includes college hoods, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, marinara t-shirts, baby-dolls, mini short...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't concern me"
The great resemblance with her sister has not prevented her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters have taken their new activities in the field of fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the signature Mango made of its new headquarters, as well as the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, quickly conquers you.
Tell us you're in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we designed my sister Penelope and I for the fall-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
What elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the '50s is 60s, from here we draw various inspirations.
Then, I love losing myself in the city and watching how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it often.
Ballerina, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe that, even if in the end, everything is mixed up and there are many elements in common.
I, as a child, liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to wet in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I've always paid a lot of attention to the dress.
We know that dancers like to have their own style to go to lesson and to the essays, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they give you the wardrobe is the moment you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not a long time ago, you're 30 years old, you're in crisis?
But no.
Never feel better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to taste life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a little girl, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know I'm a mother because I'm asked my own body and I also want to be a young mother, I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do will give my son much happiness and educate him with great love.
As far as the cinema is concerned, you're waiting for some of the films to be filmed in the different rooms last year.
That's right, and I want them to go.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and anxious, I would like everything right away and clearly, but it cannot always be so.
I want him to climb "The Last Hour" and "In Search of Christ's tomb".
Let's see if you'll like
A few days ago you debuted on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not that you were in the walkway as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, has called me to go to London to participate in a charity show for his organization "Done for a better world" and the clothes we have exhibited – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned to collect funds for this NGO from Naomi.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I, who know her for a long time, can confirm that they are not so true.
In addition, I find this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to run for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pine, I would do it anyway.
If it's to help the women of the third world, you can't pull back.
Repeaters of alcoholism will have to install "alcoholic"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive blood alcohol, to install in their car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of roughness or if it does not blow up the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Attorney General of State, according to which it will be a pilot project of the duration of one year.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to attend a road rehabilitation course.
At this initiative, in addition to the Public Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, they will participate in the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the reported motorists reported more than once for driving in a state of ebb then back to driving the car.
Alcohol would avoid this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the breathed air and prevents the motor vehicle from being moved if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than that permitted.
The cost is higher than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices allow to reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out on a regular basis, and, no doubt, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced into experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the PSOE which proposes to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, second programme, the Spanish plane in which the Asturias principles were traveling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was falling but the rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the real couple come down from the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish principles were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time ... you're from here or ...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon made up of 27 marine soldiers who offer the greeting of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, a wind chime, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps told her that she was threatening Mexico City bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a brief stop before passing through the room where they are expected by the official show.
At the hotel door where they are staying, one of the four biggest in the city, a spirit reporter of Mexican television is waiting for them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world most appropriate to present a fashion prize, which not Paris and probably there is no more exquisite designer and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in the Mango showcase at the 54th issue of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept from the emotion.
On the other hand, it is the company's second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite TVs, the gala presidential table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Born, with his broken heart and making necessity virtue, due to his brother's recent death, he wore a house dress and some complements of ELAH to remove the breath and arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the occasion.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honours of the house and as a knight who finished, along with the Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both of them had yielded to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirts – designed by his hand – turned for dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the ballroom and she, recalling other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "big fold".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the rooms of the palace, but had first shown the photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next day we were delighted by the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy who moved on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously assured that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the number against stress
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and one way to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation in the libraries on September 30.
Awakening is almost a punishment when it squirms every morning at 7, but it is still worse to imagine itself involved in the frenetic rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's back.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there is neither one nor two methods to fight daily exhaustion and fatigue to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole "menu" of custom-made options for each person's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is called "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "manual" denies such conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as getting in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not already flow into your veins to regain the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn your mind off and focus on reading.
Talking in the Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very anxiously to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who speak while they are asleep.
The first time it happens, it's at most frightening, but it's not really very important.
This is a benign alteration of sleep called a sleepwalker.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you said that you had spoken in your sleep.
This may occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason why this phenomenon can be explained.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis (do the peep in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned earlier, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it is still unstudyed.
Even the intensity with which it appears is extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite occurs (screams, cries, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and perhaps consult a specialist to check whether there is any question that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a release to the situation.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore, there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if combined with insomnia or stress).
On the other hand, what can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid television programs or series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, relaxing techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once sleepwalkers appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day will not remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you will interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you appear very distressed and episodes have a certain frequency you should consult a doctor or check where such anxiety results in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to ask him an interrogation to get information.
You will not get anything, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not see what he is dreaming to say, so we need to pay very much attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which they might lead.
Don't ever tell the baby you could ask him questions during the night to get to know his secrets.
Not even for jokes.
Something like that causes a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory at home after a long fruitless period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Giallo-neri have created the largest number of network opportunities by turning one into the win of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann host team who broke the seven with a long shot, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from far away, then Hirn high, Romain from the top and again Diebold.
Dannemarie responded with a middle-field block, leaving only the boxed Riahi at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second period was decisive with two initial occasions signed by Riahi and Temporal for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the well-positioned Illhaeusern, he resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the canonist of the Illhaeusern will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates below numerically.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause great problems at the 11th of the Illhaeusern, just inverted to "strengthening" the defense, except in the last few minutes of the game when, after a rocambolesque action, the ball burst the cross.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a stop in Brittany.
The President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in the Finistère department to enchant the representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "he will present himself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit which takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by Breton fishermen in order to take measures to address the price of the gas oil, which reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them the possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and ensure the working conditions and remuneration of sailors."
And fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "lumaca operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of fattening.
Even the port of Quiberon has been blocked, but connections with Belle-Ile have not been interrupted.
A road block was implemented on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday the sailors have already proved their determination by burning, starting at dawn, tyres and pallets in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, as they took to the feet of demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and of the Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the vessels remained at the dock, or to Havre, where a twenty boats have prevented the movement of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the block of the Total Refinery Note of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held Wednesday at the Ministry to decide what action to take.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and possible participation in the planned meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not yield" and "they will not intend to move to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on petrol, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a vessel will only be reached with a gas oil of less than 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of Butch Cassidy died of cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut home.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also welcomed the legend of the film and actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
This year the aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries, despite the threat of recession on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth world company in the sector, maintains the delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 planes, confirmed his president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian company trusts widely in the Chinese market, in particular for the planes of the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered in eight years 41 aircraft to Chinese customers.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, set up by the US monetary authorities, would yield more than 15% of its activities in order to repay the loan of $85 billion, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the transfer of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, specifies the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The board of directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider the possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
The activities that the AIG intends to commit include the airline leaser International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly recover liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion grant from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities impose 80% of its capital.
Paris: History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against the Paulson plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, that is a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10,365.45, lower by 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) above that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, the index of the main technological titles, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the enlarged Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, depending on the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street sank after the unexpected refusal of the bank rescue plan, designed to bring stability back to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives refused the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans out of three refused the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market counts on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project was actually dying (...) then the witness would be passed quickly to the Fed – Federal Reserve – (the US central bank, ndr) and to the other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, head of the finance and economy sector at the Global Insight.
And still highlighting the state of emergency," every day that passes by leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, said Piegza.
After the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the bank assets of Wachovia by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, calling for urgent action in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only in the face of an American crisis, but in the face of a global crisis," added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the Treasure Goods with 10 years expired at 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday evenings, while the yield with 30 years is at 4,161%, against 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama in the forefront of the first TV duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the republican and democratic campaign proclaimed the respective victory of the TV duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although worthy, was not brilliant enough to allow him to slow down in the five-week polls by the presidentials.
The Gallup Institute, of which a public opinion poll Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democrat has had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on an indecisive voter sample found that 39% of them believe Obama to be the winner, while 25% points to McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, awaiting during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
"Underestimating it would be a mistake.
It has a good sense," said Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underlining the opponent's "ingenuity" regarding the arguments faced during the first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that." he often said to multiple shots.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills needed to become president," he assured.
What has been a continuous target for the republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without delay, it has proved concise and precise.
It has promoted its predisposition to the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world scene.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama," he reiterated, this weekend, a democratic spot, reproving the republican that he did not take the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, reported Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a beating rain, for an election meeting.
He did not even say the words "media class" or "workers". The financial crisis is in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point," thought the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's economic sense to that shown by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reiterating the intention of reducing taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street’s losses, the Illinois senator also mentioned among her priorities the achievement of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centres by 2030.
Carefully, the two candidates rejected the questions focused on the plan of financial rescue of 700 billion dollars (EUR 470 billion) adopted last night the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Have you noticed the election?"
Young people and opponents manifested on Sunday evenings in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest in advance the results of the legislatures.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evenings immediately after the closing of the election seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "To what end will they do what they want, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good start to foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by the observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to take part in the vote strip," Jouri Potemkine, spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, an heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It is a façade change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections and the leader of the pro-European movement, since the important one is the one who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If Members of the opposition come into Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because "it is necessary to engage in dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt with Russia, is in crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that ‘the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the polling process.
It stresses that participation quotas seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) has given way to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice what the elections were? Asks the Social Democratic Leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the election seats.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, the ones most convenient to power."
Night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission were successful.
The Meeting - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, since Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public, seriously shocked by the scandal of the infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a tragedy and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994 directed by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was late in writing a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, just 38% of the people declared that they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the following years, we have regained public confidence," he says before saying proud that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, which has been taking place since 1998, as part of the foundation.
"And we did not know absolutely whether that disease could be transmitted by infected blood.
We have therefore based on one of the main recommendations of Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when there are doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than one month in the United Kingdom was refused from 1980 onwards.
Now, for some years, it has been shown that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted by infected blood.
This episode has thus shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for the identification of HIV appeared on the market: the tests of nucleic acid (TAN) that allow the donors to directly recognize the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The NTAs allowed to reduce the window period, or since the person contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be identified in the blood thanks to our techniques, the specialist explains.
That period could be reduced to a period of less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not being able to identify them has been so greatly reduced.
These improvements have allowed a significant decrease in the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will need to be distributed before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes every year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples, it will take more than 24 years before there is a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion.
I believe that you can feel calm today when you receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover your health, says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by an insect.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before pointing out that, in addition to having safe resources, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
"Needs increase as the population grows.
As treatment against the most aggressive cancer, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet intake.
The ageing population also has consequences on the number of donors who on average constitute only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people 18 years of age who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people offered as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is spread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
The cases of distress are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and cannot make donations anymore.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today life is so frenetic that it is hardly an hour to donate blood," says desolata Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, of which bone transplants, eyeball heart valves and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe wear.
These fabrics are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited with the Hema-Québec which manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abundant blood rich in stem cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the entry into the bank of our thousandth blood sample of cordon and we plan to collect more than a thousand of them every year.
You should start to propose them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of blood removal of cordon as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't have access to you," because Hema-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Calcium - The Impact in semifinal
The Impact Montreal qualified for the semi-final of the A series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive match of the quarter final, at Saputo Stadium.
The centrocampista Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first-time goalless from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino marked the subsequent networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Let's remember that at the first round-trip game, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in semifinal.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunderler completed a first 3-1 in the return match winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In brief - Decisive Network of Kovalev
The Canadian and its axes are ready to start again the season.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive game phase by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, marked a goal, made two steps, and picked up a passage for victory, in the fourth of the Hab preparatory games.
The only Kovalev network to win.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to strangle in the first period, he noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the game's success.
There was a great ovation."
Charest tip north
The Prime Minister shall not exclude the opening of elections before the end of the year.
After concluding the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon yesterday, in Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to be elected during the part-elections today.
"Enlarge the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday to Levis, by means of instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Mulin to images".
On three maxi screens, they confused spectacular negative hydroelectric dams, mining, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means as in the full election campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister also refused to exclude the launch of the autumn elections, even though he noted that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North- the northern territory to the 49th parallel- was never the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but it has not spoken about timing or investment quotas, as it has not explained exactly what priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
All the more, he simply pointed out what he believes deserves is a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to the list drawn by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "great territory twice as much as France" is here, it is Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he is insistent on us," he insisted, as if he wanted to solicit a national founder myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the gold fever in Abitibi, the national engineering, the James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has specified the prime minister during the press conference.
"It's a traditionally maintained position by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time and, when the opportunity is presented, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
Moreover, "in view of climate change, it is necessary to reassess the North," he said, speaking of the passage of the north-west, which will be open throughout the year because of the meltdown of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty."
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of Ungava PQ), have already given way to the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) occupies an important role, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will provide common visions"
The development of the North would embrace the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "coordinated, ordered and respected the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded it.
"As the Liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed that the Beauharnois Centrale be renamed in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, in Lesage that nationalized hydroelectricity, in Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another reference, conservative this time, was made to John Diefenbaker's "Street to the North" programme, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Faced with the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest stated that its commission would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his militants, raising his applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who in April said there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not miss the opportunity to start a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stressed that he was certainly very committed, particularly in a mission of the Federal Council in China and in the Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided to the Liberal leader a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" which have passed away as oil: the PLQ calls above all for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the sketch of the North Plan was welcomed in a skeptical way.
PQ leader Pauline Marois repulsed the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not respect its application.
If he did, "we would be making progress today," commented Marois alongside Jean-Talon's candidate (scrutiny today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADA said it supported the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope for, is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," said the leader Sébastien Proulx, substitute for Mario Dumont, returning just today from the holidays.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
He was Vic Toews, former Minister of "Justice" (the irony of fate) of Harper's cabinet, to allow himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "marble" for Canada.
To dishonor in this way a woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a great deal about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have returned a citizen held in Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account at all the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time when the charges were made.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and lets a child-soldier cast into inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, invoke Omar Khadraffin's repatriation so that he can undergo a regular trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes before torture: it does little to him that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of misery.
We do not realize this yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of freedom and of "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop showing and that sounds so foolish on his lips.
Here we are when there is no more morals: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today minority (to see what will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
This is the shame, Mr. Toews, in renouncing all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world's largest auriferous company has filed a complaint for defamation of six million against three authors and a small barred publishing house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a complaint for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to its own.
Little matter the outcome of the process, the writers and the editor of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a massive sum of money in order to organize their defense and to fight, with decidedly unlearned weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the pockets practically without the bottom of the mining company.
Moreover, in these spare weapons struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that would undermine the opposition as well as to scare anyone who is speaking again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is first of all public opinion that should have presented its own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada usually take place with the exchange of opinions rather than with mannequins.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, documents, and to establish a genuine debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could have made light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and repudiates petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a public "debate" when his contempt for that same audience is obvious?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word only indicates the lawyers who are profunally paid and not the entire Canadian population; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Black does it first because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a sort of embalming (researching the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum to discourage them from suspending the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the complaint carried by Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and on the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to quote authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss issues that are uncomfortable with the richest businesses in the world, it is a great deal of pain, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific rules as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to his claims, he is not looking for a transparent debate at all.
This is for the benefit of the university world, as does the same public debate in Canada, and it is now the time for governments to take measures to limit abusive complaints.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the heads of the Congress, representatives of the republican and democratic movement, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest Saviour-Financial Plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new US$700 billion plan version, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: checks on its actual implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of cases for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection of remuneration paid to the managers of the protected companies.
The US Secretary to Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, inestimable discomforts and disturbances would have been poured out on the everyday lives of the Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The time limit granted was the opening of the markets this morning.
While the two candidates for the U.S. Presidents later joined the negotiations, they were rather in favour of the agreement, however, not to express their discontent before the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama is worthy of having added some provisions to the agreement, in particular that which will enable the owners to maintain their home and that relating to remuneration for the managers of companies covered by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to be glad about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he'll vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"By what I've read, it's something that we all need to digest and that will allow us to move on"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to repurchasing with taxpayers' money the doubts, assets at risk and invincibles of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of mortgage credit at risk (many) , then to extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and to lead to the freezing of liquidity and the ban on banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge to air the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have come out of that blind alley since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" asset of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone at the Congress, a provision was added that, if the government was to face losses over the course of the five years due to this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will receive shares in the protected companies that will be divided in the event of profit and that will be able to resell when the waters have calmed down.
In accordance with the plan, the federal government will have the possibility to delay the application procedures for real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and starting allowances paid to the managers of the undertakings involved.
From now on, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the Chamber of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is still not sure that they will be given the freeway to their plan.
There were, in fact, several votes against the project yesterday, both at the republican and democratic deployment.
"Of course, Washington does not feel you," he declared addressing his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Chamber's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of taxpayers..
Leader of a small group at the so-called "Caucus des sceptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe once again saw evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would have renounced the purchase of its competitor, in full failure after the loss of €2 billion (US$2.9 billion) for the crisis of venture real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is one of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It's none of the lost money," said the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, there is influence and right to vote in banking matters.
It's certainly something that savers and families now appreciate that the times are announcing uncertainty"
During this period, at the other end of the Manica, the British government seems to be nationalizing another billiard bank for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would be responsible for all of the loans currently under way at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander made it known yesterday that you will be buying the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was for a long time its axis in the sleeve, for others its weak spot.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the sick smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
What a constant!
Paul Newman, disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last American cinema icons of the years before.
Brando's less monumental, which he resembled and of which he has long been a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he bears the voice of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Magical children are often born from mixed couples.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, by German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the last brand of quality.
Since he recognized himself as a whole country occupied by the safe made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, proud in the fight, that in the early 1950s he studied dramatic art at Yale, later frequented the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing at theatre, on television and soon at cinema.
That same militant man for civil rights was also the motor driver who ranked according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
If you go with him the shadow areas of a reserved, discreet, committed, allergic star to the scandals of show-business, of which you will never be able to reveal the mystery completely.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a dip in the heart for the cinephiles, while his great characters pop up the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is re-proposed through its interpretations.
In memory, the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy(1969) and that boy unable to desire the hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La catta on the roof that hatched adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him in the cloths of the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep as promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, a delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lassu someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, who officially launched Newman in 1956.
That evil cute in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Lo Spaccone, Robert Rossen's magnificent film (1961), Martin Scorsese's money color, which was valued in 1987 by him the only oscar on 9 appointments.
That face over the years, it was hers.
Again.
Epochs happen through its path.
Young people know him above all for George Roy Hill's dry cult Slap Shot-Copo, in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, brothers and sisters Coen.
The circle had ended with one last step as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in my father's era in 2003.
Unlike the most popular movie legends that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will remain in the halls, denouncing Hollywood throughout its close-up, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French filmmaker, called it, with an irony point, "a living challenge to the underplay", judging his performance.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholized carrots or desperate ones, of which he expressed his blunder and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, sensibility.
The first time of Jennifer, 1968 (based on the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, she drew a subtle portrait of the melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the numerous rainy tributes yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old fellow weapon Robert Redford (who had recited together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness" His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, an objector of Hollywood drift, turns away.
We will have ripped her face off on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, though born as gag.
However, the revenue from those sales was destined for its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of clinging to his myth, chose to engage to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter saying " Always and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege."
And the same privilege was for us to follow the path of such a clean and generous American artist.
Citizens model, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & member invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and its members will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in an association to delinquent that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Procurator, the money obtained from contest notices was used by them for private purposes, and often certified the carrying out of the activities by means of false invoices.
State and municipal money, a total of 65 million guilders, has ended in part in the boxes of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, reported by the investigating authorities, they have collected the money obtained from competition notices on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment most of the invoices were false.
In order to do so, the invoice blocks were purchased in the Józsefváros market, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on which to issue the invoices, it was established among other things during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for consumption, on the model of these were then prepared the invoices to be submitted to competition notices, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the City of Budapest.
Much of these are the work of István Lados and András , which, according to our information, has drawn up mainly the reports needed to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "study trip" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and members in 2003, the restaurant has provided meals for a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurant, would not all go into the room together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövěért Foundation, later called Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, a bundle of formal and content errors.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, but in the invoice there were 130 guests.
But the inventors of the invoices full of fantasy exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., too, it deals with catering, in whose accounts - according to the information given to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövěért and Hoppá.
The company's administrator, Mr Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned in the prosecution and showed him the invoices, he came to understand that these were false documents.
"On stamp the name and the Iva game of our company were at a wrong point."
He added: In addition to the formal reasons, there was not even the fact that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
Once again, the bill was served and their restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The assistant invoice compilers did not worry to inform themselves that the travel agency in Budapest from their choice, organizes only trips abroad, so they were foolishly indicated on the bill with payment in cash trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
Moreover, as shown during the investigation, Iva was also included in the invoice, while travel to countries outside the European Union is free of Iva.
Among other things, the amount of Iva was wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Revifülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövěért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company, it is necessary to apply Iva at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition the staff of the hotel issued only printed invoices, while the invoice was written by hand.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as activity carried out the carriage of goods by road, as is known from the procedure of the Prosecutor, activities that were not carried out by the company founded originally for investment advice.
Moreover for formal defects - cause unconformed invoice format, false stamp - it has been discovered that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évesredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers have not even paid attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, which is precisely why the company's liquidator, according to our information, refused to issue that invoice.
They've sent invoices knowingly
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták in favour of the foundation Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million guilders.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of the Collab Kft to issue fictitious invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and members of the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for about 5 million guilders to the Jobb Jövěért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyě Egyesület association, after which there was no real economic activity.
Not even money movement because the invoices prepared were then backed up, but the associations forgot to put this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong to those who are connected with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to report to the Director General of the Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not found there, who deals with fuel trade and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million guilders.
According to the data from the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The Director-General of this company was a Romanian to which Ivan Kubatov would forward the company documents between 2002 and 2005.
As we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian muralists founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of them were operational, because according to the defendant they had not been given a job.
In any event, companies have become useful because, at the request of the co-employed lawyer Zsolt Szente, the editor of the company's founding documents, invoices have been issued on behalf of the companies to the associations related to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov released to the various 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million guilders.
The claim considers that Kubatov has affected 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition notice.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarszágért in January 2006 presented a call for the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the bando.
So that this doesn't come to the branch, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of Arpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants, as they have already done in tender, will probably report on the progress of the production of invoices.
However the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, János Zuschlag, decided to raise the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and even if he has promised to speak more often about everything in an extended way, he has not yet done so.
We need to see if it is in your interest, it could also be that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million guilders, much of the damage - would be willing to do the despatch.
Zuschlag could also be offended by the fact that his demands for relief from his prison conditions, that is, the granting of house arrests, have so far not been heard.
While the authors of non-refundable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of auctioning in excess: why spend more money?
Buyers' auctions are willing to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and researchers from the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study on Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a race like eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
The research tried to trace the nervous scheme of this "participation" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players took part in a auction while with the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body strangulated under the cerebral cortex comes into operation intensively when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to the other functions, plays a role in the self-gratification mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the price rise is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the strato.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group carried out a financial follow-up survey.
In this investigation three groups have appealed against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported the actual value of the product in question and made their bet.
Another group besides this promised that in the event of a win they will receive another $15 prize.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the group members would have lost their money in the event of auction loss.
The difference between the two groups consisted of the fact that for one of them the pay has been highlighted, while for the other the loss.
Checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group who played "against the loss" were willing to make higher bets of the control group or "winner".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, these so far explained the phenomena found in auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schutter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to speak to your doctor?
Nearly half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, in Hungary instead of the first causes of death, chronic liver diseases are mentioned.
In Hungary, the number of patients with hepatitis amounts to one hundred thousand, of whom only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of the contagious liver disease caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical of hepatitis and itteritis, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms according to the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
For travellers it is useful to vaccinate against virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after the consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellow spots are formed on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the dark urine, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is, according to estimates, that only one person in ten receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not cured it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subdly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since also a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease, it is worth addressing your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognised in time the disease is treatable, the virus can be eliminated by the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumours can be prevented.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who does believe in God feel less pain?
According to the result of a recent survey religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, communicated the British Telegraph.
Within the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while everyone observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
On the basis of the results, the Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the University participate as well as academics.
The test was done exactly like this: a tool that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to concentrate on two paintings, the virgin Mary painted in the seventeenth century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the hermelin of Leonardo da Vinci painted in the fifteenth century.
The authors of the exam hoped that the image of the virgin Mary originated a sort of religious state among the believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because he did not differ too much from the other and considered it to be of reassuring effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time area received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care" of them and "they calmed down and were pervading by peace".
Looking at the image with religious themes, they found 12% less pain than when Leonardo's work was before him.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image from the strong effect even for atheists, however, you need to find the appropriate image.
"We need to look for an image to which there are very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it manages to change our personality." - added Wright.
After the excellent results remain the question only if the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself
On the tenth birthday Google can claim to be in the pockets of people as well as in the sky above their heads; he knows where they spent their holidays, what outpatients they attend and what interests him.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, is not enough yet.
On the other hand, the sceptics who compare with the Orwellian nightmare do not see exactly the substance of web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as many personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to meet the Google founders' original goal that it was: "We put all the information in a system of the world!".
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: would he like if Google knew how to answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would the job be suitable for me?", but the software doesn't know how to answer apparently simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all netizens are aware that during their Internet searches exactly the words sought, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested are stopped after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago users can store their browsing history, they can affect what they have searched and clicked, they will then long be producing much better tailor-made results; on this same logic we base Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our previously declared preferences and registered.
What if my data are used against me, if you look at what I'm dealing with? - worry users of Google's data monopoly are asked.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of the internalized are caused by fear of the size of potential power represented by the company, not by the sense of guilt, by fear of punishment, by desire for freedom or even by rebellion to power.
One fact is, however, confirmed, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such cases there is no defence of the personal rights of the residents.
The most striking example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google has forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that has made possible the identification of pedophiles from the page of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
Inmates concerned about personal rights instead have been relieved in May when the firm - in agreement with the EFF Association of Electronic Legal Protection - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: even later, Google cannot be forced to provide any information requested by the FBI at any point in the constitution.
(At the same time the federal government successfully ripped up nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand expressions of research obtained in relation to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years before, but still failed to obtain individual user search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data Google because they believe that thus their intimate sphere and private life is being compromised by starting to use their services and rise up with the rebellion of the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferate of fans, activists and computer users appearing in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as world conqueror because of Windows, as both fight for the same objective.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for their services, the source code kept always up-to-date and the program package is much more accessible, young and cool than the official software colossus practice.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, which implies just one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
The web 2.0 only talks about collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communicative channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young media can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm listing its musical tastes, all of which can be included in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which your most recent photo galleries automatically appear stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read many exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common circle of friends, comes to know easily with whom she spent the night her little boy or a firm can fire an employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the business summit: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now has completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life are able to show themselves and thus we can formulate the fundamental thesis that is hidden behind the behavior of young people.
Who wants to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do it (e.g. starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time leaving no tracks voluntarily).
There are not few people who do not register on purpose on community pages to be found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and the collection of news, can be replaced with alternative versions not related to huge server parks and that do not make up our best existing profile so far.
Public opinion waits even so secretly for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time, instead, cause major harm not only to Microsoft but also to many software development firms.
However, critical observers next to all of this find alarming points: the company summit, for example, has completely refused to protest employees after doubling the company's asylum law, has considered the repeated daily food service of employees too costly, but this declines in view of the fact that in 2006 Google has brought the head to the Chinese government and, according to their agreement, the company will filter all the results that offer the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years will move the world to one point: while some believe that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines will assume such proportions that the company will soon be in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled account of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be alarmingly approached.
Two minor years helped Ozd's double homicide to make the tracks disappear
The police questioned two minors about Ózd's double murder, suspected of having helped to make the traces of the crime disappear - the spokesman for the Borsod Region Police Survey said Tuesday.
Young people have recognized the crime they are charged with, and are currently being accused of favour.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on their own.
Favoring is punishable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man in the place, was placed in pretrial detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of premeditated pluri-micide committed for profit.
Since the survey, the young twenty-three had a huge debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, for this reason last Wednesday attracted with a deception his creditor at a yard in Ózd where he killed him and his daughter nine years old.
According to MTI's information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a signal is that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange stock list.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the advanced offer by the Poles despite the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell in a few months more than 60% of its securities.
Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have presented an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all interested the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Land Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has occurred thanks to the American President - he accuses La Repubblica - who has not been able to compact his party behind a fully absorbed law, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second September 11th.
A part of the press in Madrid also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership in America has thrown the world economy over the edge of the ocean.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing ever more, and the world will suffer later.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress's vote, there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the most transformation of the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to remove the threat - mentions the Tags-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifesaver to the financial institutions boating and with taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then they will no longer be sufficient financial means or new improvised solutions.
In the long term it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and to concentrate control on the broken financial markets.
Only on Monday, weakened financial institutions have obtained more than EUR 100 billion - recalls the Vienna Der Standard, according to which anxiety seems increasingly real that even European taxpayers, like Americans, will have to put their hands on their own portfolio to remedy the crisis.
So far the EU has not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "savators" should not immediately blow up the EUR 100 billion, however it would be better if they determined in which case taxpayers' money should be touched to prevent larger damage.
The smart car imitates the flight of the skull
What could be the best way to develop anti-collation technologies if you do not imitate the sensors of the obstacles that are in nature?
For example, bees.
In the amazing project presented to CEATEC in Japan, calabrons gave the initial strategic direction to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collation systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a robotic mini car provided with bee properties, with the ultimate purpose of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really resembles our protective shield - explained to the Kazuhiro Two exhibition, director of PR technology and research and development.
Important is the role of the ape view, capable of a visual of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers have attracted the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the ape view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within 180 degrees radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the ape, changes direction immediately turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, takes place completely instinctively.
"If it weren't so, the robot auto wouldn't react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful and internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in an eyebeat.
But unlike bees, deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of wheel slenderness.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as available possibility, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, lighter and with a high energy density, which means that their duration is greater than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the existence of intelligent reaction is important, not data processing or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so use only a memory of a few tens of Kb.
There's no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions which, according to Nissan, can be installed on serial vehicles within 10 years.
Further possibilities of application can be represented by unification with GPS satellite navigation system that avoids obstacles on the road leads to destination.
They also found the expensive child's name.
The written version of the $700 billion economic saving law for the purchase of disproportionate credits has been drafted, to be applied in several parts.
In the first passage, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements protracted until midnight on Saturday according to the time of the Eastern Coast Congress leaders decided the 700 billion dollar rescue plan after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have taken serious steps forward - said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the House of American Representatives, who only left to put the agreement on paper.
Both the presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The Treasury Minister Henry Paulson, speaking of the result of the compromise, said: the program will work and it will be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, it is not about the rescue of Wall Street but about the investment of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 o'clock in Washington (2 a.m. on Monday night according to the time of Central Europe), but did not bring about a great increase in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the project defined Economic Stabilization Act 2008 concerning the program, after touching the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, then welcomed the news of the agreement to the White House with joy.
We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesperson of the White House.
The programme, however, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which provided that the $700 billion would be spent all on the purchase of securities with loans disproportionate to the back.
Now as a first step you will be able to spend at most half the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of Congress, with these the Ministry of Treasury will purchase securities with credits disproportionate to the back, of the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the programme to which the President of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the law, the Ministry of Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "vene" credits.
Purchasing can take place via auctions and directly - they have announced that they are competent in the ministry.
The legal standard makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means of concern, for which companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damage.
Henz Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means to ensure that 700 billion dollars will come for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the necessary steps to get us ready to introduce the law just signed - it has added.
Bank managers in crisis and awaiting state aid believe instead that the government will limit their welcome, defined by the overseas slang, simply as gold parachutes.
Limitations on payments will only occur in some cases, but also limitations depend on how the Ministry of Treasury will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry acquires under a auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if it does not retire the deceased bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not overstated.
In addition, the existing contracts for gold parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of general administrators - the Democratic Barney Frank President of the Committee responsible for the financial services of the Chamber of Representatives has commented on the measure.
In addition, the State has the right to take advantage of a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also gain if the economy, and together with it the bank saved, will stand up.
The bill includes that in the next five years the President must submit to Congress a proposal which provides how to repay the expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course from both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, not defend taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
Your Democratic colleague of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by themselves who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The prices of paper production, editorial and typographical activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the area of electricity supply, gas, steam and water prices increased in August of 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, first of all as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas carried out by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, given the domestic sales of the sectors of the manufacturing industry, the largest increases in the production of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of products derived from metal processing, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco represented a decisive weight.
A decrease in prices occurred in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.3%).

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that the US-Hungarian visa-exemption agreement could enter into force on 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke of this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion "all now depends on the fact of the Southern Ocean is built in time the electronic system of input and control".
However, he drew attention to the fact that there will no longer be an entry permit in the new system, but prior to departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will deliver the medal of the Order Cross of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will meet with the foreign policy advisors of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two great American parties, guaranteed their support on Sunday for the 700 billion dollar government plan for bank rescue, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
The representatives of Congress and the administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, on Sunday night they announced that they had concluded an agreement of principle on the plan to rescue the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial release package from the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suitable for their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys by putting the economic issues at the forefront Obama has again recovered a bit of advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Vice-President Sarah Palin, has dissipated.
Obama in a speech to Detroit expressed the hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion bill on the floor.
He pointed out that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps which have also been supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
Don't let McCain's economic ideas get out of the way.
McCain in an interview with the ABC explained that "everyone we're going to send down this situation with difficulty (...) but not doing nothing is a way to go."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no merit in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would probably vote for the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole on the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more aware - thus analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet edition of the left German magazine, in the article Bavarian Revolution devours his parents analyze the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU has already begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple came into office.
Christians-socials have modernized Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of the whole of Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was just ten years ago was realized: it ended the indisputable hegemony of a party-state.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 still during the period of the much mentioned Stoiber.
This is the result of modernisation in the region, which devours parents.
Sociologists have predicted it 40 years ago, but they have been very wrong about time. However, secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing possibilities and the political consequences of this are evident.
The pole on the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in the last few weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: the free professionals, the craftsmen, the diplomats and the graduates.
Support for CSU has fallen below 40% here.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
The conservative newspaper of Vienna "Who with whom?" In the article "Party Presidents are stuck in coalition matters" deals with the confusing domestic political situation created by the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the intervention of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections were made, now rotates everything around the coalition; in the debate broadcast by the public TV party leaders just showed the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to deal with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of ÖVP, as vice-cancellier.
As you have stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course has been rejected in any case.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Mosterr reacted prudently to red offers.
As you said, collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to get involved in ÖVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still open in the party, the issues should be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ has repeated to be opened in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to assume responsibility for governing us," said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began in Paris, organized this year by France having the Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party Fidesz in the message addressed to the plenary as the principal rapporteur of the congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and thus the most serious obstacle to their assertion.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla, responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, opened the conference to the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were the governments, the European social partners and representatives of the major civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Parliamentary Group, pointed out, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, that Roma are expelled from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have the title of a middle-level study and as a result of elementary education of bad quality only an unusual number of them can achieve a higher degree of study."
Járóka has also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in enforcing human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these links more widely known in the area of Roma and non-Roman.
As soon as the school starts a Roma, the more its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are increased, through taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregation schools," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the union of European Union's purpose and action is necessary to accelerate the process of school segregation and therefore it is of fundamental importance to comply with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, we must give Roma children the opportunities given by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens in full respect of the future of Europe," Járóka asked.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized each year, from the meeting in Berlin last year is to ensure a unique forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at both the state and European levels.
CSU: piety for a transitional period
At the end of October you will decide the fate of the packaged Huber-Beckstein couple.
Despite the bad electoral defeat the heads have not yet fallen, at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been postponed for the moment the discussion of personal issues.
The president of the party Erwin Huber and the regional governor Günther Beckstein remain in their place, the question is until the moment of pity.
The fate of the tandem that has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary convention of the party in the last weekend of October.
The two highly critical politicians have indicated in any case that they are not attacked with all the forces in the chair.
They thus tried to soften the angry subscribers of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the "Bavarian Tosunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under Edmund Stoiber's leadership, at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union had 60.7%, now after the coup d'état against Stoiber fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to coerce in any way.
As the first sign of the reorganisation within the party the vice-president and federal minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the small exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Electors exponent values on the right for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of the Free Electors, Gabriel Pauli, whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treated the woman without regard to the great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to stabilize in some way Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also have an active role, which so far was in the shadow. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be a Chancellor after the Bundestag elections set for September 2009 if the CSU which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory will not be set up with common forces.
According to Merkel, that does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of CSU land will not adversely affect the great Berlin coalition.
Certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, the crisis of social democrats, however, still lasts.
The SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after the elections on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead explains with the brolios made in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 persons in a country of 10 million has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition collected under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) was seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional change to the 2006 elections in circumstances discussed, "concession" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus renounced a boycott previously assessed.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter for the Belarusian political situation considered anti-democratic.
It referred to a distention that the OSCE, by assessing the electoral campaign, placed the emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the prohibition to appear for a third of the opposition candidates.
The OSCE's rapid Monday report, however, also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
In spite of this opposition, an improvement in the political climate is perceived: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared for a small confrontation with Moscow and continues to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state, considers the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said to our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the opposition to the 2006 elections, it is desirable that it remains despite the fact that "the power has been afraid to bring even one opponent into a non-weighted Parliament".
The opposition does not include protest actions for the results, but rather tries to get voters to the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have a lot of problems, we need to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but I also see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - Milinkevich said by referring to the fact that even the more officially aided estate, that of the pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime to be suitable, which considers its main result the creation of social security.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in economic deficit it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security "reministered by sepulcral silence" - Milinkevich says.
On the contrary of the opposition policy, the Russian observers have judged elections democratically.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Community Independent States told the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were rotating doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But since today, he's taking this new measure against the sneakers, against who stamps and then he's going to have a coffee at the bar at work time.
The anti-fannuloni news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services" the minister says.
"Now we open a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta points out.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no resistance from the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It has been a process shared by the workers and there has been the collaboration of all".
I mean, no more breakfast at work time; no more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 am is a holy hand."
During a conference at the School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the absences for public employees' illness have reduced by 50%, that is, 60 thousand more people at work in one year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make public administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - the minister explains - have been double in the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have joined together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today banner numbers about the least absenteeism at work because of illness - writes the consumer association - the people of 'operious fannullions' is constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of employees in Italy of the correct and productive public administration who have joined together to declare war to the illegitimate standards contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatments for sick workers dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the hours of repertoire of the sick worker, within which inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Work Incidences, Napolitano: "Crime Prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur on the job, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, the Inail data confirm that the white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths from homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic events of these days confirm how crucial the question of work prevention is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association Mutilated and Disabled of Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses his appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention at work, the protection of the unfortunate workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of the public.
"It has, of course, raised an outrage 'basta', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their size, provoke the cry of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality reproposes dramatic cases, even recurring in their dynamics."
Napolitan does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In particular, they take on the many initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness on the part of young people who look at the world of work.
It is important to keep the focus on the phenomenon alive, not to fade into the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
The President of Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all the institutions a firm commitment to bring them to an end urgently".
"Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive development, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from still impressive," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not, in fact, want this "downward trend" to translate into less attention, because it is just when attention slows down that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that there is still too little going on at general level to counter the phenomenon of accidents and that the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our view - Mercandelli has stressed - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as far as communication and awareness of public opinion is concerned.
But, above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility from employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection for the victims of work" and the "difficulty assistance towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who are unfortunate should not depend on spontaneousism or extension from time to time arranged by the legislator."
Mp3 readers under charge, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a prolonged period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission refers to, which in a press release in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Emerging Health Risks recently identified (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day keeping the high volume device risks a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at high sound levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - the EU leader continues - there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most, we need to sensitize consumers and make this information public domain.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the widespread use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they had originated.
"Scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical equipment and related equipment."
Currently, there is already a European security standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources are growing.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as reduction of levels and duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue notes that users of portable musical equipment listen to high-volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limits on maximum noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would cover 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today we begin, in March it closes, in June we will get the money.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which was set up this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop guidelines for Rome.
Once the drums are closed in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bell" of the Campidoglio and its Mayor Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all the political, social and cultural ideas - it aims to stress German - it will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome, of which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the municipal Council, will then be able to take advantage.
There is no overlap of roles but only the desire to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then he will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, since its opinions will not be binding, German reply: "It all depends on the work that will be able to do the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Too often the policy crushes on the day-to-day management and on the emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look further and longer, from a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome points out that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary nor a body: it is absolutely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a euro and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences that the Capital expresses."
For German, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which it has absolutely needed, thinking with a united spirit to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the only present municipal boundaries but will look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
He wrote a well-known American politician that wants us to go independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, made the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date draws near.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big torch face: he thinks he will win the highest office of a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will it be a good president? Yet there are polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
In this case too, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the south of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the voting booth, we know well who will vote for the American patriot.
It comes out on one side of the American mentality kept covered up to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether on Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: If Obama is to win, we're going away from America.
Things you've never said before, which almost certainly looks like the black candidate's success.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kicks in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak spot.
Whoever will take over George W will have a huge task to do.
U.S., the economic shock also makes you feel on journalists: in newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the internet, "killer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by the POW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for US journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a broken-down economic model crisis.
Furthermore, cuttings in the newsroom, in the hall where the editors work to put together the newspapers, is a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want traditional journalism as the general public intends to do.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the US journalist today.
You're on ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the national newspaper is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open a gap to the Internet, for many views like the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it "dos something good" for their journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is among those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some it has to do with "working safety".
Executives who think they're losing their jobs around 3 years are at 47% at national level.
For the staff reporters it goes to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, tv and internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can also earn $10,000 a month, as well as pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to arrive at 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROMA, DANILLO COPOLA RESTAURANCE
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the appeal of the realist Danilo Coppola who had asked to move out of his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppolo shall be investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Counterpath Survey on Unipol-Bnl climbing.
In the course of the trial, last week, she obtained the discharge from the households transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate owner to travel from the province town to a residence in the capital.
However, according to the court, these movements (which it has given an opinion contrary to the pm) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that they accuse him of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already occurred a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 billion dollar rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation of yesterday's New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is breaking down the Republican Party, increasingly divided among its old, moderate East Coast soul, in favor of the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "the Washington ones" and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, by the way, that became pre-eminently alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
However, this just mentioned is just an example of the changes, major changes, that the economic earthquake in progress perhaps pre-announces or has already been noticed: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not here alone.
Both in the US and in Europe the crisis seems to work as an accelerator for incubation phenomena for a long time and in the new climate are solidifying and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary relaunch, of the dual category State-Soveranity in relation to a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, very close links with abroad, but which at first see the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems largely out of play or not to have much to say: the clear evidence is given by the European Union which is divided as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies cannot decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when you arrive at the narrow it is only the States that own economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in the sixth.
They also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which no market and no international organisation can possibly have similar resources.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the status-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely related to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial technology, while we were convinced that globalised finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized from a point of view that our future will have to do accounts to an increasing extent with those very little immaterial things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look at a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another on the earth but are nevertheless bound entirely to a confined space, to a territory.
As for those who are sovereign, they certainly have several more cards than those who are not, those who have the misfortune to live in a place without crops, no oil and no water.
I'm coming to the second news, but it's about a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective requires authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discreetness for existing leadership, economic species, has become so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And together something even deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discreet, an insuffrence, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of countries in the West.
That is to say, it seems to be becoming more and more common in many sectors of the population, the belief that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites as they have so far been, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, that they have made their own time and that they are increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branchy but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political arrangements, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolts" elections or in the sudden movements of collective moods of these last and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of laborers' consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
It has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and thus represent, what is not taking shape today in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis revives, increases, shakes potentially in disparity.
In the face of all this talking about a "mass rebellion" on the agenda would be quite frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The supercolla to walk on the walls
Defeat gravity laws thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close.
With a sticker of only 2.5 centimeters square the scholars managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gechi, covered by microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "takes easily off the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
CAMMINING YOUR MURI? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat conductors and electric current.
Other applications could cover aerospace engineering.
At the moment, you won't get over it.
The OTHER RESERCA – Berkeley University, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented a microfibre adhesive as hair that self-cleans themselves from dust during the movement on a surface to maintain always a perfect grip.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juices
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are destants and rich in vitamins, if they are taken at the same time with some life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness depending on the case with even serious health consequences.
Reiterating the risks of fruit juices both packaged and fresh associated with the taking of certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: it is enough a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some lifesaving drugs, cancel the beneficial effects and put patients' health at risk.
The grapefruit juice was already indicted because it is considered responsible for increasing up to levels considered toxic the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antistamine and neurological medicinal products.
FARMACI A RISCHIO - The Italian Medicine Agency itself had reported it in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mix and to take care of what you drink if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"These findings are generally reported to the various agencies of the international and national drug that may make it possible to change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear, don't make us impress but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification", the expert pointed out to the Agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Yorker who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days of the failure of Enron, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that triggered not a few controversy and that for years was refaced to the economist, but that has now proved true.
"I am surprised and also somewhat shocked at the speed with which the memories of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive "very aggressive" style, particularly critical against the excessive libertism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of OpenOffice.org release 3.0, the open-source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work from voluntary developers, whose shoulders are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows up to the general public with different news: the welcome screen and the revised interface and makes it less spartan, adding more substantial ones such as the native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also put to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite Open Office is able to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as that which allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them via email, or the possibility to import PDF files into the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical graphics of Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with multiple hands between different users, avoiding the conflicts on changes, in the text maker, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks should release the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version on the mirrors since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation CD can also be shipped at home or at work.
And if the theme of freeness can be a draw for the spread in houses, it is precisely in business that Open Office the suite tries the great bet, and it can already count on several projects realized in public administration and schools.
And there is no lack of reality that offers an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding videowriting of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the emulated presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the databases; Draw, finally, is the graphic module.
The objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the projected figure.
Even Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positive to the latest Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third graded and winner of the best climber mesh.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
On the 26th year Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl's blood samples is among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and meet the two years of canonical qualifications.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity at the Third Generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press of having notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26th-year-old Austrian placed himself on the final podium behind the Spanish-speaking Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also awarding the polka shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRATION:NEW YORK TIMES AND CHECK, IS ITALY A RAZZIST?
Italy "from the country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" accepted reluctantly.
This is turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? This is what is asked in a long article the New York Times that devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support to the North League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation required by the League which tightens the barriers to immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal people is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trend highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Diorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of car rentals up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for university students does not know about crisis.
According to the latest investigation of Sunia, the rent union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to the point of excluding whole groups of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so distorted the market to trigger a process of generalized increase for residents as well."
In the majority of cases, rental offers also contain a number of violations: contracts of a free type, not registered, without the limit of a canon, connected sub-rents.
For Sunia there is a need for extraordinary interventions which, through the revision of tax taxation, can reduce prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed place in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Vittoria area).
In Florence a sleeping place costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on areas near the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed place, from 370 to 500 for a single one.
In Rome in areas near central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas near the other universities (Ostiense and Cinematà).
It saves only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed place and 450 a single one in Prenestina, Cinderella and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed place it takes 300/450 euros, for a room it spends from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed place it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities where rents for extra-Community students, such as Perugia, are most frequent, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon asked for foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, cities cancel historic halls
Historical cinemas close in favour of multiplexes.
"A city without cinematographic halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore captures effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the great multiplicals and the consequent death by constipation of monosals in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us inelutable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and memory loads," it's as if there's less a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and many emotions," says the director of New Cinema Paradiso, the film that 20 years ago added to Tornatore the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prix of Cannes Jury, and which told the poetry of a province hall and nostalgia for a way to live the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the exhibitors, speak clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and to pay for the major scotto are mainly the salts in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 single-sala movies, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisala cinemas: 195 extra screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed unreasonably" notes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures but it would have to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its hosts are willing to move into the multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund in favour of operators: the government's prior debt is around 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not comply with existing laws.
In order to support the sector, it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, has decided to run to the shelters with the signature of a protocol between the Town and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote the cinemas monosala both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the rules laid down are tax relief measures in favour of managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators can enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for stopping and parking.
"It's an initiative I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to contrast the ripple of the multiplex the traditional salts must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradise", to which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, there where I have experienced many shared emotions, not to see the signs buried from the dust I turn to the other side".
Links between politics and 'dragheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the Commune's choices to the interests of the Piromalli hull."
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the anti-mafia Directorate of Calabria address the mayor and vice-syndacus of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in Mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his lawyer nephew, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for association to commit mafia print, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In contempt for any legal and moral rule, as well as common sense," wrote the prosecutors, the two local authorities had expressed the desire to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"So it would have been granted to the cosca - they write the judges - to enter officially within the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already large, of control and of the public administration's address."
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loireo does not hide that "collections between local authorities and organized malavita are several of them" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'dragheta, heroes who keep themselves clean".
The arrests of this day follow those of July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli shell.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged preconditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved by the task of administering the Commune.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, was elected to the head of a middle-right coalition, after the dance of May 2006.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of archiving everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this week, explain that the Piromalli shell had even come to ask for the variation of the project of the A3.
From the environmental intercepts ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pm, "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group notoriously close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones go down in the field.
It is an extinct deposit, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the major global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now they try to lay their hands, colossal like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the sea's movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the environmental instances and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea-wave motorcycle exploitation plants.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Colosseum to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, who in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are becoming more and more and between these companies that have always voted on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technologies on oceanic energy - he has declared the spokesperson of a company associated with the U.S. oil colossus to the Wall Street Journal economic daily - and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is not recently signaled, especially if it is considered that in Alaska the U.S. continue to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new twinnings.
In addition to Chevron there is the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the energy road that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, as far as it is not known in the details, indicate to the observers a rising interest.
Technology to be developed.
The experts talk about technology still at dawn, even because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major ecosystem problems.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies must be used with greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of oxen connected with each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the oxen up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure drives a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
For now there are four plants of this type under design, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping centre and a parking space using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said she has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves at this time the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely about the energy of the tides that were like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others facing the coast, have already invested $7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million in 2009.
