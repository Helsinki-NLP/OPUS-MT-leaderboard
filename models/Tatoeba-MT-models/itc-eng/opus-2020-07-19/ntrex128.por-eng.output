Members of the Wales Assembly are afraid of "passing by Marretas"
There is a consternation on the part of some Members of the Wales Assembly (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Galish Parliament Members).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the Assembly's name for "Galish Parliament".
Some members of this House, coming from all political colors, are afraid that this will make them fall into ridicule.
A Labour AM said that the group is concerned about the fact that "the designation to row with Twp and Pwp".
For non-galese readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrements".
An AM of Plaid stated that the group in its globality "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative Member said that the group was of "open mind" with regard to the name amendment, but said that MWP's designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name amendments, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the House are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave its House powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which recorded widespread support for the proposal to designate the House as the "Galish Parliament".
On the issue of the title of the AM, the Commission supported "Galish Parliament Members", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AM are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring together the consensus may constitute a headache for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to the way the House exercises its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the committee system.
When discussing legislation, the AM will have the final word on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer to the change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change of their country's name to "the Republic of Macedonia of the North".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with neighbouring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long stressed that its neighbour's name constitutes a complaint about its territory, repeatedly challenging its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposition to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name amendment is no more than the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
Sinos of St. Martin are silent at a time when the churches of Harlem fight for survival
"In a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
"People socialize differently," he said today.
"The bars have stopped being the living rooms in the neighborhood where people turn regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned about the possibility of the money I earn with the sale of wealth not to last as long as the leaders expect" and that sooner or later everything will return to the point of departure."
The churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not give support to the shrines of the remaining neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and, therefore, this will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation left here in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was then set up by a black congregation that held its worship in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the shopkeepers of 125th Street, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson’s parishioners ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, father Johnson's son and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the "poor's bosoms".
The specialist who played the trolley in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and a "unreplaceable historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also reported that he was the first trolley in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the largest trolley in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "procurate to pass on the costs", poor degree of not having been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tubaro causes 13-year-old injuries in a lobster hunting dive in California
One shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunting dive in California, on the first day of the lobster season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as soon as he heard the boy scream for help, then finishing in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just about enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The whole area of the clavicle was dilacerated, Hammel described what he observed when he got to the boy.
"I screamed everyone out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical status.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Point Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the United Kingdom cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections in the style of the big warehouses, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain a share in the United Kingdom cosmetics market, evaluated at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow while the sales of fashion clothing and items to the home recant, these major sections of cosmetics will be tested in 11 shops spread by the country and will be implemented in more shops in the coming year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the search by supermarkets for ways to use exposure space previously used for TVs, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its beauty product catalog with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand-like areas like those of Boots stores.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its range of Boutique make-up so that most products obey the vegan precepts, something more and more required by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London last week. It is expected that the second one, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, opens near the end of the year.
Online shopping and the change of eating habits for small daily quantities in nearby shops led to supermarkets now having to work harder to persuade customers to visit their shops.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores are becoming more and more like large warehouses, at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos sales outlets in hundreds of shops, having also installed a series of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and states that this has strengthened the sales of commodity products and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The company's earlier attempt to renew its cosmetic and pharmacy departments ended up in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues of health products stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy arises after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its pharmacy business with 281 sales points to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores an extended range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the aspect and essence of our cosmetics sections into a more pleasant environment for our customers.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our range of brands has been designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones "dangerous" after Holly Willoughby left business of £11 million
Peter Jones, Dragons Den's star, became "furicious" after the TV presentationer Holly Willoughby abandoned a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of household articles and Truly accessories.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Plaintow.
This Morning's presenter, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she was going to abandon the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the Star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones freed by leaving the lucrative brand in the last minute to focus on his new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "sudden" when the golden girl on TV admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business (which worth up to £1.5 million), implied that he would no longer have time to dedicate to his home brand and Truly accessories.
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Ptoutrew and expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was going to leave Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: "Truly was by far the greatest of Holly's priorities.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long term and would be a financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave has left everyone absolutely astonished.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of articles ready to sell at Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that the exit of the presenter of This Morning, who is among the most lucrative stars in Britain, can cost millions to the company, given the extensive investment in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household articles, and the potential for further delays in the launch.
In addition, it may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the project as president in March.
Couples make vacations together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presentationer for I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we do not intend to comment on his business."
Hard conversation "and then we fell in love"
The president of the United States, in a jolly way, mentioned the criticism that he would be the target of the media by making a comment that some would consider "indignified by a president" and by revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so often?
Trump said, in his pretended voice of "telejournal pop. "
"I didn't give up on anything."
He said that Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, pointing out that it would be a major step in the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearisation are in the process.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response " from the US to the first steps towards the disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in his speech at the concert.
"He's running very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
Trump said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the deadly remnants of U.S. military.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when he spoke in relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this super-lotted arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia causes devastation on an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
In the heat of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was told to the foreign non-governmental organizations that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population in Lombok had been displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international aid channelling.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was clear that they are not asking for international help; that is why it becomes a little difficult," Mrs Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson of the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether it would be permitted for international agencies to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant tremors of land suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-equipped for the wraths of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, shelters against tsunamis are not commonly seen on other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a series of tsunami alarms in Palu, a poor degree of the existence of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, travelling among the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital-ship parked in Lombok to treat the victims of earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the place of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made the improvement of the infrastructure decrepita a central part of his election campaign, spent huge amounts on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has left Mr Joko's executive behind, at a time when he faces his re-election in the coming year.
The president is also being pressured by the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows, and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge do Liverpool makes a long finish for the goal of tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal on the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's ballad, with his team losing for 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making a finish towards the second beam.
In an attempt, the ball flew high over the large area by turning to the upper right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrazabalaga in flight and fell inside the network.
"I was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are advancing as much as possible, so I was just winning as much time as possible," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won 1-0 at the interval after marking a goal in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this play, the advance of the blues gave a heel pass back to Mateo Kovacic before taking off near the middle of the camp and performing a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
Then he made a beautiful finish that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the great area.
This crossed the defenses and made the goal against the network of the second trave with a finish with the left foot that passed through the Alisson Becker network of Liverpool.
Liverpool faces Naples at the Champions League stage on the third afternoon of Wednesday, San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europe League on three Thursday afternoons in London.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, declared the country's disaster response agency at the beginning of Sunday.
There are reports describing a large number of people imprisoned in the ruins of buildings that occurred during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached the 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, agency spokesman, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was covered with the debris of the buildings that broke down.

The statue of Cromwell of Parliament has become the most recent monument swallowed by the content of "historical revisionism"
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, which reminds the Taliban, of so many cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's figure next to the Westminster Palace would become a target to slaughter.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's authorship, is a testimony from the 19th century's opinion and from historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes an entirely precise description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the 17th-century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents one side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and celebration."
Pig killer attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southwest China market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his name "Yuan", was found dead, with an artery cut and covered with blood, close to a pocilga in the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, read at the South China Morning Post of Sunday.
The pig grower prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig crop on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, you will have traveled with the cousin from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door for an open little neighbor.
In that pucilga, I said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 kilograms, had attacked the pig until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed, said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security cameras show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed their pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking other people while the police were collecting evidence at the scene of the occurrence.
Reports state that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of attacks from pigs have already been reported to humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal.
After a Oregon crop has been eaten by its pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as "stemule".
"They're just kidding.
They like to charm, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them due respect," he said.
Desquisitions of Hurricane Rosa should bring heavy rain to the south-west of the United States
As expected, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the entire Mexican north and to the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
At 5:00 a.m., Eastern Time of Sunday, the Rosa caused 137 km/h raids, a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it begins to take shape a depression on the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the US. As it approaches the peninsula of Baja California, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity toward the north in the southwest area of the USA.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that may reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce strong rains widespread in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause sudden dangerous floods, engulfed by debris and possibly landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5-7 mm in the spot, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm precipitation is expected in southwest areas, especially on large part of Arizona.
Sudden floods with rapidly worsening conditions are possible because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly uncomfortable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Strong precipitation can cause the passersby to turn into brave rivers and the thunderbolts will bring strong, sharp, cloudy winds of dust.
The approaching depression will bring with it strong precipitation on parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitations of more than 12 mm are possible, which can cause small injured debris and slippery roads.
This could be the first precipitation of the wet season in the region.
There will be some scattered tropical caves in Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered at the end of Monday and on the Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread at the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until fourth.
The month of October can record strong changes in temperature throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools. However, tropical areas will remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
There is an excellent example of drastic temperature differences throughout the central area of the US on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, in Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
It is expected that much of the Central and Eastern Zone of the USA will have a hot start of October, with general temperatures ranging from 27 to 30 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above the average.
Our forecast of time for the long term indicates a high probability of the occurrence of temperatures above average in the eastern U.S. zone by the end of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people attended the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people attended six television stations yesterday to the rapist Brett Kavanaugh testimony, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly happened in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute revolution: an agreement developed by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh beat her as drunk and tried to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, who were told by Nielsen on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of other stations that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulties in measuring audiences from those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, it is a level of audiences similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's appointment, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
Then comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, referred to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that its vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was seized by the chambers of CNN and CBS on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters when he tried to enter an elevator to attend a hearing of the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained motionless to look down on the ground while he was directly criticized for CNN's cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake stated that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission went to the vote to make the nomination of Kavanaugh continue for a vote in plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake said she would only do it in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee during the next week, which the Democratic minority had come to demand.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by the FBI about the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politicizing" with Brexit
The Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of his plans to leave the European Union of "politicising" with the future of Great Britain and of undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack to what is known as the "Checkers Plan" of the Minister for Brexit, claiming that a proposal that provides that Britain and the EU cover the other party's rates is "totally absurd".
Wayde murder Sims: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson from the death of LSU player
Police arrested a murder suspect from Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and charged with murder in second degree, according to the Department of Baton Rouge Police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered them at the scene of the occurrence and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had fatally hit Wayde with a firearm.
A bail of USD 350 000 was established, the lawyer said.
The medical-legal office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head stretching to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the authorities in the area for their "duty and effort to obtain justice".
Sims was 20.
This advanced, 1,98 m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 highlights per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devasted" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"This is what concerns us in permanence," said Wade.
Vulcan eject ashes in Mexico City
Ashs emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in a 24-hour space.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social networks showed fine layers of ashes covering the para-brisas of automobiles in neighborhoods of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
The geophysicals recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometres from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook the central Mexico area in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Confrontations between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protesters and intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan referendum polarizer on the secession.
A group of masked separatists, locked by intervention police, hit it with eggs and threw ink in powder, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which the police resorted to sticks to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups that sang "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist demonstrators, who shouted "Long life for Spain".
Fourteen people have been treated with mild injuries suffered in protests, you can read in the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October that was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence overwhelmingly, although the influx to the polls had been low, with a majority boycott against them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the ongoing vote on voting tables scattered by the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
The independent groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support to the national police.
Although performed, this manifestation was forced to take a different path.
Narciss Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we lived our best moments.
I saw my parents cry joyfully for voting, but now we are blocked," he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have had difficulties in maintaining the momentum this year, with their leaders most known in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting judgment for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his cell phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been holding trial since last year, announced that he would apply to the European Parliament in the next year's elections.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: arrested men after car crashing into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly fought in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred at the gates and in the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may also have shot a beast against the car.
Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory against Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston secured the victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, startled Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as a technician of the Hebox club.
The attack by Dolly Menga made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changed level, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which continues without a win out of the house in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders, with eight more points on the next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at the Europa League at home on Thursday.
However, Livingston has extended to six games its succession of undefeated confrontations in the division, with Principal Coach Holt without losing a single time since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against paralyzed visitors
Holt's team should have moved ahead on the marker long before the goal, because the incisive character of his game was causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but let himself crawl in front of the ball and then Alan Lithgow managed only to direct his effort away after he had sneaked to find Craig Halkett's head on the ball.
The house team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing she could cause trouble to visitors in the ball games stop.
And that's how the crucial goal came to be.
The Rangers granted a free pass and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At that point, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced a defense of the impenetrable house team, and the network guard Liam Kelly didn't have great problems.
This pattern continued in part two, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers' network guard Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another liveston stop ball game.
There were still crossings for the large Livingston area, which were successively resolved, and two complaints of great penalty, one after Halkett's investment on the Glenn Middleton substitute and another after one hand, were refused by the arbitrator.
Livingston "femenal" - analysis
Alaskar Lamont, BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to overcome expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His style of play and the staff have changed little since his return to the great teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving their maximum throughout the game.
Anyway, Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team was much below these standards.
Its final play was uninspired (only once they were able to open the house team), constituting a kind of warning to the Rangers, which lies in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, whose aim was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved topics such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed their presence in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, have also been heard, condemning both the President's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies on a collision with a car
A cyclist died on a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southwest of the city, close to 10:15, British summer time.
The driver stopped and an interview relief team, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This collision occurs months after the death of another cyclist on an escape collision on Childers Street, about a kilometer and a half of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform his family.
Barriers and deviations were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Wounded in Disorders
Six prison officers were injured in disturbances in a high-security male prison, said the Prison Office.
The disturbances, which still continue, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 0930, British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents "Tourned" were called to resolve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to a wing.
The agents received treatment of small facial injuries on site.
A spokesperson for the Prison Services said: "They have been used specially trained teams to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it must be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden of the prison had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were called to resolve a serious disorder in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threat Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the areas affected by drought can benefit)
It is rare a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but it is exactly what is expected for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane crosses the Southeast Desert, involving the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday, to the south and eastern areas of Nevada, to the south of California and to Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that the Rosa will take a direct trajectory about Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching at the end of Monday with rains.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression in a 300 km radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from Arizona border".
The most recent models of the National Furacions Center provide 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Bay, can receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of total isolates that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden floods, the rain of the Rose may constitute a blessing, because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most serious category," said the siteweather.com.
First, hurricane Rosa will reach the continental mass through the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected that it will reach the coastal area in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Strong precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"The total precipitation is expected from 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with maximum possible 25 mm," said the siteweather.com.
Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of rose or its remains is the very high precipitation at Baja California, north-west of Sonora, and in the south-west US Desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains produce sudden floods of debris in the deserts, at risk of life, and floods in mountainous lands.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected homicide after a 16-year-old boy was found with cutting gun wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, close to 4:00, British summer time on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area, reported to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have called on everyone who can have mobile footage of the events.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh "was the victim of the Democratic Party's wickedness and anger"
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for rejection of the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a concert in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump reported that Kavanaugh "was a victim of the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, having strongly and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and courage that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum," said the multitude of supporters of West Virginia.
The president later mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of republican influx to the polls in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, CNN said a main deputy to the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported on Saturday the authorities.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high bumped into the beach in the late afternoon, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred following an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of the success," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesperson to reduce the effect of the Indonesian catastrophes (BNPB) in a communication in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't move alone: it dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, deformed and slaughtered bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Indonesia Technology (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the enormous wave of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, is read in the declaration.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have disbursed.
The bodies of some imprisoned victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and the damage can be deeper along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area with the name Domugaa, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally incapacitated and there was no information" about Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film released on social networks, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for people in the street below.
In a space of minutes, a water wall fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm immediately the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power cut that interrupted communications in the area of Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jacarta and other cities. However, the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo visited the evacuation centers of Palau on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia increases exponentially to over 800.
It's very bad.
Although he managed to get safely to the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, the staff of the World Vision of Dongala went through scenes of devastation on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the aid groups began to undertake the grim tasks of assistance to the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and foreign personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared as "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still in a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arrani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"The way the government says "OK, this is a national catastrophe" we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist."
On the fall of the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the still missing still kept the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigate the dark blankets of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been stuck in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing sportsmen for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagei, were his students.
"As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during automatic cash replenishment in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's official who was replenishing an automatic box in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was emptying an automatic box in the fun complex and preparing to introduce more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While I was busy, another man "came up running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects running away from the site, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police through number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper renames Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name--for Ye.
When announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former being known by Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, received Ye's nanny for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its participation in the Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled it by "emotional motives", informed the creator of the show.
At the same time being an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has for it a religious meaning, according to West.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, when he commented the title of his album with the Big Boy Radio Presenter.
"Therefore, I am you, I am us, it is us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the only one", to only Ye - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is another reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers that have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyfen and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO commits not to resort to military attacks against civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador committed not to use military force against civilians at a time when the country was approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Military fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that could have risen to 300, when left-wing student movements settled throughout Latin America.
López Obrador undertook to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open up more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
USA should double the financing of artificial intelligence
At a time when China strengthens its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the research expenditure in this field, said the investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments occur after several U.S. government departments have made AI-related announcements, although the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the subject.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
"Duplicating the AI research budget would be a good start, since all other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new AI revolution," Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the chances of the next great success of AI being achieved by the United States, Lee referred to NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked in an AI system that defeated the best-classed American player in Othello. He later performed executive functions in Microsoft Research and was president of Google’s branch in China.
Lee credited the U.S. government's previous technological contests as the Robotics Challenge of the Department of Defense Agency for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
US researchers often have to make a great effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired luminaries from universities to work in AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to give impetus to its efforts in the field of AI.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to doctors in AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Chinese Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to finance researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners in industry and the academic environment, and the White House announced the formation of the restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion on an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation designed to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not moved forward months ago.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to "the Republic of Macedonia of the North", an initiative that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece that blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that its neighbour's name in the north represents a complaint about its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but the nationalist opponents argued that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the population of Macedonia, mostly Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the voter turnout would be sufficient to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: "Is it in favour of entry into NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the efforts of admission to bodies with the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Dr. Olivera Georgijska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The national election committee stated that there were no irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the influx was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters came to vote.
"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a capital elector, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of the country's name, which would open the doors for his accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and for the EU, but we want to stick up and not for the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don't want to receive us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that entry into NATO will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving their vote.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a value lower than the required fluency.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia, found that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the influx must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major disarray in the policy of the pro-Western government since it took possession in May of last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City crosses all the Brighton defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling forgot Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory against Manchester City on Saturday, Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I guess it made him look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The advanced Argentine received a midfield pass at the beginning of the game.
It made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
It ended a defense before neutralizing in the race more within the limits of the great Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced English used its first touch in the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan’s netguard with a straight end to the network.
"Aguero is arguing with some problems on his feet," said journalist Pep Guardiola, coach of the City.
"We said he'd play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had scored a goal at that moment."
But Sterling gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
That goal was marked at the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball right in Brighton's territory in that game.
He made a pass on the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling toward the second trave.
The advanced Sky Blues kicked the ball into the network immediately before sliding out of the limits of the field.
The City faces Hoffenheim at the Champions League at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make it hard for Rockies to live.
With the Nationals eliminated from the end, there were not many reasons to force another beginning.
However, the ever competitive Scherzer has hopes of entering the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the end for the Rockies, which holds a leadership of a game about the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their title of the first division.
"While we're playing for nothing, at least we can get into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the headline launcher for Sunday, but there are those who say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the releases in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, made a session at the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right player in Washington goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump performs debut in Western Virginia
The president later referred to the situation involving his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he mentioned the importance of republican influx in the interim elections.
"Everything we did is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running, and that's why I'm fighting for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "They're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, they're seeing it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using all the means necessary.
They don't care who they grow with, who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of "resisting and obstructing".
"And they have seen this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, evil, deaf and liars."
The President referred by the name Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to the public's hearings.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you cause the document to be leaked?
Hey, hey, what?
No, no, I, wait, one - that was a body language even bad - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censor me, it wasn't a surprise for me.
At the end of the day, I am the most recent of a number of Labour Members in Parliament to whom it has been said that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been subjected to similar treatment because he has resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar topics for which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting in the sixth quarter mentioned that "we intend meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately today, it is no longer the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of a "kinder and kinder" policy has been long forgotten, if ever it has come true.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by the leadership of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to take a turn and take positions with which he would never agree - whether they were on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public (and does not really matter what I say), there is a stream of insults on social networks that call for "depose", denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I must not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments I have made tend to be political.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back in front of them.
One of the things that disappoints me most in this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have stopped being inclusive, and with each motion of "censture" or amendment of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I have received numerous advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head low, not to be so expressive, and so "it would do all right" for me.
But that's not why I came to make politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party for 32 years as a student, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in rubble, I sought to fight for better public services for those who most need, either as autarch or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country goes to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But indeed, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "depose" or political files will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe are the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The imbatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late essays somehow sent out the result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved to win in this incredibly interesting game of the Tennent's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and a better risk management that made the house team take the best, and Coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and continue unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie do Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute essay, converted by Frazier Climo, placed the Ayr on the front, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was given to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, having Jason Baggot taken advantage of a non-converted essay.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before the middle season, it marked and then converted a solo test to place the marker nos 17-5 to the Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose began the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption was followed due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was transported from maca to the outside and, after the start, Ayr strengthened the leadership with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climus.
The master of Ayr in exercise, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with a non-converted essay by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure investment.
However, the house team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having knocked down Climo without the ball, in the launch of penalty, MacPherson put the ball on the floor behind the Maul in progress of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the reinstatement, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing to the fifth test of the house team.
Still Game Star ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems ready to enter the restaurant sector after knowing that he has been appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with the long-time comedian partner Greg Hemhill.
The couple announced that the ninth season, shooting soon, will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "florescent business of Glasgow restoration".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a country deprived of its coastline, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific.
Marines patrol a naval base covered with rope in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Getting it back is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a lost coastline for Chile is still alive in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point of decades, since Bolivia is awaiting an International Court of Justice sentence on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the delivery of TIJ's sentence on giant screens scattered by the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will act in favour of its country's complaint, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election in the coming year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," was the President's vote last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will act in favour of Bolivia, and that little would change even if not.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ sentence is given only six months after hearing the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have hurt it.
"The question of access to the sea was kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric threatened some Chilean residual good-will, suggested.
At one time in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, even one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
" Bolivia will never deprive of its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must overcome the past."
North Korea claims that there will be no disarmament without the country trusting the US
North Korea's Foreign Affairs Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never spare its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises they made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments arise when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy in impasse, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong One.
Ri mentioned that it is an "impossible dream" to consider that the continued sanctions and the US objection to a statement that puts a final point in the Korean war will ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first significant step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and the US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a widespread skepticism about Pyongyang having really intended to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion parades in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to extend your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of extravagant and oversized hats to their 2019 spring-summer collections, which amazed the style set in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the walkway.
Valentino's most prominent piece was an extravagant bege hat adorned with a broad glove similar to a pen that flooded the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included trimmings of jewelry, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks... same as carnival time.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high seam.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue with this immense fashion statement, you're lucky.
The stylistic observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of the "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm tab that has been used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very impractical hat that spread through the social networks sent another great creation to the paddles: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the model in fact the bathroom that transported it.
The burning orange-colored raffia bag, adorned with raffia strips and with a white leather glue, was the most prominent piece of the spring-summer collection La Riviera 2019 from Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm waiting to see big hats and beach bags coming to the shops next summer. Since the designer had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to obtain the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to deepen their studies and access to universities, as well as to the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a custom school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can enter his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart."
This quote reminds us that we cannot depend solely on English when we intend to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of recent exams this year, we found that the languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of utilization of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum A classification.
These data, collected at the 74 schools under the height of the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained the maximum score of A in manderim, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favoring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and not only.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons why employers had difficulty in filling vacancies, 17% had to do with the lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to demand language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, the French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio of 15%.
So investing now in language teaching is important for children today.
The domain of a number of languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children the best chance to find jobs with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the United Kingdom by the 2020 horizon, such as the mandarim or the Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose in independent schools, supported by teaching staff specialized in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the necessary skills for success, regardless of what the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance to the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting's over for fans who want to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Laker Coach, announced that James will participate in the opening game of the pre-time of Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48, said Walton on the official site of the Lakers.
Laker journalist Mike Trudell published a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training early this week, James was questioned about his plans for the schedule of six Lakers games in the pre-time period.
"I don't need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's YouTube startup time and channel in Western Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a round of campaigning concerts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled concerts for the next week, which include stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the pending vote of conformation for your chosen for the Supreme Court strike, Trump intends to strengthen support for the interim elections to be held shortly, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's debut in Western Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's debut in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's concert on Western Virginia online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably address the hearings this week to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The confirmation vote provided for in the Senate will be pending for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this stream of concerts is to help the Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to gain some momentum.
So, leaders of President Trump's campaign stated that these five concerts next week aim "to give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is as fundamental to the President's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible, as we approach the turmoil of the campaign season," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign that he gave up being quoted, told Reuters.
Marked for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the soon-to-night concert can attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the media in Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Western Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates it has strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, the ants from Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of the impetus is a totally invented sports concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where did they say the impetus will come now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so we're looking at that as a little bit of momentum, I would say," said Jordan Spieth while he was leaving the camp at the end of the day.
Europe is in benefit, of course, with four points ahead and more twelve at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them achieved three points in four.
Spieth has been deadly from tea to green and is leading by example.
Those gourd screams were becoming higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth match an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the match on the 15th produced in a similar scream, that guy who reveals that he still believes that the American team continues in the competition.
"It is only necessary that we concentrate and worry about our own game," said Spieth.
That's all the rest of each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, is four in four and cannot go wrong.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but it also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and on the back nine on Friday morning.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, it consolidates the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory by the sun in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
I would rather, both at the same time in different holes.
However, the speech on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero this morning, when on team with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the nine front fucked the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there's no one to help them get out of him.
The fourballs and the foursomes are so fascinating to see closely due to the interactions between the partners, the advice they give or not, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better on the team so far and has gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursome session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the struggle that some, especially in the United States, doubted it had.
Europe with a leadership of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last day of Ryder Cup with a strike advantage after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday's departures with a 10-6 leadership in front of the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty to arrive at the four-point classification in the Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, fighting to preserve the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series for 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes with two winning matches, but failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12-day singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to earn four points followed when he and Molinari, who received the "Molliwood" nickname after a sensational weekend, are only the only duet to earn four points in their four opening matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they reinforced the advantage over the top, defeating an energyless Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged on during two matches on Saturday, revealed occasional access to genius, but has already lost 19 of the matches he fought in fourballs and foursomes, and seven followed.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the forsome, defeating by 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze to the southwest of Paris, Europe has not always brought the best.
Jordan Spieth, three times winner of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a 2&1 brave victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the forsome, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team invested a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although Furyk's team, holder of the title, only needs to tie to keep the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "no thought" to unilateral disarmament without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions was exacerbating the mistrust of the United States and that there was no form of the country unilaterally dispensed with its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant good-will measures" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing centre and the commitment not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"Contently, we see no corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way to proceed to our disarmament first."
Although Ri has recycled North Korean complaints already known about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, within which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, its statements appeared to be significant in so far as they did not reject unilateral denuclearization in contrast to Pyongyang's earlier positions.
Ri reported a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a President of the US in exercise and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim committed to working towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the war in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang has first to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to soften the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, opposing itself to the "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that prolonged sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the US leader in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the party interested in this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this impasse".
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was drastically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that guiding North Korea rockets towards U.S. territory was inevitable after Mr. President Mau' Trump called Kim the "fogue man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened "to destroy completely" North Korea last year, filled Kim with praise for her courage to take steps towards disarmament, but stated that much was still to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a calendar for it, stating that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously until the denuclearisation is complete, final and verifiable."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006, in an attempt to strangle the financing of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then declared that he would visit Pyongyang again in the month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although then North Korea denounced him for "making demands of gangster.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States "take corresponding measures".
Pompeo stated that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they sought were Trump's security guarantees in Singapore, as well as initiatives towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course that teaches them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the machist culture of studying in "direct" impregnated with caffeine.
One teacher concluded that the students of this university at the top of the world ranking often did not have the slightest idea about the most basic concepts of care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes to be the first of his type in the USA.
The inspiration for the course emerged after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you just saying this to me in the last year of the course?"
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health services at the university, said that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, slippers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to collect to bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the health effects of smoking option," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "direct making" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes it a growing problem.
To ensure that we sleep sufficiently and with quality should be a "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight loss, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in mode of hunger, constantly making them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the whole campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program of studies before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm for the time to go to bed, as to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: goal of Menga overthrows Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another access to sadness outside the house when the attack by Dolly Menga caused Steven Gerrard's disarticulate team a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
Hebox's team was trying to record its first victory in its course since the 1-0 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up striking Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the collective of the Rangers, without inspiration, never seemed able to equal.
With Rangers now going down to the sixth position, Livingston goes up to the third, and just behind the Hibernian for the difference of tastes.
And there may be even more problems for Rangers after the Calum Spence line attorney has received treatment of a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that exceeded the Ayr in the mid-finals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, used the same eleven Livingston who stole one point from Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with the way his well-oiled team suffocated the opponents in each game.
Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored at two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's ballad, but the average missed his great opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed to just finish out towards the second gang.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game in the third end.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been granted a great penalty to the quarter of an hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson refused Colombian appeals.
The Rangers achieved only two finals at the ballast in the first part, but the old network guard of the Hebox Liam Kelly had little to worry about the end of Lassana Coulibaly's head and the weak end of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's goal at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, no matter how tenacity.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle a long-standing Jacobs ballplay.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the range, having replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and this exchange had almost immediate impact when the lateral advanced moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the lock.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett performing long-term pass past long pass.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, again claimed a great penalty when he emranned in Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: On September 30, 1882, it is today 136 years old and continues to count ... it was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the Count Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like a uranium.

New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its modification in the laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its modification in the laboratory to "see" a protein common to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then injected again into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including those of breast, ovary, lungs and colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach that involves removing immune cells from patients and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a Trump-support diatribe with a MAGA hat after its appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West went to the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which he praised the President of the United States, Donald Trump, claiming that he would apply for the presidential elections in 2020.
After performing his evening song, with the name of Ghost Town, in which a hat "Make America Great" was enlarged, he started a fight against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white man and he says, "How can you like Trump?
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have abandoned America for a long time," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star broke out Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been transmitted, the scene of West's bout was published on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to rip off West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a lot of time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They intimidated me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying that "I put my superman coat, because that means that nobody tells me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments provoked public talk and the SNL participants appeared to be ashamed, he reported to Variety, having someone from the program told the newspaper: "All the studio was completely quiet."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the execution of Perrier's I Love it bottle disguise.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "One of our most courageous spirits: OBLIGATED BY ENFRENTERS TOURBA".
However, the interviewer Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying that West was simply "to be what it is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (purchasing his music or supporting his "art") who I believe to be welcoming and spreading harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming it was now "the being previously known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following the passage of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg also used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing music legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known to Prince".
Accusation of attempted homicide after sfading in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to be presented to the Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public ministry.
Kit Harington's Warstar attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a grismist like Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, War of Thrones.
However, the actor, aged 31, attacked the stereotype of the machist hero, claiming that such roles on the screen make boys often feel that they have to be hard to respect.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit mentioned that he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Rose Leslie Throne War, also 31 years old, admitted that he has a "oughly strong position" on the approach to the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position, right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we're witnessing now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they must belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequelas or sequelae of the War of the Thrones when the series ended next summer, referring to the end of the "fields of battle and the horses".
From November, Kit will participate in a True West edition of Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of the character of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series awarded with Emmys.
The couple gave the knot in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% leap in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, the health authorities said.
About 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies estimated that, due to conservative values in the country, 70 to 90% of men who had sexual intercourse with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters unraveling information about Republican Senators by his collaborator and attacks "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
The US Congressman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of your team would have published personal information from three U.S. Senate members on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the accusations were promoted by opinion leaders and "ultrarighte" websites.
"Talks, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the houses of the homes and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published the data of a Waters staff member, reported The Hill.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leaking information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This liar is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not your responsibility, he cannot be angry.
You can't have a challenging position.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
You must reveal calm and serenity."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction with the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will compete for Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," read on your tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally held responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Johnny English Criticism Back to Attack - weak spy movie parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is fashionable now to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and this seems to apply to the new edition in the series of comic films and action Johnny English, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satire on the subject of being so bad is the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his blindfolded eyes and an expression excessively elastic, got his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, which is a comprehensive comical creation for non-English film.
He is, of course, the idiot secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a bit of Mr. Bean's pitted and something of that guy who contributed with a single note to the theme of the film "Momentos de Gloria" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games 2012.
In addition, his character was originally based on the international mysterious traveler and man whose role Atkinson played on TV ads to Barclaycard, who left the chaos on his track.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approached a helicopter with a medieval armor, with the rotor's shovels making a short noise of rail against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that the editions of "serious" films such as the 007 and the Impossible Mission now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We keep the idea that humor is addressed to children and not to adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre misfortunes are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in a serious trouble.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground for the inconvenience of the service agent, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pomposous and conflicting figure, to suffer already a total breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for great flights.
Your secret services advisors inform you that, once all the agents on the asset are committed, you will have to get someone out of the reform.
And this person is the untrained Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a chic school, but giving unofficial lessons about how to be an infiltrated spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us an academy of spies in the style of the film "School of Rock".
English is taken quickly to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his suffering auxiliary Bough, role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, a snoring character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin from the catastrophe in His Majesty's Secret Service are back to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously fascinated by the billionaire charismatic technologies that claim to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd, disastrous acts: disguised as table workers, lit a prominent French restaurant, created confusion by penetrating as clandestine in the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English triggered pure anarchy as it tried to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize itself with the inside of the home of Volta.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but however nicer and more time-consuming that is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And just as in Johnny English's other films, I couldn't stop questioning: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to do justice to his talent?
Workers disprove that they are generating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be weighing a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day workweek, but with five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to review savings with the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) for the workers, granting them an additional day of strike.
The workers would get a weekend of three days, but maintaining the order.
Sources refer to the idea of "adjusting" the economic programme of the party, which redirects the country for workers.
The passage to a four-day working week obtained the favorable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from day to day, but a four-day work week is an aspiration adjusted to the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy for the worker, as well as the overall strategy of the party for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is currently not favored by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson of the party said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
The finance minister shadowed John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power from the hands of the "faceless directors" and the "speculators" of the basic service companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the full share of current water companies shareholders, since the Labour Party may carry out "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell has also confirmed plans to place workers on the board of directors of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which may embolde dividends to 500 pounds each year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if the FBI investigation to Kavanaugh can make them or not change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions as to whether the findings could lead Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I was going to the audience, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when this claim appeared, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, determined, unequivocal."
However, Graham's vote seems unmovable.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be necessary," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous disappointment," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything changing again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a list of extremely impressive stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in the Central Park Grand Revue, not only to attend such events as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the real goal of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defense group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a phone call or any other significant forms that helped to increase awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "cliquetivism" - do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who exerted pressure to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to the world's leaders to announce commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion of those already disbursed or accrued.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom bringing together investors and implementers committed to "help children reach their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country. This after having received more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote to history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5000 actions of pressure on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the site's frequent questions, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It's been a long and crooked way - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, just like the great movements by civil and anti-apartheid rights that have been before us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists who will be performing this year's event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use the Navy as a "block" to put a barrier to Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary," Washington may resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular, where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to broker energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly to the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group entitled "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, saying that they are indeed the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, leverage and replace fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "magic single trick" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, the Trump administration authorities, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inadequate" North Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stated that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, aims to double the existing capacity for 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated for economic reasons, as an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will deeply analyze" the possibility of applying for presidency in 2020, said Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that "he will deeply analyze" the possibility of applying for the presidency to follow the mid-term elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and this includes a woman as the ultimate manager," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will look deeply into the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren commented President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying that "I was taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a hard vocal critic of Trump and his appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey carried out on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's own constituents do not believe that it should apply for the presidency in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts's "probable" voters stated that the senator should not apply, according to the survey of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Centre.
32% give their support to your application.
The survey revealed greater support for an application by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party discussed regarding a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's post-traumatic stress at a Donald Trump concert
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what's going on after he's back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually coming back," said the public at a concert in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and claimed that his son and other veterans "turn a little different, get back hardened, wondering if there is such respect, so that his comrades soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman and gun possession as an alcoholic, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district sent a statement friendly curiae (Friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is contesting this policy, referred to NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in Grace vs. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against politics was not revealed.
The person said that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang", abused her, but the U.S. authorities denied his asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The public ministries supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as nations that face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigrant Resources which allowed immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General Karl Racine stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle", read the statement amius curiae.
The lawyers also argued in this statement that the prohibition by the police of the entry of immigrants negatively affects the US economy, stating that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "available the necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," Sessions said in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of deaths doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, mother of a male febrile baby, comforting him in an evacuation center in the razed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their soaked water belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to the strong replications that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I believe," said Haris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "ads of propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's pay supplement at Des Moines Register, the most dramatic newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the 6 November elections to Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was attempting to interfere in the US elections marked the beginning of what the US authorities, in declarations to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting an ever-increasing trade war which both sides have seen applying tariff vacancies on imports of the other.
China's retaliation rates in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American specialists say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farmers and American companies.
China has written Branstad in an opinion paper at Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now putting foot in the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and of the press by publishing a paid announcement at Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"In contrast, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have of the worrying economic trajectory of their country, because the media are under firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters before the inter-calar elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend the appointed Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this may trigger a negative reaction, particularly to women, during the mid-term elections to take place shortly.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have said publicly that they want to move forward to a vote.
These things don't back off," said The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute (Republican of Arizona) pressure to conduct an FBI investigation is sufficient to appease the rebels.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is at the door!" when they manifested themselves in the Senate's hall, as the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the records," said the news site Stu Rothenberg, political analyst without party affiliation.
"People say it's already tall; it's true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among indecisive voters in suburban areas and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the appointed Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
"This has become a trap for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take over his place as a judge. It's also about how Republicans dealt with the matter and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the USA Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, to the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first one.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of the respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford took an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her as an alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the man appointed to the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs when the two participated in a party during the period during which they were both studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The most recent project of this technology legendary character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's Open Source Platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jockeyed that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said regarding startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online data storage", or POD.
This may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about the personal storage of online data is that it is up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal ability through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteering programmers.
Beginning this week, world-wide technology creators can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not talking to the "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all your business models are turned from day to day.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a publication on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even as Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: tribute to the pastor decorated with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergyman of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his Christmas city over 100 years.
Lieutenant-Coronel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren dropped a memorial plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brillably symbolic" that the plate had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that he gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Coronel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable and machine guns".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and beating three soldiers of the detachment.
Lieutenant-Coronel Vann was killed by a German franco-attractor on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know he would never be equal, but also a lesson in humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts agreed all night to see Bellator 206 attend instead to the Porca Peppa
Imagine this: it is agreed all night to see Bellator 206, full of stars and, in the end, it is prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 combats, with six of the main group, and was being displayed live during the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the spectators in the United Kingdom were amazed when the coverage changed to Pig Peppa.
Some did not get impressed after they had been awake until early in the morning especially for combat.
A fan on Twitter described the change to cartoons for children as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"The government regulations say that the content is not suitable for six o'clock in the morning, so they had to change to another programming," said Dave Schwartz, managing director with the furry of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Porca," yes."
The President of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that it will correct the transmission schedule to include the United Kingdom’s viewers in the future.
"I think, when I think of repetition, I think we can solve the problem," said Coker.
"But it's six Sunday morning there and we can't solve it until our Sunday hour, which is Monday in British Time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and no very nice.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed the expectations of fans and we exaggerated.
It's a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" about his sexuality
The Olympic divers Tom Daley said that he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that he gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he got into high school that "they're not all like me."
In an interview with Radio 4's First Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had expressed support for the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the program's long-term regular presentationer, took a several-month strike due to illness.
Appearing as a paria in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" to everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me power and strength to achieve success."
His goal was to prove that he was "someone," he said, not to let everyone down when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and has used his participation in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The world champion said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Daley got married last year with the Oscar winner, 20 years older, although he claimed that the age difference has never been a problem.
"When we pass so much when we are so young" - their first participation in the Olympic Games was at the age of 14 and the father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who's gone through similar heights and lows.
The couple had a son last June, called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all that mattered was "get a gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Your son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you that "you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and got a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of the whole life: to dive in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games...there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, from Heather Small - with which he had identified himself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs passes on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m., British summer time.
Mickelson down in shape at the bank at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when he fights his 47th match on a Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the milestone from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the 12th time, a record of participations, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has often been in the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the main male championships divided the day between the supporter function and the work in his game in the field, hoping to rectify what afflicts him.
Never having hit the most upright even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the ideal for the Le Golf National camp, where the long rush usually punishes the wrong spots.
And if the field itself wasn't intimidating enough, Mickelson, on the ninth start of Sunday, will face the exact British champion Open Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches by them this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage to start the 12 single matches, have a good start, Miccelson's departure can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could assert much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a respected champion who gave a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't seen him playing two games.
I thought more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to go on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass on Sunday Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of matches played on Ryder Cup.
This can mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that never matched the successes of your individual curriculum.
Miccellson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and witty, he likes to play with people and he's an excellent person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives more than just to play."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage may disappear in a peak
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that his leadership, when entering the last single day at Ryder Cup, can easily become an accident.
The Danish had its debut in the start of 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seven Ballesters held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the nose with the narrowest of the margins, winning by 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," Bjorn said, in the image, after attending the victory of the 2018 Tourma for 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead by 10-5 in the National Golf.
So, the story has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go ahead and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I have always said that I concentrate on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enchanted with the performance of its players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead with it myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow, what matters is individual performance and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're going to leave the partner and he has to go and do the best of himself too."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will ensure that his players perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these great revolts on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe pulled the "Milagre in Medina" from the carton.
"I remember all the words," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important departures tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start as what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medina.
When this impulse turns to one side, the pressure is very large in these middle sections.
We organized our effective accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIllroy in the main part, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the ordering.
"I chose this group of players by this order because I believe it covers the whole route," Bjorn said about his choices for singles.
New German warship again postponed
The most recent frigate of the German Navy should have entered the service in 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War time. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to failures and an exponential growth cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the nouvelles nouvelles of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems threatened the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the navy had ordered in 2007 will serve to replace the aged Bremen class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, in addition to a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealing technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance, which would allow the latest frigates to be sent on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have led the warships of the last generation, considered as a way for Germany to project power beyond borders, will already be out of date when they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, returning it to the shipyards of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the yard after the delivery.
Little is known about the motives of the return, but the German media cite a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, since vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the quota required in the oldest Bremen class frigates.
It was also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the marine's ability to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-tonnes Rheinland-Pfalz has twice the weight of ships of similar classes used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion, an increase to the initial budget of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems facing the most recent frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German Defence Parliamentary Committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem grew exponentially over time, because older ships were put out of service without any vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had been able to join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
New investigations are being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands in order to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for food.
It is expected that the results will focus some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and fruit, as well as chestnuts of long ears and Daubenton bats in the Invewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations spread by the property to follow the bat activities throughout the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by specialists of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of calls from bats and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed image of its behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, an advisor to the conservation of the nature of the NTS, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grass-growing, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect dormitories and make habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning are also a threat, along with the flies and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given your night hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
It is for them to use a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly carry out studies, inspections at dorms and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, in the Thrave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The director of the estate, David Thompson, says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the bats we don't know, so the work we do here and in the other properties will help us to know more about what they need to bloom."
It highlighted the importance of checking whether there are bats before handling the properties, because the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
The bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, to sit them down, to disturb them or to destroy their dorms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the audience to participate to help.
It was said by her: "We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are taking revenge."
Ronaldo disproves accusations of rape when his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advanced Portuguese and Juventus selection was accused of violating an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is stated that you will then be paid $375 000 to keep the alleged victim silent about the accident, read at Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to its 142 million followers hours after disclosure of the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo characterized the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the winner of five Gold Balls to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on the allegations, which characterized as "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz stated that the player would require compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga have allegedly gone to the player's room, where the player has violated it annually, according to the documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that it was "99%" "a good type", damaged by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and had photographs of his injuries taken in a hospital, but that he later agreed to enter into an extrajudicial agreement because he felt "a terrorized by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The woman, aged 34, now claims that she intends to annul the agreement, because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian Juve giants in a business of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "Repend forever" of losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repend forever" if it lost its position as world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, said the Secretary for Greg Clark Companies.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told BBC that if Great Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the borders in the case of an unagreed Brexit could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My perspective is that if Great Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed concerns about the exit of the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said that it would close its Mining factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be the supply chain risks in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
Toyota's production line is managed on a just-in-time basis, with the parts reaching every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU, for cars manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom abandons the EU without an agreement on 29 March, disturbances may occur at the border, which the sector says can lead to delays and shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so the production would have to stop.
Clark stated that Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "calibrated precisely to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only the current success, but also the use by us of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers point out that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it was not possible to estimate the time off, Toyota reported that, in the long term, the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could, sooner or later, lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the United Union union in this place, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesperson stated that "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "awaited another week" given that there is still no understanding as to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia’s advisers and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump could be preparing for the Deputy Attorney General's dismissal, thereby putting Mueller's independence at risk, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, having information that he would be about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "I would rather not say goodbye" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a hearing by the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press advisor, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, it may be this week, but it may also be postponed another week, in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said that: "I wouldn't disagree with the fact that they like the protagonist."
He then realized that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We have examined these numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this often and they've seen that we've done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
Soil press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, he appeared in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way before the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service on Brexit’s fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter within six months of the EU's departure.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover applications for the status of EU citizens working in the decentralised public services of the country.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, and decisions were expected for this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want a lot to continue here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after headaches
The defense of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Aberchromie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after having suffered head injuries in the defeat of Saturday for 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, informed Mike Organ of the Tigers.
The coach of the Tennessee team, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He approached the lateral line and virtually fainted," Reed reported.
The technical team and medical personnel put Abercrombie oxygen on the lateral line before laying it on a maca and transporting it to a more in-depth evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended the studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five plaques on Saturday before leaving the game, which increases his total season to 18 plaques.
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers when purchasing properties in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party announced plans to charge a higher stamp tax to foreign buyers who acquired properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to homeless people
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate
The rise in the stamp tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
A higher rate of stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to homeless people, today will announce Theresa May.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises of providing more affordable accommodation and taxing higher incomes.
The rise in the stamp tax will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to boost the government's campaign to offer a roof to homeless people.
The overtax - added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second dwellings and lease purchases - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that the measure will allow up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, raising prices and making it difficult for first-rate buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy arises weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping the prices of the high estates when landing land that they do not use, demanding that Mrs May leave the quotas on the accessible dwellings to resolve the "disease of accommodation" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal for housing reform, including income controls and the end of "no justification" evictions.
It also wants to assign extended powers to municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not clear that it is as easy to buy home for people who live outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as for resident British workers.
For too many people the dream of being the owner of your house has become too distant and the shame of those who sleep on the retina continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
The coach at Sunderland Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is to become a selectr of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotch has been successful in the challenge of giving a new life to the club of the northeast, currently third ranked in the First League, at three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division at the time.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got an internationalization B," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"I grew to see Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if it succeeds in managing clubs."
Ross' predecessors as a Sunderland coach include Dick Advocacy, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel afraid to succeed in such consecrated names in such a large club, after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, for the moment, success is summed up the "can I take the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I reached that goal."
Ross' career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and took St. Mirren from the threat of defamation to the title of champion at the next time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
Taking note of the Alloa "was a real crusade," he recalls.
"I've always seen more of myself in the role of coach than in the role of player.
It seems strange because it went well, I made a living as a player, and I had a few high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and load pressures, but I feel very good as a coach.
I always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I ever felt during my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
The restoration groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but the occupation of the restaurants decreased 4.8%, showing the statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultant who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of England's good time and career at the World Football Championship, longer than expected, made the June standard, in which the pubs recorded a growth of 2.8% in sales, if repeated in July, but the restaurants knew a retreat.
The drop of 1.8% recorded in the sales of the restaurant in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the beverage-based business had by far the best performance, with a homologous growth that more than compensated for the drop in restaurants.
Pubs with the business based on meals have also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the catering operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks increased 6.6% over the month, with the meals receding 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst on leisure and restaurant RSM, said: "These results prolong the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors that influence out-of-home food market sales.
It is no surprise that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is especially harmful when added to the prolongation of cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators with the business based on meals. Only time will tell if the mildest temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desirable relief."
The growth of the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing of the launch of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, being recognized as the benchmark of the sector.
One in five children hides secret accounts from parents on social networks
One in five children - some with only 11 years of age - has secret accounts in the social networks that are hidden from parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of the "false" pages on Instagram
News aggravates fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "principal" account to show parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - creates accounts on the social networks that hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of "false" accounts on the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents, while simultaneously holding private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found out that teenagers were urging others to "violate her."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC's director Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected Non-Executive Director of the Scottish Athletic Council at the annual General Assembly of the regulator.
President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have a lot to win with their presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be able to act like the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to help guide sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-metre test at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, has stopped being able to walk after a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I stopped being able to walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell you that it would be able to recover and to what extent.
It has been a painful job but it has achieved a total recovery, I have learned to walk and even do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Announcement of milk extraction pump compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk extraction pump company divided opinions online with an announcement that compares mothers who breastfeed cows in the Order.
To mark the launch of that one that is described as the "first portable silent pump milk extraction", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom conferred by the new pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled vacation to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm ordering myself, but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The refractory goes on: "Bomby, pumpy, feeding babies, pumping, pumping, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the announcement published on the company’s Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, with many saying that it relieves the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Three decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen a few days after they were born," wrote a viewer.
The Elvie extraction pump is a discreet fit within a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone also said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the announcement, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious."
"I think the idea is great.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it makes all the sense.
This product is great," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It is a fun announcement directed to mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like "vaces".
It's not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, has no threads or tubes and is quietly fit within a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom to move around, catch their babies and even leave home while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother," commented: "Elvie's bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while we presented in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was a blanket.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded at the walkway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly moved to a camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children arrested reached a peak, although the monthly crossings of the border had remained relatively unchanged, partly because the rhetoric and severe policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult for children to be given care.
Traditionally, most of the "patterns" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by offering themselves to support a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adults who integrate their family aggregates would have to record their fingerprints, the data being shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified to the Congress that the service held dozens of people who applied to support unaccompanied minors.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
" Nearly 80% of their parents or members of their family members are illegal in the country, many of whom are foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, in accordance with the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconferencing, not in person, to defend your application for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid shall be promptly deported.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to access to violence or escape attempts, according to the officials of the reception centres and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as those of Tornillo, where the large size contributes to children's disruption signs being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma with which many are already debating themselves.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of American, French and Turkish occupation forces
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country to meet in his eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
"We must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions still displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all and any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for his return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led the refugees to remain abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone on the last great rebel bastion of Idlib created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement established "clear steps" and expressed hope that military action will target the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of government and opposition to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the challenge and scandals end their presidency in advance.
For those who would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of an ever-present presidency"!
At the moment, there are no signs of the viewer's tiredness.
Since 2014, the high-time audiences more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in noble time, a rise to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million spectators on great news nights.
"This is a strong call to people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC program "Designed Survival", about a head of office who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedy veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Remember once you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him I was going to vote Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos have entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories from Washington can determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family meetings of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can give.
However, it is more than being an informed citizen when we are watching at the sixth hour a debate by experts on the use by Bob Woodward of sources "with deep knowledge" in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich leather blouse ("a piece of clothing full of insolence", as mentioned by Washington Post) and the implications of the scalable descriptions of Stormy Daniels from... um... anatomy of President Trump.
For my part, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he's done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's dynamic cast and the daily revolts of the plot (attach with NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episodes or stay behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week was 26th on the North Coast of Kaaui, but he was closed at home, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He did not degrade television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify to the Senate's Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people said: this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all."

Significant external financing in the interim elections for the House of Representatives
It is no wonder that the 17th circle of Pennsylvania knows a flow of funding, thanks to a realignment of the electoral circles that left two holders in the race at the same place.
The recent readjustment of the suburban circles of Pittsburg put in the race the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb candidates against another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old circles favored Republicans unconstitutionally.
The race through the 17th circle sparked a hard fight for the financing of the campaign between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangent victory in the extremely contested extraordinary March elections for the 18th electoral circle of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the circle for 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to Democrats.
USA thought to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, then going back
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump Organization from the management.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of the US diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the State Department, in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million of US aid in 2017, including for the control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalised this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With the continuation of internal meetings, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to follow forward, putting aside all and any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now marked in mid-October, in a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The spokesperson of the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal deliberations covered by the anonymity.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be dropped may be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be allegedly guiding his investigation to see if Trump’s campaign has conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, while preparing to re-present himself to voters and perhaps to be judged by his peers.
It is a great deal of hypothesis and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the combat.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup d'état, since the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around inflection points like this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or blocked.
The Americans currently face several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating about his inability to perform the position.
Rosenstein says the news from The Times is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that is responsible for Mr Trump?
If we take these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we're not going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that in time occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the suastic.
With an inheritance of these, how could it not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Optimist Rangers before the game with the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tie in Spain with the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in the G Group of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented the middle Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time until the tie to two golos with the Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as trampolim for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We got the game with a positive mindset and we won a point.
Perhaps we could have gained near the end, but overall, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure that we will give our best to achieve a positive result.
Last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the trainings run well.
I hope we can give our best, forget the past time and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep with fear of this account saving-reform
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey have a clear idea of the kind of care they intend to take, few people have spoken to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
"People want a family member to look after you, but they're not having that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's how to get started.
Speak to your spouse and to your children: You cannot prepare your family to care for them if you do not give them their wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial consultant: Your consultant may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Their choices to finance continuing care may include a long-term traditional insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary value to help cover such expenditure or funding using their own savings, provided that these values are available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care provider, choosing a person of their trust to supervise their health care and ensure that professionals respect their wishes if they are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the establishment of a prosecutor's office on his finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers from a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer the questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only financial issues are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What's the medication?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan."
Men shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure when he returned home after one night in the city.
The victim, at the age of forty, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a random act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
Wounds do not involve life risk and the police have asked for witnesses.
Seisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reported to the authorities, hoping that the number of dead could increase.
With the interrupted communications, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Dogiana region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Domula, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dogliama is a region that extends over 300 km from the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status below one province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongula were hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring, being regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, originated a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong seisms reached the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, resulting in a tsunami that fell on the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 reached the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, depolating a tsunami with waves of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pdie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading the destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died underground under the debris of the buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes reached the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska governor and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, aged 29, resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested by suspects of domestic violence, interference in an investigation on domestic violence and detention resistance, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is pre-trially detained at Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre, subject to a $500 bail, KTU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously, innocent," he reported the station.
Palin is facing charges for three Class A offences, which means that he can be sentenced to a sentence of up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B offence, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to denounce the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
Your girlfriend accused him of slapping her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans' associations after associating the violent behavior of the child with post-traumatic stress resulting from her service in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died following an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 originated a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks have been cut, waiting for the number of dead to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the Sulawesi Central region, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jacarta.
They circulate videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutor's Office calls for rare capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The New York Public Ministry calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state by a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is accused of having used a truck rented by the Home Depot to execute an attack in October, on a cycle in West Side Highway, in the Manhattan Bay, attacking pawns and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and inflicted "intendedly" serious injuries, according to the notification calling for the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight accusations of murder at the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Prosecutor's Office in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack demanded a "considerable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov executed it as "atroz, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," he said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade, the South Zone of New York did not ask for the death penalty for an accusation.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug traffickers, but the penalty was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg was executed after being convicted by conspiracy to commit spying acts in favor of the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documentation, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators to feel good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the accusation.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, referred to the police.
He declared himself innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the accusers not to apply for the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should "feel the pressure" of Euroceptics, while one of Theresa May's Members suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Mr Peter Bone, second-hand conservative, said in Birmingham's protest that the United Kingdom "had already left" if Farage were Brexit's Minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile his deeply divided fellow believers was stressed by conservatives who defend permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The first administration has been debated to maintain its commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit partisans, permanence defenders and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Euroceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at Leave Means Leave in Solihull's concert that he intended "to end the Plan."
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd have left," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: "I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan."
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone denied the allegations that public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intends to remain is totally uncapped."
The conservative defender of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, saying to the journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we must vote.
Let the Checkers Plan fall and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: "Only the prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they were to prepare to betray the ruling out of the 2016 referendum.
"This became a question of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they won't get away with it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want them to pressure our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud, self-government United Kingdom."
However, the defenders of the stay marched to Birmingham before organizing a two-hour concert in the city center.
A crowd of activists posted tracks with the message "Conservators against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application in the opening of the congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'Canada more', for the frontier without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren plans to " seriously" the candidacy of the President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously "put the nomination to the President" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a usual critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for re-election in November against Republican deputy Geoff Diehl, co-mandate of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is speculated that Trump will be able to face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the format of debate since Trump took possession.
One of the participants asked whether he planned to apply for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix our government's problems and that includes a woman at the top."
Detention in the context of the murder of Wayde Sims, of the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the murder of the LSU Tigers basketball player, Wayde Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11:00 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Yes, 20-year-old, he was shot near Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims took a shot at his head, following which he ended up dying," the chief of police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde was defending a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to his presence on the scene, laying a weapon, recognizing that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-metre junior created in Baton Rouge, competed 32 games and was held for 10 times last time, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders in Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position on the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxing and made Hamilton have to face the end-of-the-ball traffic, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxings a little later and went after Vettel, but Hamilton passed it after a scrambled scramble, after which Ferrari's pilot reluctantly left the internal part of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double correction of trajectory to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, exchanging tires too late, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to overcome Kimi Raikkonen to end up in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the boxers on the 44th round but failed to improve his pace on the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to end up in the bedroom.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all over the weekend and he was a real gentleman, letting me out of it.
The team did exceptional work, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a concert on Saturday due to her insistence that she had not revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a church in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Justice Commission, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more, malicious and false".
"See the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate in the past few days, see the anger, see how people are ugly, malicious and false," Trump said.
"When we see the leaks and the communiqués and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Did Dianne Feinstein escape from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't leave me.'
Well, wait there.
The escape left us... no, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during the Saturday night's concert: "You know that more, that was the worst body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the appointment of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
"They are determined to resume power by resorting to all means.
We see wickedness, wickedness, it doesn't matter who they can achieve, who they have to step to take over power and control," the President said.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat by Belfast Giants for 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed from defeat on Friday in the First Division against the Belfast Giants game, winning the second hand for 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants had an initial advantage of two goals with endings by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the house team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
François Bouchard tied to Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald guarantee the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a revolution on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee for 2-1.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, having the Giants won the three previous games.
Dwyer's first goal emerged at the fourth minute (3:35) following assistance from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the advantage four minutes later.
In a first frenetic period, Sullivan put the house team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the tie to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants to arrive at the first break in leadership, marking their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The team of the house reorganized and Bouchard rematched with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen take Dundee to leadership for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, guaranteeing victory by marking the fifth goal of the team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape from the earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people died and many were still missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, resulting in a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to melt the region, leaving many residents buried in the debris in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grand, refused to leave his post while the control tower ravaged violence at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained focused to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower in front of the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Air Navigation Agency, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian television channel ABC News.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We were devastated by this news," he added.
However, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach the thousands, referring to the country's disaster management agency that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, since there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet been able to rescue," said the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military planes are transporting help and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute there are ambulances with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The minimarkets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, in charge of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday.
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations.
At the beginning of this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that took the lives of over 550 people.
Flying in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that there's a man missing after the plane's fall in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the aircraft that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after reporting that all 47 passengers and the crew had been rescued safely from the plane sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that, from Saturday afternoon, he could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The area company claimed to be collaborating with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further disclosure of the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The official authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline advanced that six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet known what the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the track and loved the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off the track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming too low.
"It was the best thing that happened," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other people had managed to crawl with the water through the waist and reach the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He reported that the ship attendants had panicked and started shouting, and that they had suffered a little head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working in a nearby spring improvement also helped in the rescue by travelling to an insufflable boat to transport people to land before the plane sinks to 30 metres (100 feet) of depth.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents with PNG registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its claims on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in the Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his phone records to reconstitute the movements of 20-year-old archduke Quintom Tellis, and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained localization data from several mobile phones confirming that Telllis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that your phone was with Chambers at the time you claimed to have been with your friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When the charge asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville."
Another incongruence in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only met one week ago.
Rowlett stated that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted SMS messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"You paid her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence should begin to present its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to begin to be examined by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling your music with positive messages.
Bristol's High Breed group claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return popularity to the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the United Kingdom thanks to the intervention of other interpreters, such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
Lover of New York processes couple by dismissal through a "racist" SMS message
A New York nurse is prosecuting a couple for discriminatory dismissal after having received a mother's text message by mistake complaining that "it was another black one".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed some fear when she discovered that the new mistress Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself for her first day of work in 2016.
"Don't believe... but a black one," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when he noticed his gaffe, a "taunted" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the poor performance of the Afro-American woman who was waiting for a Filipino lover.
Giselle Maurice was paid for his only day of work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is processing the couple and applying for a redundancies of USD 350/day for the six-month period for which she had been selected without a contract.
"I want to show you that you can't stay unpunished," he said to the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, saying that dismissing Giselle was perfectly logical because they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her something that she didn't really mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to the Post.
"Would your children trust someone who had treated you badly, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
By calling the "extortion" process, Plasco said that his wife had been a mother for only two months and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to chase someone like this?
It's not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the legal process took place, the public opinion court was speeding up condemning the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that the Paddington publishers feared that readers might not identify themselves with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard for us to put on someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's really fun to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a small bear to play writing the children's book, would not have brought his breast if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication had a agricultural flavor given his death last year.
About Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family," said the father was very proud of the success achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to the gabarolist," he said.
"But as Paddington was as real to him, it was as having a successful son: we are proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think that's how I saw the success of Paddington.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye on my phone.
Soon after landing, the daughter had been taken from emergency to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad would often call to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of surviving," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that she had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medicines doctors had given him to keep his heart functioning were slowly giving up and leaving his system.
She had been dead for a while and all her organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or mourn because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold myself."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers outside the proof why she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I've always made a low head.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mouth women attach cards to bridge to avoid suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any fathers to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Sharon Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said the son was a head promising with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it would light the room."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had "merited in darkness."
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible repercussion."
Sharon Davis created the postcards "to know that there are people who are available to help and who can talk to, or be a friend.
Do not shut up in yourselves. You have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, long-standing friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his 15-year-old companion, very shortly after the mother-in-law's death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in your behavior.
When the kids opened the presents, they didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one stays indifferent.
But we must all continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the beginning of the FBI's investigation.
"I thought that in terms of what I had asked for - a research with defined time and scope - we could be more united," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, pointing out that the committee was afraid to "drink" in the face of an entrenched biased impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is merely a temporary issue.
The intermediate elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at that time.
What happens after the FBI introduces your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not true that Kavanaugh is able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the vote of disembarkation and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea decreased during the Kim regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea has declined since the rise to the power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
Quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2706 2011.
Park stated that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers of people are asking for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang didn't make any public statement.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korea deserters.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally passed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China believes that deserters are illegal and non-refugees, and it is often to repatriate them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are at an impasse.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the U.S.A., Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general lines, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Ministers Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the Chamber, said that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
So he made these comments in an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse links to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a loud and dissolute voice, talking about his family and the years of high school.
He also explicitly accused the Democrats of the commission, calling for the allegations made against him of "the murder of grotesque and conspiracy character" organized by angry liberals by Hillary Clinton to have lost the presidential elections in 2016.
So he said to believe that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he does not have the conditions to serve in the Supreme Court given his preconceived conduct against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would try to challenge the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you do not qualify to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. Circuit Relations Court.
He therefore added that, as a Democrat, he feared potential opinions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (most known by Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the fame of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh asked questions about the possibility of repealing certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time for electing someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and waiting for us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of fury to tranship, and it can't get rid of without crying.
"We'll call it a joke," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, don't you think?"
A woman with an executive position in a company helped me immensely. She told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she had created a technique. When she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Ms. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well that, in an old job in an office dominated by men in whom he cried with inexpressible rage, being caught by the neck by an older woman - a manager nothing friendly who frightened me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be satisfied that they've been able to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, the Democratic Congressman of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extra-conjugal relationship on board a boat called Monkey Business and gave up the candidacy, a Patricia Schroeder who was extremely frustrated did not see why she could not apply herself to the presidents.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who called the situation of "The Snow White and the Seven dwarfs."
Given its late entry, the fundraiser was below the desirable and he swore he would only enter the race if he could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found out that some of his supporters only gave him $250, although they had given him $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top - gratitude for the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that raised so many obstacles to fundraising and sent the message to the voters instead of the delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears arose.
"Even seemed depressed," recalled Patricia Schroeder, speaking of the media's reaction.
"I thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.

As the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first rescue of the trade war between the U.S. and China was surprising, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of the experts, the departure of the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S.A., fired the first warning at the beginning of the year at taxing important Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the stage of a significant worsening of the situation with the new rates affecting goods worth $200 billion ($150 billion), actually charging half of all goods sent by China to the US.
Beijing has always cut back on the same coin, rising the rates recently from 5 to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has undertaken to follow the steps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will vacillate in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean complying with the demands, but showing a public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the U.S. trade war can positively sustain China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In reality, the fact that an early political decision in Washington or Beijing can result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think-tank group.
Minister for Foreign Affairs states that Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in the reconstruction of a country devastated by over seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The selection of Europe beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National in the vicinity of Paris, France.
The U.S. now accumulates six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time they won Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is once again crowned victorious after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reaches the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during almost the entire tournament, threw the tea starting for the water in the 16th hole, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all its rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst ranked player in the European Selection, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best-class player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England in which it may have been his last participation in Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most award-winning European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I can't contain myself.
It was a tough year.
I can't help thank Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so glad we beat the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help," said an emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He passed the word to his fellow countryman Jon Rham who defeated the legend of the American Gulf, Tiger Woods, for 2&1 in singulars on Sunday.
"It is impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew to see him playing," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the biggest players of all time with 14 great winning titles and just hit by Jack Nicklaus.
Except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection were discussed for arriving at the fairway.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the disappointing performance of his team. "I take care of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear into Europe.
Let's fight.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players were excellent.
We're going to reorganize and I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to keep going.
I like many of these 12 players and I'm proud to be your captain.
I have to take the hat off to the other team.
They were better."
