While the Kabyle people fought French colonialism in the 1940s and 1950s, the Algerians said, "What is the problem of the Kabyles with France?" Then, after the independence of Algeria, the roles were reversed by the false Algerian media. The Kabyles became the "zouaves" and the Algerian Arabs of the heroes who freed Algeria.

I'm supposed to tell no one.
That's not what Tom said, though.
That's what we're counting on.
"Where were you?" "I was at the station to drop my friend."
Tom answered that he was sorry.
We still need to pack the toy.
You need to know when to drop.
