someone in the family has a heart problem, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
any other symptoms or problems you notice besides muscle pain?
Are there other sick people like you with the same symptoms in your home?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Do you have any lack of air?
still feels pain in the chest
because this is the flu season
but also should not be ignored because of chest pain of heart
but now a more important problem is this chest pain
But I have difficulty breathing
But I know a lot of people are coughing me up.
but we must always treat chest pain with maximum seriousness
But now you're breathing well, aren't you?
for this chest pain I completely forgot
Feels like somebody strung your chest
it still feels like lack of air

Accrued rapid increase in coronovirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronovirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although at different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with VOCID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causing agent was a new coronovirus now known as coronovirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronovirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COPID-19 have a mild disease, i.e., a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most people recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves towards a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union country or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on 24 January 2020 in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that inclusive date 39,768 cases and 1727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17,750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy only.
Acquisition of the accumulated amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), reports of cases of VOCID-19 reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the accumulated number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed upward trends in the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 similar (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the accumulated amount of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK countries, compared with Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It stresses that, by 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is moving at a similar pace in all countries.
This is despite the different stages in which countries are found, the variations in national public health responses and possibly the different definitions of case in countries and the different protocols to select patients who have to undergo the test to confirm COVID-19, including the delayed tests.
In early March 2020, physicians in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not shown).
However, systematic collection should be made to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out in 2010–11 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios in relation to the saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the U.S. of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk >90 % overrun of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid ECDC risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since so far conglomerates of cases have been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units normally attend a defined regional catch population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Statistical Territorial Unit Nomenclature 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with VOCID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in ECDC's rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a quick, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response in an agreed manner if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in the death of 3000 people and has infected more than 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bat and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicable and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and complete analysis of the research topic, which is rapidly developed.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still do not have answers, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unheard and unrelenting reminder for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronovirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and to almost 50 more countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients given high and more than 3000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "number one public enemy" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on VOCID-19 have been published, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The objective of this analysis is to summarize the progress in research on this new subject which is rapidly developing.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15 % of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have met twice with highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, i.e. SARS-COV and MERS-COV, which caused an outbreak originally in China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third by coronovirus of which is recorded in the history of humanity.
As shown in Figure 1,1, unknown pneumonia conglomerates were first reported to the National Health Commission of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus became known.
On 15 January 2020, the first deadly case was registered in Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that transmission among humans is possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was put in quarantine and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the source of the infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak of a global health emergency.
At the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 more countries around the world (fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50 years old, very few had less than 20 and only 14 infected people were under 10 years of age.
The SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 expanded in conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, 5 days (from 2 to 9) elapsed between the appearance and diagnosis of VOCID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the time of massive mobilization prior to the Spring Party in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronoviruses are a subfamily of large and wrapped viruses that contain a unique sense chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are the ones that infect humans.
Spiga glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors, angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converter enzyme and dipeptidel peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to the cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the nucleocapside glucoproteins and proteins, vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 % in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original outbreak site: the Huanan Huhan seafood market.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, particles of SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultra thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by the orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by the orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the electronic chromoscopic structure of the full-length human ACE2 in resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with the transporter amino acid B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic diana for the study of drugs in order to suppress the infection of SARS-CoV-2.
Origin and intermediate guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bat is considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in 96% to two coronaviruses similar to SARS of bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown what intermediate host helped the virus cross the barrier of species to infect humans, and the transmission route remains diluted.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the bat virus to humans, which involved the homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long hockey mammals that feed on ants and are usually used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate guest of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a pangoline-discovered coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % difference spread by the whole of two genomes remains a great difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected that provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physicalchemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days less than 20 °C with a moisture of 40-50 %.
The SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75 %, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective for disabling the virus.
All the human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronovirus.
So far, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only use previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectins receptors, Toll (TLR), NOD-type receptors (NLR) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophagic phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is added to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Co-operating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defence cells.
However, coronoviruses may inhibit T-cell functions by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, the isolated antibodies of a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organic failure and even death.
The infection of SARS-CoV-2, characterized by conglomerate appearance, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demography of 8866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adapt the effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period; this way, asymptomatic infected people will be expected to transmit the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine extend to 24 days?
The fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, dysnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dysnea or hypoxemia one week after the disease occurred.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for an early diagnosis.
A late December 2019 demographic study indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dysnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory care.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dysnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with VOCID-19 and in line with the most lethality of the MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99 %-100 %), dry cough (29 %-75 %), dysnea (40 %-42 %), diarrhoea (20 %-25 %) and throat pain (13 %-25 %) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory care was required in approximately 14 % to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2 % when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10 per cent in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 was high and rose to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV's R0 was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
Previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a larger propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
It is therefore much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle as a cruiser.
Patients usually have a travel or residence history in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to the occurrence.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients given discharge from the hospital may re-engage the virus, alarm signal that the time of quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of peripheral blood white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and high levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of the degradation of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the count of lymphocytes was progressively reduced.
Chest anomalies are detected in the chest X-rays of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or opacity in bilateral shingle glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of fluid and progressive fibrosis seriously affect the gas exchange.
Type I and type II neumocyte dysfunction decreases the surfactant level and increases the surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings in chest X-rays are usually in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the dislocation of pneumonia, the formation of a hyalin membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes into the intersticus, and multinucleated sincial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral infection and SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using a reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020 began to be used.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of a history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre sample) using a graded rod in less than one hour that does not require complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase the sensitivity and convenience of clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can generally provide support care to patients with VOCID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express the ACE2, such as those of the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory care is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (OCC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of potentially fatal heart or respiratory insufficiency.
In addition, maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The cytokine storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated reaction from the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals that are the main cause of the ADR and multi-organic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-receptor antibody of IL6, have been used to treat cytokines storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are modulation of the T-cell-led immune response; the blocking of IFN-, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a cytokine signaling pathway 4 suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and CVID-19.
On the other hand, they may cause serious side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, affecting the prognosis remarkably.
However, cautionary use of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the date of this analysis, the effectiveness of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in a U.S. patient with VOCID-19 has been verified.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other monocatenary RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of tests in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
Blood extraction from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to combat pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
His symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction of inflammation and viral loads and a better saturation of oxygen in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which may lead to fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects largely depend on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the TCM theories.
Most effective components remain unknown or imprecise, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China who used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hubei, who used TCM in only about 30% of its patients with VOCID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, since many other impact factors, such as the amount and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of western medicine (MO) only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only.
What is most surprising, the worsening rate of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM are still awaiting more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and determine the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are generally very afraid of the highly contagious and even mortal disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric disorders were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Contact tracking and mandatory quarantine, as part of public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty of the effects of infection, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be given to patients with VOVID-19, suspected persons and those in contact with them, as well as to the general public who needs it.
Psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact among people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission chain of infected animals and humans to susceptible guests, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate potent and long-term neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live viruses attenuated in animal models for SARS have been evaluated.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these vaccines in older people and lethal stimulation models and their protection against infection by zoonotic viruses should still be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS went out 17 years ago and no new cases have been registered since then.
On the other hand, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadicly in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immuns is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) required for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronaviruses.
As is a new disease, the COVID-19 has recently begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a model of prediction for the disease is essential so that health agencies can prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies that have been reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with VOCID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS forecast, which was also successful for COVID-19.
VOCID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care most likely had underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably greater than those who did not require them (on average 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognosis factor in the evolution of patients with VOCID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 compared to 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with CVID-19 who require intensive care most likely suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also join positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of reactive C protein (CPR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, a high level of dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict patient evolution.
These enzymes are expressed intensely in several organs, especially the heart and the liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with the other symptoms for predicting clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were extended in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period in patients with VOCID-19.
Mental stress: as previously described, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have experienced extraordinary stress, since in general they endured long periods in quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and they witnessed the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide long-term psychotherapy and support for these patients to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or does not cause symptoms in the early phase of the infection, as is the case with other coronoviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients at an early stage or incubation period can produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, whereas transmission was not more likely to occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuing quarantine of almost all the population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended by March and the descending phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., considered that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and had left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode similar to the influenza.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been managed to control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is weakened in terms of infectiousness and eventually is extinct or converted into a less pathogenic virus that coexistes with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted through cough or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also detected in the stools, which raises a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41 per cent of cases were possibly caused by nosocomous infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even transmissors in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and respirator masks N95 (Series Number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
The surgical masks prevent fluid droplets of a potentially infected person from being transmitted by the air or clinging to the surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 masks (Series 1860 number) can protect against inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the ions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks stacked, the medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use the masks N95 (series number 1860) and not the surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, health care providers must use insulating bricks to measure in order to further reduce the contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite having used a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also use protective scars or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more frequently followed by usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered to be a suitable distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused great warning in China for its experience with SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and controlling the disease.
This message significantly relaxed the alarm of the public, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Party, and the critical time to contain the disease on a minimum scale in Wuhan was up to now.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and take decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, since each word matters to citizens and may change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for the formal reports of doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at an early stage, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective mock-ups to raise public awareness about epidemic diseases and to test and improve society's response system on a regular basis.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and some 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the sensation of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
VOCID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also greater in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91 % compared to 1.44%).
Patients with VOVID-19 transmit the virus even if they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are severely ill, resulting in a much greater difficulty in controlling the spread of VOVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can give positive results in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given such rapid progress in the investigation of COVID-19, several important issues remain to be resolved, such as the following:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronoviruses similar to SARS, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What was the intermediate species that transmitted the original host virus, let's say, bats, humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to slow the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can resurgence at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins the ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and causes subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also join the cells that express the ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically as it is transmitted among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, extinguish itself like SARS or resurgence periodically like flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to find answers to these questions and many others.
However, no matter what it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic Origins of Human Coronary Viruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven co-evolution of co-ronoviruses and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronoviruses were known to cause mild diseases, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have invested the coin in revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronovirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put the coronoviruses in the center of attention again and surprised us with high communicableity and reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronovirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human coronoviruses.
Most human coronoviruses have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
It is also known as the intermediate reserve guests of some human coronaviruses.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Researching the interactions between coronovirus and animal guests could also provide important information on the pathogen of coronoviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven coronoviruses of humans, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zoonotic origins and in the transmission between species.
Significantly, we compare and contrast the different coronoviruses of humans from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current coronovirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is analysed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are highlighted.
The coronovirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive monocatenary RNA viruses with wrap.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, by the form of crown that they have under an electronic microscope.
As for its structure, coronoviruses have non-separated genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the replicated polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spiga (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of accessory proteins specific to each line are also codified by different coronovirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alcoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus of betacoronavirus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes of most alcoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronoviruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronerviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronvirus.
The other five beta-coronavirus are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhoea.
However, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause autolimited symptoms.
In fact, up to the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronovirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history and has infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coroner virus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later called SARS-CoV-2, is the causing agent of the ongoing disease epidemic by coroner 2019 (COVID-19), which has taken over 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as at 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must be prepared for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven coronaviruses of humans have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronoviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but have great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of the coronoviruses of humans provides a framework to understand the natural history, the driving force and the factors of restriction of jumping between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the intermediate stock and animal guest and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for preventing future spread.
In this analysis, we present a general description of zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogen of human coronary viruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parent viruses of human coronaviruses are not usually pathogens in their natural reservoir guests, but become pathogens after transmission among species to a new host.
We also examine the evolution trend of human coronoviruses, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to a decrease in pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
It has been known about the coronoviruses of animals since the end of the 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
Seven coronoviruses of humans have been identified in recent decades.
A brief summary of the history of the findings of human coronary viruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory pathways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow on cell lines WI-38 of the lung.
Patients with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultivation and the subsequent serial step in brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections from other respiratory pathway pathogens, such as influenza A and rhinovirus viruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to be broadcast predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a serious infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronovirus in the history of humanity, and the etiological agent is the SARS-CoV, the third human coronovirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 cases reported with 774 deaths and spread to many countries and continents.
Apart from the superowners, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4-7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general malaise and chills, followed by dysnea, cough and difficulty in breathing as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, altered liver function and high creatine kinase are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory care.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, the liver and the kidney, can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a family member of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate the human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of choriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7 % of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronoviruses acquired in the community have been well adapted to humans and, in general, are less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although there have been accidents due to unknown causes, as in the rarest case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to have caused serious infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory are originating in the Middle East, cases imported occasionally to close contacts in several European and Tunisian countries have been recorded.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of the MRS are similar to those of the SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MRS among diseases caused by human coronoviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases were confirmed in the laboratory, with a high lethality of 34.4%, which turns MERS-CoV into one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to be known.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates were detected from patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, who retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 an emergency of public health of international importance and also referred to the disease COVID-19.
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude mortality of 3,4%.
Significantly, lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2 %, while outside it is 1.2 %.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dysnea.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82 %, they are classified into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six coronerviruses of humans, there are similarities and differences of great interest.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of the human coronovirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronoviruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four human coronoviruses acquired in the community (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most frequently observed in coronovirus infections of human acquired in the community, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of VOCID-19 is also observed as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is somewhat smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both the acquired human coronoviruses in the community and the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the acquired human coronaviruses in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has an important function, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it still needs to be diluted in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including their transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human passes, will have an impact on the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four human coronoviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four coronoviruses of humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronovirus pandemics.
Human coronoviruses that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that develop severe diseases by human coronoviruses have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronoviruses must be replicated in humans to an extent sufficient to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counter the factors of restriction of the host.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people are infected, the more likely it will be to fully adapt to humans.
If well adapted, human transmission would be difficult to stop through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronoviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission among humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to propagate to potential human objectives, possibly through one or more intermediate guests and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics both to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as to the four human coronovirus acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as the human coronary virus acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenous than the human coronavirus acquired in the community and less pathogen than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and circulate among humans without an animal storage or intermediate guest.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronoviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifiers of human coronoviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogen in this guest.
Similarly, a reserve guest houses a human coronavirus in a continuous and long-term manner.
In both cases, the guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of the human coronavirus or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronovirus was introduced into the intermediate guest just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and it is usually pathogen.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of human infection and fulfill the role of host amplifier by allowing the virus to be replicated transiently and then transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
A human coronovirus may cause a terminal host infection if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronoviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
Epidemiological data showed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had contact with hunting animals.
Further investigations into seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
A masked palm civets (Paguma Larvata) and a dog mapche in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that onions of wild masked palms or farms without exposure to the markets of live animals were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the onions of masked palms would only act as intermediate amplifier guest, but not as natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80 % of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities of several species of small mammals can not be ruled out as an amplifier intermediate guest of SARS-CoV can also be found.
They all seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Further searches of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat virus, known as the Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese herrature bats.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat coronoviruses share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92 % with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the basis for the new concept that bats house emerging pathogens in humans.
Several coronaviruses similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as live virus.
Human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
It was shown that WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of bats uses ACE2 of bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter the cells.
Amazingly, the serums of patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize the WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, in general, it is believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parenting virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reserve guest of SARS-CoV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as the bat CoV-HKU4 and the bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same receptor as the host, dipeptidel peptidasa 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
The sequences of polymerase RNA dependent on MERS-CoV phylogeneticly are closer to its counterparts of beta-coronaviruses of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, you can't find a MERS-CoV live in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87 %.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate storage guest of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in MRS-CoV neutralizer antibodies specifically, as well as camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudation of dromedaries, which supports even more than camels act as guests of Bona fide reservorium of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that mild symptoms were generally observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for research with MERS-CoV.
Significantly, infected camels spread viruses not only via respiratory, but also via fecal-oral, which is also the main way of spreading viruses from bats.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MRS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species hosting the MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 shares a nucleotide homology of 96.2% with a bat crownvirus, RaTG13, isolated from rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the immediate reserve guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future near identical bats coroner virus.
Presumably, the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the wholesale seafood market of Huanan, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent metagenomic sequencing-based studies have suggested that a group of small mammals at risk, known as pangolines (Javanica Manis), could also house ancestral beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangoline coronovirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 85-92 % with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two virus sub-links similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-connection domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97,4 %.
In marked contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick pangoline also reported the detection of viral counts in lung samples, which appear to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that it supports a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the difference in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-corronaviruses of pangoline related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even lower than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronavirus of pangoline related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals should still be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the BDRs of beta-coronavirus-related pangolines SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-proposal defends a recombination between pangoline beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is extended among beta-coronaviruses.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronoviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both the HCoV-NL63 and the HCoV-229E could have originated from bat virus coronovirus, while the parent viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and the HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A bat coronovirus called ARCoV.2 (coronavirus of the Apalaches Mountains) detected in a North American tricolor batovirus was closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat virus, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although it has also been suspected of camelids as intermediate guests.
For the sake of clarity, the knowledge that has so far been the animal origins of known human coronoviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human coronovirus transmission events among species in history.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed between species until it infected humans from livestock in 1890, there was a respiratory infection pandemic.
The history of transmission between HCoV-229E species is not known with such precision.
Alcoronaviruses of bats have been found closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpacas alfacoronvirus.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of bats virus directly to humans.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the alpacas.
Secondly, bat-coronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and not pathogens in bat-coronaviruses, while alpaca alfa-coronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpac alfacoronvirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the alpacas acquire the alpacas related to human HCoV-229E.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogen viruses in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while bat alcoronaviruses act as a genetic collection of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate guests who transmit viruses to humans, particularly in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of inter-species transmission, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with a profuse collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and great flying capacity are all favourable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate guest, to being a stable and natural reserve guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans continue to be a terminal guest of MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangoline betachoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in the pangoline.
They may be a terminal guest of beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, such as the civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of transmission between species of SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reserve host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through the slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, the pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifier guests in whom a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody study is required in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with bats and pangolines.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronovirus crossing the barriers of species.
First, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary RNA viruses, estimated coronovirus mutation rates could be considered "moderated" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per year, per site 2, according to the phase of adaptation of the coronovirus to new guests.
The coronoviruses have an exorribonuclease of reading check, whose elimination results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inaccessibility.
Curiously, it is known that the nucleotide analogue replication of coronovirus is suppressed by inhibition of this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, coronovirus mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually high when coronoviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared with SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be expected that he has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the RNA genome along the coronovirus exercises additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the probability of co-evolution between species, which enables the emergence of new coronovirus when the appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the copious single open reading frameworks and the functions of the encoded proteins towards the 3' genome direction.
Thirdly, coronovirus changes randomly and frequently from templates during RNA replication using a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a guest who acts as a mixing vehicle, the chain change occurs frequently during the transcription of coronovirus RNA.
Full-length RNA and highly homologous subgenomics could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found in the HCoV-HKU1 and the HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronoviruses, such as batsellague SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Huesped virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences the transmission between species.
In the present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in inter-species transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated SARS-CoV strains of humans and animals, SARS-CoV is believed to experience rapid adaptation in different guests, particularly with S protein RBD mutations.
In general, the S protein RBD of a coronovirus interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the response of host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1, fragment that joins the human ACE2 and its receptacles for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including bat, civet, mouse and dog mapache, allowing transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human and animal viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the cause of binding to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The SIRS-CoV of civets has K479N and S487T mutations in their RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the spiga protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be crucial for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30 % difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit implies that S protein binding affinity with human ACE2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electronic chromoscopy study indicates the affinity 10 to 20 times greater than that of the human ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other receptacle might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, the HCoV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronovirus receptors, such as N aminopeptidas in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sial acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses to humans, after the transmission of species from their animal guests.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the transmission among human coronovirus species is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reserve guests of the human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to the transmission of species.
Human coronoviruses should take advantage of the factors of dependence of the host and subvert the factors of restriction of the host to make the transmission between species successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction virus-hoesped should still be identified and characterized.
A full genome objective investigation of the factors of dependence and restriction of the guest for SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial using advanced CRISPR technology.
New human coronovirus appearance: start from scratch
The diversity of bats’ coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bats coronovirus acts as the genetic collection of human coronoviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also promote the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes have the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered to be important in adapting to humans, since bat virus related to SARS-CoV has been isolated, but it has been determined that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A elimination of 29 nucleotide characteristics of SARS-CoV was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has possible history of recombination with alpha and gamma-coronavirus lines, which identified a large number of smaller recombinant regions in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombinations locations were also identified at nsp9, most of the nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the EMRS-Edemic CoV has undergone recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses are recombined with other coronaviruses of animals in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely results in the release of viruses from selection pressures exercised, for example by the host's immune system.
One example of these effects is the loss of a complete-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to a elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 could be observed in bats and camels related to HCoV-229E, the alpacal alfacoronavirus has a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a change of frame.
Finally, although no less important, the evolution of the new human coronaviruses is also driven by the selection pressure on its reserve guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats with coronovirus were infected, indicating mutual adaptation between coronovirus and bats.
The bats appear to be well adapted to the anatomic and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activation of the proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronoviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to positive regulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats may suppress the replication of coronavirus and affect the reading check of exorribonuclease, which provides selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
Coronovirus strains more pathogens could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for adaptation to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronoviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reserve guests, such as bats and camels.
They respond vigorously without causing a strong immune response from the guest.
This is based on the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same immune response delinking strategy could have a beneficial effect on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLP3 inflammation in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, the inhibition of inflammatory NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although there has been a bat betacoronavirus that shares a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been determined that the animals and the animals in the markets have viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate guest of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
There have been significant homologous betacoronviruses of pangolines to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that the betacoronviruses of pangolines could bring gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, whether deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have recovered protagonistism due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronoviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronoviruses in human transmission in humans.
Vasta evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates in contact between humans and animals in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, the pangolines should withdraw from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several closely related beta-coronvirus lines of pangoline saRS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals it remains to be diluted in future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed through the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in China with the markets of wild animals to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks may appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in a wild state.
In particular, bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great possibilities for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recombinate, which would give rise to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until the opportunity is presented to propagate.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with bats and other wild species can be minimized by educating the population to get away from them.
Continued surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze in what circumstances bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it must be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, experimental monitoring and infection must be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parents' viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continuous investigations in this area will illuminate the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for the "suspecting cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guidance guide for the diagnosis and treatment of infection for the new coronovirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and is a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspecting case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronovirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) triggered an outbreak, which is now officially known as coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was called coronovirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid advisory guideline published online at Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He's been paying a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our director received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple classification proposal based on his clinical experience.
His work added new evidence for our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference to this pandemic throughout the world.
We support his important work and express our gratitude.
However, your work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (Seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case, it is necessary to combine any point of epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations to do a thorough analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations must be performed if there are no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with evidence of positive nucleic acid); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed groups of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas such as house, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in COVID-19 infection images; (3) total white blood cell counts showing a normal lymphocyte count, decreased or reduced at the early start stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case must be based on a suspicious case with some characteristic of pathogen or serological evidence as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of complete viral genome showing high homogeneity to recognized new coronoviruses; (3) positive result for specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or increased title ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the actual-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory pathways was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then, the serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us that we should be careful with asymptomatic and symptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated, since they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we hope that there will be more direct evidence and we will ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we recommend seeking and meeting the latest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest in one day
Bangladesh yesterday confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, the director of FDICR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two between 51 and 60 and one between 41 and 50.
He also said that two of the victims were from Daca.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic COVID-19.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was attending the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Transport by Road and Bridges, Obadul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned until this next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had started on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
Transport of essential products such as medical supplies, fuel and food was still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, were two men who returned from Italy and one of them as well.
As of March 19, these three had already recovered.
More than one million infections by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronovirus infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronovirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronovirus infections and Zambia had its first death related to the coronovirus.
North Korea stated, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without coronovirus infections.
Last day, the World Health Organization reported 1,051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the previous twenty-four hours at 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronovirus infections.
Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1st.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians would continue to earn their wages without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency state 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfews in the holy cities La Mecca and Medina throughout the day; before, the curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay at home until May 1st.
Supermarkets in Australia are lowering the bounds of toilet paper by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian Woolworths and Coles supermarket chains lowered their toilet paper purchase limits to two and a transaction package in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
It was reported that consumers were supplying for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-indulge.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to a package on request.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release on 8 March, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within one hour of delivery," and said that the demand "was unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
Sales went up with a "strong increase" last week, according to a spokesperson from Woolworths.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To alleviate the shortage further, Coles requested larger packages to suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made available stocks for a special offer of Wednesday planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local city council restrictions on delivery times by truck make it difficult for them to do so.
It foresees an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer of Wednesday.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail sales expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He stressed that the toilet paper is a bulky article, which causes a low amount of stocks in numbers, and, when exhausted, leaves a wide empty space in the shelves, thereby intensifying the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there were an abundant amount of the article in the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy] and there were large quantities, it would probably be minimized the panic, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday that the stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent, noted that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the report in News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first auctioner in Melbourne, when less auctions were made because buyers had free time on the long weekend of Workday.
The NT News Thursday edition, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page poster designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets at the beginning were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia of 3 March, in which they said that they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including mascarillas, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online Ocado supermarket limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares pandemic COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO highlighted the need to encourage governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO general director.
We are very concerned, both at alarming levels of propagation and gravity, and at alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic "has no precedents".
In statements published by CNN in February, he said, "In addition to the influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the emergence to the continued worldwide spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic status arises following the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak an emergency of public health of international importance.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it's going to get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126 000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The pandemic of the coronovirus 2019–20 is an ongoing disease pandemic by coronovirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronovirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as an international emergency of public health on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97 000 deaths as a result.
About 364 000 people recovered.
The case mortality rate was estimated at 4 per cent in China, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms, usually, is about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include handwashing, coughing mouth covering, keeping away from other people and the control and self-insulation of people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, hazardous controls at the workplace and closures of facilities.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic change, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-motivated purchases.
Schools and universities closed at the national or local level in 193 countries, which affected approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation was disseminated on the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas with significant cases of viruses.
Due to reduced travel and heavy-duty closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an unknown group of cases of pneumonia, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases, mostly, were related to Huananan's wholesale seafood market, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the coronoviruses of bats, the pangoline coronoviruses and the SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who was known to have symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last group of the wet market.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two-thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province, might have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to the reports, they declined in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of uninformed cases, especially among those with lighter symptoms.
As at 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, felt that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases relate to the number of persons who underwent COVID-19 testing, and who obtained a positive result confirmed in accordance with the official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had conducted evidence in more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had had official policies to refrain from testing in people who had only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, an estimated 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79 per cent of the cases recorded.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy were considerably higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97 000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80% of the deaths corresponded to people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to people who died positive in the COVID test, according to official protocols.
The number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who died without the test, for example, in their homes, in elderly households, etc.
Part data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official registration of COVID deaths in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesperson from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States admitted "We know that [the number of deaths declared] is an underestimation", a statement corroborated by the anecdotic reports of subcontamination in the United States. This underestimation is common in pandemics, such as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, out of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. In general, several indicators were used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global proportion of deaths in cases is 6.0% (9739/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the rate of lethality per case, reflecting the percentage of individuals diagnosed as a result of a disease, and the rate of lethality due to infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and not diagnosed) who died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific deadline and consider a specific population from the infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the rate of lethality for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the case lethality rate.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ according to location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, usually stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease remains without available guests.
But, at this moment, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast of when that will happen."
China's chief medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "it could end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow WHO's recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, expressed that the SARS-CoV-2 "will remain circulating, possibly for one or two years".
According to the study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt expressed, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is transmitted so easily, disappears completely" and "may become a seasonal disease, which reappears every year."
The virulence of the reappearance would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected persons may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, spout production in the respiratory tract (flam), loss of the sense of smell, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, pressure or persistent pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in awakening and blue color on the face or lips; in the face of manifestations of these symptoms, immediate medical care is recommended. The greater progress of the disease may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not present clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, researchers therefore advised to closely control and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected persons in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic proportion range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; most often it is from 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to studies, when coughing without covering the mouth droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when speaking. Respiratory drops can also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although, generally, the virus is not transmitted through the air.
The droplets can enter the mouth or nose of the people near or possibly inhale to the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and thus air spread.
It can also be propagated when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through stools, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although propagation may be possible before symptoms are manifested and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People obtained positive results in the disease tests up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only some reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by laboratory, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, although the ease with which the disease is spread is not fully clear, a person generally infects two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, a day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in tests of COVID-19 performed to pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other areas that might have touched infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronoviruses related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when contacting soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus beta-coronavirus, its subgener sarbecovirus (line B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the level of the complete genome, it is 96 % identical to other samples of coronovirus bat (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangoline viruses and humans.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the pangoline coronovirus and SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92 % of the genetic material, which is not enough to demonstrate that the pangoline is the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although, ultimately, it is confirmed by the inverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) chain reaction of infected secretions or computed tomography images.
According to a study in Wuhan comparing the polymerase chain reaction with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using computed tomography as a detection method nor as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first one published on January 17.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with inverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in blood or respiratory samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
Usually, this test is performed with a nasopharyngeal hip, although you can also use a hip for the throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be sufficiently accurate to approve its widespread use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic features in the images of radiographs and computed tomography (TC) of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral glass opacity and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international online database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlapping with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis of unconfirmed images by chain reaction of polymerase has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study carried out in China compared the results of computed chest tomography with those of polymerase chain reaction and showed that although imaging is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with X-rays and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general hygiene, handwashing, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without having washed your hands before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing your handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential journeys from and to countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that healthcare providers who care for someone who might be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. The tracking of contacts is an important method for the health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent greater transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments for this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement requiring limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive in the COVID-19 test. Wrong ideas about how to prevent infection are circulating; for example, nasal lavage and mouthwashing gangs are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when they have their hands visibly dirty; before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when coming into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with at least 60 % of alcohol in volume when water and soap are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without having washed them before.
Surfaces may be decontaminated with several solutions ( within one minute after disinfectant exposure to a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 % and iodate at 0.2–7.5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs, be disinfected if a case of VOCID is suspected or confirmed in an installation.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with flexed elbow or a disposable handkerchief for coughing or sneezing, and that they immediately wish the handkerchief.
It is recommended that those who might be infected use surgical masks, as the use of a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by the air droplets that are dispersed by talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without a proper hand hygiene." It has also been recommended to use masks in people who care for someone who might have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they run a high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends using non-medical masks made with fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 foot) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand recommend that people manufacture cloth masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited leaving public spaces without using a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask while in public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million mascarillas a day since mid-March, demanded the use of mascarillas by passengers on trains and interurban buses on 1 April.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while it also recommends the manufacture of masks made at home to those who cannot buy them.
The masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distances (also known as physical distances) include measures for the control of infection designed to stop the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, places of work, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can implement social distance methods by staying in their homes, limiting trips, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact and physically distance themselves from other people.
Many Governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by government agencies and health organizations in the United States was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and thereafter to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at increased risk of suffering from serious diseases and complications, and CDCs recommend that they stay in their homes as much as possible in areas of the community affected by outbreak. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies have begun to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, whether virtually or away.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt full social isolation, rather than encourage them to keep in contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have published sexual health guidelines to use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations that only have sexual relations with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-insulation was recommended at home for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of having been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on adequate self-inclusion, and many Governments have demanded or recommended the self-quarantine of entire populations in the affected areas.
The stricter self-quarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to take self-care for 14 days from the moment of the last possible exposure.
Strategies to control an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be adopted at the same time.
Removal requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to decrease the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This decreases the risk of collapsing health services and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, mascarella and autoquarantine use; community measures aimed at physical distancement, such as closure of schools and cancellation of events of mass competition; Community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures and cleaning of surfaces. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its severity was evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in whole cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented localized mass detection assessments and quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to infected persons who decided to make quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of mascarillas and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care in two thirds and deaths in half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Removal may be preferred, but it should be maintained throughout the time that the virus circulates in the human population (or until there is a vaccine available, if that happens first), since otherwise the transmission is reactivated quickly when the measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic implies social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicinal products approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing medicines.
Taking free sales medicines for cooling, drinking liquids and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory care may be required.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of VOCID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure of response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for primary medical hospitals and services for resource redistribution at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on VOCID-19 tests, canceling optional procedures where possible, separating and insulating positive patients at VOCID-19 and increasing intensive care capacities by training staff and increasing the number of breathers and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case may have originated (the so-called patient zero).
The first case known to the new coronavirus can be dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over a month, the number of coronovirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the wholesale market of shellfish of Huanan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were observed that Dr. Zhang Jixian was in charge of the Hubei Provincial Hospital, which reported to the Jianchan CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
The police warned eight of these doctors, including Li Wenenliang, to spread false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reproved by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
In early January, sufficient cases of cause pneumonia had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan as to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven days and a half.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to migration through the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport center and an important railway crossing.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Following official data show that, as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. On 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the most confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364 000 have been recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as orders to stay at home, shelter orders at the site or confinement) and curfews. On 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are in some form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million are in South Africa and 13 billion are in India.
As of 26 March, 17 billion people worldwide had some kind of confinement, which increased to 26 billion people two days later, about the third of the world ' s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates from 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown group of cases of pneumonia, and her hospital informed the Jianphan CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned the doctors in Wuhan to "disseminate rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially stated that there were no "clear evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of mankind", on 23 January a health cord was announced which prohibited travel within and outside Wuhan, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
Celebrations of the Chinese New Year (25 January) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, the Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented further measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, which included the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of the holiday of the Spring Festival.
Universities and schools were also closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented within and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor exits. After the start of the world stage of the outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, only one case had been transmitted to mainland China at the national level in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted at the national level was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, were simplified two months after the confinement was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details of when this policy would be completed.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China urged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for signatures. The Council declared a day of mourning that will begin with a three-minute national silence on 4 April at 10:00, coincidenting with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to submit their respect online to meet the physical distance in order to avoid the rebounding of the COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 was spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.
On 22 February, of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or approximately 13% reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the maximum alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered to be the largest and best organized program in the world to test the virus in the population and isolate infected people, in addition to identifying and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new arrivals from other countries through a mobile application, drive-through centers to perform virus detection tests with results available the next day and the increased diagnostic capacity to be able to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's programme is seen as a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in whole cities. At first, South Korea's society was polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand that Moon be dismissed for what they considered a mismanagement of the outbreak on the part of the Government, or to praise their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases in a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, from 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad should remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance in the testing of the virus from 121 different countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, institutions of higher education and schools.
Iran has destined five billion rials to combat the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to put into quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic among cities as a result of New Persian Nowruz year continued.
Chia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a post-China virus propagation center.
In the midst of statements of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March 23 of its 290 members reported that they had positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissidentity, and also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is a greater risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, that they also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest number recorded in the country since the outbreak.
As at 17 March, at least 12 Iranian expolitics or politicians had died from the disease.
On March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to one WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than are reported.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran might be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for relief from economic sanctions for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak was confirmed in Italy, when two Chinese tourists gave positive in the testing of SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, which led the Italian Government to suspend all flights from and to China and to declare the state of emergency.
Subsequently, a non-related group of cases of COVID-19 was detected, which began with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree to contain the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "It will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of work and sporting events in these areas has already been ordered."On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country as Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Series A football matches, were to be held at closed doors until April, but, on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of practically all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on the selection protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy surpassed China as the country with the highest number of coronovirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3405 pandemic deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoverys in Italy, and most of these cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test all people with the virus to date could contribute to the high lethality rate.
The UK response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any kind of social or quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government was criticized for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in responding to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement that discouraged social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of workers' salaries up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distance measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two persons and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those deemed strictly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the police could demand compliance with these restrictions by imposing fines and dispersing meetings.
The closure of most companies was ordered, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, sawmills, gas stations and workshops.

Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in conducting tests, which hid the true magnitude of the outbreak at that time.
The testing was carried out by the defective test kits produced by the Federal Government in February, the lack of approval by the Federal Government of non-governmental test kits (of academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February and the restrictive criteria for individuals to qualify for a test until early March (after a medical order was required).
As at 27 February, Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.

On the other hand, China's assistance was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, when the Chinese secretism authorities were accused of preventing prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis, in which the Central Government "has provided regular updates to prevent panic at the New Moon Year holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea pointed out that, while "it was definitely not a recommendation that WHO has made", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the most concentrated place" and said that "it had no precedent in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of the transmission of human beings outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak an emergency of public health of international importance (ESPII), the sixth SPII since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine influenza pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that the ESPII was due "to the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without solid health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that needlessly interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO turned to the world community for a contribution of $675 million to fund strategic preparation in low-income countries, and cited the urgency to support those countries "who do not have systems to detect people who contracted the virus, if there are."
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future."On 11 February, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system in the response."
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which allowed the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on the health response while the other agencies can provide their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development implications of the outbreak."
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was activated to provide international experts and WHO on the ground in China to assist in national management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level and to visit the site to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including urban and rural environments."On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronary virus pandemic", and noted that, although it was still very early to call it a pandemic, countries should nevertheless be "in a stage of preparation".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent there a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February WHO officials said that the global assessment of the threat of coronovirus would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a verification of reality for all planet governments: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and we must be ready," insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also said that current data did not guarantee that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and said that this statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared pandemic the outbreak of coronavirus.
The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned, both by alarming levels of propagation and severity, and by alarming levels of inaction." WHO has received important criticism as to why the pandemic is considered inappropriate, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733 000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed that all people's rights are respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group noted that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts noted that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, detained persons, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of governmental support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform for providing comprehensive and timely information on political responses in countries around the world, in addition to views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to address the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the crown virus challenge.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and the son of the president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were dismissed because of their management of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political system to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger by the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the start of the outbreak of coronovirus in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The administration of Donald Trump of the U.S. has referred to the coronovirus as the "China virus" or the "Wuh virus", and stated that "China's discharge overpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distortion of the failure of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government that described a communication strategy with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and cited the strategy as "All about China".
We have been told that we are trying to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television shows. "Communications such as Politician, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and generosity policy."
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested that the United States lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to reports, it sent help to these last two countries.
On 3 April, US sanctions blocked the donation of Jack Ma of 100,000 mascarillas to Cuba.
U.S. authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other countries to their own country.
And there have been reports of mascarilla-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of breathers destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronovirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "China alone responded bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" which claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of undertaking an "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment cover impulse, they may also respond if necessary."
The planned NATO military exercise "defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of the United States troops and the different European countries that participate, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian Government was deeply affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of the infected Parliament, in addition to fifteen current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, saying that his country is having difficulties fighting the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the requirement that the United States adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election possibilities in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts", after Japan announced that any person from South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks on sites designated by the Government.
South Korea's early society was polarized with respect to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand that Moon be dismissed for what they considered to be a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to praise their response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could enable Governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, to suspend Parliament and elections and to punish those who are deemed to have disseminated false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
It was blamed for the outbreak of coronovirus in several cases of shortage of supplies, as a result of the increased use of equipment worldwide to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has published warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to the increased demand of consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several locations also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the empty shelves of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, causing the shortage of supplies.
The technological sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in e-products shipments.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhamom, demand for personal protection equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also resulted in delays of four to six months in the supply of medical goods.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Dalagou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
China and Italy's measures against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful and have avoided an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a considerable reduction, but prices could increase, according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure adequate food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a journalistic report of 16 March, the Chinese economy was badly affected in the first two months of 2020 because of the measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales dropped by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing center, the viral outbreak has been considered a considerable threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts felt that the economic consequences of the global growth epidemic could be overcome by those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate of an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have been "resolved" after a sharp fall in oil prices due to China's lower demand.
On 24 February, global value markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronovirus, several U.S. stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average published its most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow fell 1191 points, the most one-day drop since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but held a negative perspective.
The actions fell again on the basis of the fears of the coronavirus, the greatest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many feel that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British Flybe regional airline collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and transhipment terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important season of travel related to Chinese New Year's holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many tourist events and attractions of the Lunar New Year have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year holiday until 10 February, and ordered most of the places of work not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the highest infectious disease and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected worldwide, with reductions in hours of attention or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
The retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a fall of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a fall of 33 to 43 % in pedestrian transit to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Operators from shopping centres around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in a situation of extreme poverty in Latin America who had remained without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were searched in their homes in inner provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The outbreak of coronovirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to estimates from the San Luis Federal Reserve Bank. Condensation in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households have experienced some kind of unemployment. About 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Almost half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidized by the Government, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term employment compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had an impact on the operations of organizations and on people, both employed and independent, worldwide.
Cultural and arts organizations sought to carry out their mission (often financed from public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions have closed indefinitely worldwide and their exhibitions, events and shows have been cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that increases at an accelerated pace of the disease is the cancellation of religious services. major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which take place during the last week of the season of Christian penance of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live broadcasts via Internet or television, while others offer places to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and then the shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents into sacred places in La Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant change in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the NHL season 2019–20.
The outbreak interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event "will be rescheduled for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other games around the world closed and online poker tournaments were delayed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to resort to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their rates of new registrations. The entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway theaters, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live entertainment, such as live concerts broadcasts or the creation of "festives" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous Internet memes were spread over the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most of the cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered to be a fair reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in ancient feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside the virus.
After the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe that experienced a serious outbreak of the COVID-19, could also be suspected and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions for the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChinaDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the coronovirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered to be racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuaters from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and who study in the main Indian cities, were harassed in relation to the outbreak of coronaviruses.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengala, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took vengeance on them."
China's Consulate in Calcuta then condemned the comments and said they were "misleading." In China, xenophobia and racism were increased to non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign base" and destined for "dejection".
Many newspapers with payment walls removed them for parts or the entire coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the available outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronovirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase, which detects the RNA of the coronovirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence by March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had carried out more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant variations in the number of tests carried out in the various countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affecting the lethality rates for reported cases, which are probably very overestimated in some countries.
Through the polymerase chain reaction with inverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained through several methods, including nasopharyngeal hisopates or spit samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The inverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test performed with pharyngeal hisopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In people infected with the test in the second week, as an alternative, sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory tract by suction catheter, or the material that is excused when coughing (whistle) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was conducted in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the actual reverse-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korea company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
Search for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronavirus and the specific SARS-CoV-2 RRp gene. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the emergency approval of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their diagnostic reaction panel in real-time polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase for the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits produced inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and a stoppage in conducting tests at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only from then on was it possible for state and local laboratories to start testing.
The Administration of Food and Medicinal Products approved the test under an emergency authorisation. The U.S. commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of VOCID-19 tests based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, as at 9 March 2020, this Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at the national level.
No limits were announced in the quantity; the collection of specimens and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the emergency authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Holic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the FDA emergency authorisation for a test which takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plan to increase production to accomplish 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronovirus, with the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
In March 2020, the review of publications concluded that "thorax X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [computed tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms appear."
Typical features in the CT include bilateral multilobar opacity in glass illustrated with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domination develops, a pattern in rot and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared to computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using computed tomography as a method of detection or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDCs recommend the chain reaction of polymerase as an initial examination.
Part of the reaction of the immune system to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and surveillance of the population. Analysis can be done in central laboratories or by testing at the attention point.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories may perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analyses in central laboratories, a single peripheral blood specimen is generally used, although serial specimens may be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained through a puncture in the skin.
Unlike the polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is required before the analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that gave notification to the agency as it corresponded and, therefore, can now distribute its antibody tests.
As at 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received the approval of Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in the blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
The antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody testing kits it bought were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube," the patient spits on the tube, sends it and gets a result soon. The British NHS has announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient infects others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In the tests in drive-through centers for VOCID-19 of suspicious cases, a health professional takes samples with the appropriate precautions.
Drive-through centres have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10 700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to perform 160 000 tests per week.
On 19 March, tests were offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total amount of evidence in Germany was unknown because only the positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, at the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples had been analysed, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9 %) had yielded positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping samples and only making more analysis if the combined sample is positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, BGI launched an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Chino: , or "Fire Eye" in English), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost for dealing with quarantine had doubled without this capacity for testing.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjín, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As at 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Multixated open source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented to assess up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid handling robots.
By March, the shortage and insufficient amounts of reagents affected mass tests in the European Union and the United States.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release genomas of RNA for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that United Arab Emirates was now doing more evidence of coronary artery detection per person in its population than any other country, and was headed to increase the level of testing to cover most of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at Group 42 and BGI population level (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of chain reaction tests of polymerase with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different testing formulas were developed that address different parts of the coronovirus genetic profile in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits that sent low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the available tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of testing kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on the tests.
On the contrary, experts say that the high availability of evidence from South Korea helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private-sector laboratories, over a number of years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of hispopados and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had avoided the execution of private tests. Spain bought test kits to the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to the incorrect collection of samples or the incorrect use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would remove the kits that had yielded incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits to China which turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown to the Danube. Ateş Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them in use". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020, it announced that they were not serving.
The conduct of tests, supplemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of the persons with whom they had had contact who had given positive results in SARS-CoV-2, led to satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death by COVID-19 occurred in Italy, performed two rounds of tests throughout the population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of the people who achieved positive results had no symptoms, and all of the cases detected were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the coronovirus 2020 pandemic in Singapore advanced much slower than in other developed countries, but which did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began recommending residents to stay in their homes, but schools reopened in time after the 23rd of March.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from outside, testing and quarantine, but with less strict confines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have performed more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have lethality rates for much lower cases, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who only have mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to perform tests and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of evidence" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only performs tests in people entering hospitals will have a higher number of positive as % of evidence that a country that performs tests in all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to eliminate dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The washing of hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g. diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via fecal-oral.
People can also get infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If no water or soap is available, the hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing its hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After the nose ring, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, food for animals or waste of animals.
Hand health concerns hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before taking medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand-washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, virus or other microorganisms that may cause a disease) and chemicals that may cause damage or disease from their hands.
This is especially important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronovirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and to reduce the infant mortality rate in births at home.
A study carried out in 2013 showed that improvements in hand-washing practices can generate small improvements in height growth for children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by the introduction of simple changes in behaviour, such as the washing of hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand-washing can reduce diarrhea episodes in about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48 per cent of the reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to hand-washing with soap. Hand-washing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behaviour in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, an important acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and lives are claimed by an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Joint diarrhea and pneumonia account for nearly 3.5 million infant deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into a deep-rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce death by diarrhea to almost half, and to a quarter deaths by acute respiratory infections.
Generally, hand-washing is integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of handwashing is that its frequent realization can cause skin damage due to the restlessness of the skin.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive handwashing can cause skin disease that causes itching and causes skin to become squamous known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too often handwashing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand-washing with soap is important to reduce oral-fetal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (watering, disinfecting), after cleaning a child's tail (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions where a proper hand-washing technique should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or manipulating animals; and after playing garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand-washing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced hand-washing with soap. A study carried out in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 per cent; the United States was close to half with 77 per cent; and China had the lowest rate of 23 per cent. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviour, to increase the adoption of the habit of hand-washing with soap at critical times. Washing hands in groups of children in school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand-wash in child behavior.
The " Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of a tailor-made action to promote the health and education of children.
Drain twice a year, as well as washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The elimination of the micro-organisms of the skin improves by adding soap or detergent water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not easily dissolve into the water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid soap bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Even so, the CDC states that "it is preferable to liquid soap with dispensation controls that do not involve using the hands."
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly promoted to a health conscious audience.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics are using organisms resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
This way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant agent and which protects the skin, the sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (true aloe, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer that contain triclosan to prevent diseases and remove bacteria from the hands.
Nice hot water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water to remove natural oils that hold land and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a water-free agent for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the twenty-first century, the agents for the hygiene of hands without water and with alcohol to rub (also known as the solution for hands based on alcohol to rub, antiseptic solution for hands to rub or disinfectants for hands) began to acquire popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thick agent such as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a glycerine wetter in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol resecting.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases even more antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing between 60 and 95% alcohol at least eliminate germs effectively.
Alcohol-based disinfectants to rub off bacteria, bacteria resistant to several medicines (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based disinfectants containing 70% alcohol remove 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels) from bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) from bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based deinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-based solutions should be used to rub off, such as for wetting or covering completely both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is sequenced.
The fingertips must also be washed well, rubbing them on both palms. The Centers for Control and Disease Prevention of the United States recommend handwashing before the hands disinfectants to rub, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increase in the use of these agents is based on their ease of use and on the rapid phase-out of microorganisms; however, they should not be used as replacement for appropriate hand washing unless water or soap is not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hands disinfectants can dry the skin unless the skin is added emolent or moisturizing to the formula.
The effect of alcohol dryness can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants containing emollients caused significantly lower skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in alcohol-based hand solutions are very rare.
The least tendency to cause contact irritating dermatitis was attractive compared to handwashing with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove the organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcohol-free hands disinfectants depends to a large extent on the ingredients and the formula, moreover, historically, has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to rub.
More recently, it has been found that the formulas that use benzalconium chloride have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or land instead.
Ashes or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of diseases rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand-washing technique recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because water containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to do no difference.
Shake your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when they use soap than when they use water alone.
Refresh for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and restricts more germs during longer periods.
Wash well with running water.
Washing in a container can contaminate your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
The wet and wet hands become contaminated more easily. The parts that are forgotten most often are the thumb, wrist, areas between fingers and under nails
Artificial nails and enamelling of unshelled nails can house microorganisms.
Wetting lotion is often recommended to prevent the hands from resecrating; dry skin may cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
A number of economic options can be used to facilitate hand-washing when there is no running water or soap, for example, pouring water from a hanging cane or a pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home farms" and other economic options.
A home griffon is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jar of a soy and a lever actuated with the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public baths.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, carried out a study sponsored by the association of the European Towels Industry Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers and more modern air jet dryers.
After washing and drying with the hot air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased, on average, 194% in the finger yomes and 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria of 42 % in the fingers and 15 % in the palms.
After washing and drying with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased, on average, 76% in the finger yomes and 77% in the palms. Scientists also performed tests to determine whether cross-contamination of other users of the bathroom and bathroom environment was possible as a result of each type of drying method.
The air dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds, is said to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the micro-organisms of the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air dryer propagated microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study by TÜV Product und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in the count of bacteria after hand-drying were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with disinfectant towels for hands is an alternative during travel, when you have no water or soap.
The alcohol-based deinfectant must contain at least 60 % alcohol.
The hand-washing of doctors became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for disease prevention in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind hospital staff that wash their hands when they are forgotten.
A study found a decrease in infection rates with their use.
The hand washing of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
Hands should be narrowed together between the fingers.
If there are remains below nails, you can use a pig brush to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting further contaminated by those surfaces.
The purpose of hand-washing in the medical care environment is to eliminate pathogens ("generines") and avoid transmission.
According to New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand-washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures may reduce the rate of infection of the catheter-related blood stream by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing handwashing and standard-hand rubbing in the health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organizational hygiene guide can also be found on your website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify the hygiene of the hands if a demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has five moments for hand-washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
After treating patients, the addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap (medicinal soaps or antibacterial soaps) gives the possibility of removal to the handwashing agent.
This elimination may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush for rubbing and another sterilized tool for cleaning under nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
There is no need to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When wetting, the water from the forearms must be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized cloth and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after caring for sick people.
In order to control infections caused by staphylococcals in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand-cleaning is at the first 20 % of washing and that there is very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
Washing with common soap results in more than three times the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution with handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the whipping with alcohol reduced 26 % more the contamination of bacteria than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and Clostridium spores difficult to handle than alcohol-based disinfectants. Interventions to improve the hygiene of hands in health care centres may include empowering staff on hand-washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based disinfectant and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health-care environments.
In developing countries, soap-washing is seen as an economic and fundamental tool for good health and even good food.
However, the lack of reliable supply of water, soap or facilities to wash hands in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behaviours.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, there are very few taps to wash hands near public or private toilets, although there are economic options to build hand-washing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates can also be the result of entrenched habits and not the lack of soap or water.
The promotion of soap-washing can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to a change of behaviour in the long-term population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective in increasing hand-washing in the PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can finally go from one to three stars.
Construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the promotion campaigns of hand-washing that are carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of a conscious campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behaviour. As a result of the coronovirus pandemic 2019-2020, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand-washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting hand washing with soap is considerably more effective than other interventions in water and sanitation.
The importance of hand-washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was recognized for the first time in the mid-20th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called mysmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the incidence of COVID-19 in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of hand-washing with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were hung with "right hand-washing techniques" alongside the washbasins of the public bathrooms and the bathrooms of the office and airport buildings.
The phrase "washing your hands" is a statement that you don't want to take care of anything or share the complicity of something.
It has its origin in Matthew’s Bible passage in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary spot, which represents her guilty conscience over the crimes she had committed and which had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after recalling or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value the elements for hand-washing more.
In addition, those people who have allowed themselves to wash their hands after such reflection, are less likely to engage in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as a volunteer.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without soap, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tévilá and Netilat yadayim in Judaism, washing in Christianity and wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend washing of hygienic hands, in particular after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force themselves to wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam force themselves to wash their hands before and after every meal.
Risk controls at the workplace before the COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace before COVID-19 relate to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in the risk controls for the prevention of coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and on the job and are based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be willing to contract COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal employment contact with the public and fellow workers, for whom basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand-washing, the recommendation that workers stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work at medium exposure risk includes those in which frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who may be infected by the existing Community transmission or by an international trip.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail sales environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective blankets and individual protective equipment available if there is a person with VOVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care workers and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or suspected of having COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected of having VOVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and individual protective equipment suitable for work activity.
The outbreaks of COVID-19 may have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work for getting sick, for having to care for others or for fear of exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both with regard to what goods are claimed and with the means to purchase such goods (such as buying in hours that are not peak, by means of domestic shipping services or by window from the car).
Finally, shipments of articles from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
Plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and risk factors for individual workers, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include reducing the transmission among staff members, protecting people at greater risk of adverse health complications, maintaining trade operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a framework widely used in occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls as effective.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve insulating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to the behaviour of workers and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protection teams are considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent exposures.
All types of individual protective equipment should be selected on the basis of the worker's hazard, be placed as appropriate (e.g. breathers), be used in an appropriate and systematic manner, be reviewed frequently, receive maintenance, be replaced if necessary and be disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Health and Occupational Security Administration (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal employment contacts with the public and fellow workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand-washing, the recommendation for workers to stay at home if they are sick, the rules for respiratory hygiene that include coughing and sneezing, the provision of paperboards and containers for wastes, the preparation for teleworking or step-by-step shifts if necessary, the deterring workers from using tools and equipment outside and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay in their homes until they stop having fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that disease licensing policies be flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a sick relative, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, work at medium exposure risk includes those that require frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who could have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the Community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person made an international trip recently to a place with a generalized transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with a high concentration of people and some environments of retail retail selling environments of large size. Engineering engineering controls for this group and the groups of higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as physical barriers such as transparent plastic cover covers and the placement of a window window window for the service of care service so that the client can request from the car. Administrative controls for this group and the groups of higher risk groups include the installation of high efficiency air filters, the increase of air filters remaining at home, the increase of ventilation rates of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as physical barriers such as virtual communications, the establishment of step-by-step-step-over-step-over-over-over-over-over-over-over-over-over-over-the-road workers, the establishment of physical barriers such workplaces, physical training and training on virtual communication options, virtual communication options, the choices of choices of use, the choices of personnel of personnel, the ability of use of personnel, the use of personnel of personnel, the use, the use of use of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the police, the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role and performance of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the staff of the role of the role of the role of the role and performance of the role of the role of the role of the role of the staff of the staff of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the staff of the role of the role of the staff of the staff of the role of the role and performance of the staff of the role of the role of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the staff of the role and performance of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role and performance of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the staff of the staff of the staff of the role of the role and abilities of the role of the role and performance of the role and performance of the role and performance of the role of the role and performance of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role and performance of the role and performance of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role and performance of the role of the role of the role of the role and performance of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role and performance of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role and performance of the role of the role, the role, the role, the role, the role, the role of the role of the role, the role and performance of the role, the role of the role and performance of the role and performance of skills of skills of of the role of the role of the role, the role of the role and performance of the role, the role and performance of the role and performance of of of of the role of the role of the role, the role of the role of the role of the role of the role, the role, the role of the role, the role of the role of the role of the role of the role and performance of the role and performance of the role and performance of the role and performance of the role and performance and performance of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of the role and performance of the role, the role of the role and performance of the role and performance of the role and performance of the role, the ability of of the role of of of of of of of of of of of the role and performance of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of use of use of use of use of use of skills of skills of skills of skills of the role of the role and performance and performance of the role and performance and performance and performance, the role and performance and performance, the role, the role, the role of the role of the role of the ability of the role of the role, the role of the role of use of use of the role and performance of the role, the role of the role and performance of the role of the role of of skills of use of
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person is ill on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his or her mouth and nose with paper crumbs when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should use disposable surgical gloves to attend a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing the journey by disease, self-insulation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and childcare centres, CDCs recommend short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or chorus education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing space between desks, escalating entry and exit times, limiting visits that are not essential and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For police personnel carrying out daily routine activities, the CDCs consider the immediate risk to health to be low.
Police officers are recommended to contact individuals with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of VOCID-19 to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protection equipment.
If there is close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belts and equipment with a household-use aerosol or toilets before using them again and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgues workers are within high or very high risk of exposure.
High exposure risk work includes those of delivery workers, support, laboratory and medical transport who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of COVID-19.
These become very high-risk exposure works if workers perform aerosol-generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of VOCID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some procedures for generating aerosols are intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests or invasive sampling.
High risk morgue exposure works include those in which workers are involved in the preparation of corpses of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; they become at very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of VOVID-19, even when they are performed aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be adequate in some environments of medical care and morgues.
Samples should be handled using Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering the patient to be separated in different waiting rooms depending on whether they are suspected or not to have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet of the patients who have been infected or suspected that they have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol-generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators should be used with filter mask approved by NIOSH or superior in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program including adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the convenience of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those taking respiratory samples of patients with VOVID-19, they are given attention or transported without performing aerosol-generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or facial protector, coat and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the entry permit to the room of a patient with VOVID-19 only those involved in their direct care, using the same mask without removing it while caring for several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

Subject: [Cvid-19] Lighting the burden and preparing us for the future
DATE/HOURTH: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we are in special circumstances.
The epidemic of COVID-19 highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that constitutes the core of this organization.
The fellowship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues in email messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible the people we have the chance to work with.
I couldn't feel any greater gratitude and pride for all of you to be my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Their work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites running, helping our colleagues get their pay or keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in this, as of this next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to talk about our approach and schedule for the next days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we believed would be an adequate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization right now.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is now an unpredictable place, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, make purchases or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although it shouldn't be necessary to say it, we say it.
It is not necessary to apply for sick leave or paid free time; only inform your manager and help your team to review schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, tell Bryan, T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with the support and make sure that the management is aware of your situation).
People who work for an hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and colleagues who work for an hour.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it is your personal care.
What we ask of you is to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt properly.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are some things we must keep doing.
Site Trust Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fund Retrieval Teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and modify our approach in order to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today will not harm us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "double the hours to catch up" when the pandemic ends.
It will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to set new objectives and deadlines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations for daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that assigns more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care for loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning burdens and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week, and we will report the next steps to the delegates and to the teams just a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues at the San Francisco office could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and lifts that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own protocol of duty of care, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to come back.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office transferred its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our fellow New York City colleagues already know, we have also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing, but they may remain.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely since before know that this modality requires adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of the meetings at intervals of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over a number of days.
clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt the use of the video by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Design a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use welfare reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
The RR.H. Operations Team is analysing the guidelines on ergonomics based on web seminars to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This last week we asked all beneficiaries of Community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editorials, until WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions might make it impossible for them to carry out their part of the activities agreed upon for the grant and that there would be no sanctions for delaying or modifying those objectives.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidelines in Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems, in part, to be sadness over interruption and, in part, relief from clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT will be working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact in relation to COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 2:00 p.m., coordinated universal time/07:00 p.m. Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting each other.
We're in this together and we're available to help out the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information about this email message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up-to-date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries currently heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, a coverage problem or anything you may need help with, do not hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If they have confidential or sensitive matters, send an email to Bryan Judah, Director of International Operations of RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, it is a recognition that, at this moment, our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will remain there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support one another and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of your families so that they can be in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the lungs cells, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (AEC) related by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic diana for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as an entry point for cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme containing zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal Peptidease M2 domain and a C-terminal renal transporter of glycerine amino acids.
ECA2 is a single-type I membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is excreted from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, soluble protein is released in the blood stream and ultimately excreted by the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of type II alveolar cells of the lungs, to the enterocytes of the small intestine, to the arterial and venous endothelial cells and to the smooth muscle arterial cells of most organs.
The MARN expression of ECA2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatic body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to counter the ECA.
The ACE causes angiotensin I hormone to go out and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 is excreting carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysing it to form vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 may also burn several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinin, amenine, neurotensine, dinorphine A and greline.
ECA2 also regulates membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main point of entry for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 spiga protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes found within the cells.
This process of entry also requires the preparation of S protein by the host TMPRSS2 protease serum, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that the reduction of ECA2 levels in cells could help combat infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing standard ACE and BRA inhibitory therapy.
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 determined that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34 % of pneumonia risk compared to control cases".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with cerebrovascular accidents and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolyaccharides.
The average life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour effect (duration).
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising medicine for those people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated. The infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronovirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who might have been in contact with a infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
A number of frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular, in relation to systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to admit these Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will give it to the government. In Northern Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that contact tracking was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCvid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetric application for patients living in Moscow and have received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, presented several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false-positive and possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add cronavirus related applications to its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the consequences of massive surveillance through the application of the coronovirus and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the cronovirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communiqué to require limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extensions of monitoring and monitoring would have to have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
safety and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of this protection;
digital monitoring should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protection against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to such abuse should be implemented;
The significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) from Germany also published lists of controls.
The proposed plan by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when no longer needed.
In some countries, a network-based location tracking was used instead of applications, which eliminated both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, networking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created using central servers only for intercommunication (see below).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made the location information available to the public, which is permitted due to the wide-ranging changes to the information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, have considered using centralized systems and privacy protection systems.
The details have not yet been published as of 6 April 2020.
The tracking of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of published research dating back to 2013 at least. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralised and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PTP/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as contact event numbers, CEN) and mobile contact tracking protocols and mechanisms for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never departs from the device and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy by collecting and using data from location or intersection of routes to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Out of Control Applications: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an Epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, a number of groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly coincident protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, a key aspect for broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for tracking contacts that, as they assured, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, it is intended to implement the system in three stages:
implementation of the tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the problems of adoption and persistent surveillance by distributing, first, the system through updates of the operating system and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'The reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the rehabilitation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the disease for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with the scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and covalent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
The analysis of these joint sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are the protease similar to papaine, RNA polymerase directed by RNA, helicase, S protein, and ribofosphatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquina is an anti-malignant drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by an emergency authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized according to a US only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
The doctors said they use the drug when "there's no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, major studies are under way.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen affirmed that favipyravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a Wuhan study in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipyravir, while the other half was given umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug to Japan for its reserves and use the military to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with CVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on drug purchase. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those who try to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticisms have emerged about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international study Solidarity.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple philovirus, neumvirus, paramixovirus, and coronovirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in a more serious disease and transmission.
Some initial pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two hospitals from the University of Cleveland; one for people with moderate and another for those with a more severe disease.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are ongoing for people who are hospitalized and seriously affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with azithromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin’s Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronovirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is in progress and 200 serious hospitalized patients will be enrolled in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COPID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is registering 6000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COPID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women who are breast-feeding or who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on their use.
On 14 April, a multicenter study with 300 patients was announced in Italy to investigate the use of sodium enoxaparin at preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying close attention to the rehabilitation of antiviral drugs that developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SARG and Western Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that were identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (block the IL-6 receiver): approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop this vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
An important outbreak spread across the world in 2020, triggering considerable investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, ECI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were being investigated and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the dianas of the main platforms that went on to phase I security studies are the following:
nucleic acid (ADN and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
According to ECI scientists in April, a total of 115 possible vaccines are at the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (it is assumed to be planned or developed).
A Phase I or Phase II test performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, are placebo controlled and is performed at several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and assess the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active developing vaccines (confirmed early in April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (continued in the "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly subjected vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of Saskatchewan University announced the start of work on a vaccine and hopes that the human tests will begin in 2021.
Projects for vaccine development were announced at China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at Hong Kong University on 28 January.
About 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is corollating an oral vaccine with his biotech associate, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in treatment with neo-antigenic cancer vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that the vaccine synthesis had been completed and that the tests were starting.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that he was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in San Luis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both west of Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that he had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a Phase I clinical trial and trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated people and that, although moving fast, it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to the coronovirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The potential vaccine is at the laboratory investigation stage and human tests are expected to start in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'great amounts of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19", before which the German Government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to develop a joint RNA-based vaccine.
The possible BNT162 RNA-based vaccine is currently in preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of the preclinical tests in April 2020 and that the human tests of the possible final vaccine could begin in autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance against COVID-19 involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and Pittsburgh University, leading to the total investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other ECI partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officers announced that scientists began testing animals of six possible vaccines.
Researchers from the London Imperial College announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing an ARN vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, including a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the initiatives of Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another outbreak of coronavirus occurred.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh's Faculty of Medicine announced the PittCoVacc tests, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "the vaccines of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 administered by MNA obtained powerful responses from the specific antibodies of antigens (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a probable nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacterium and produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the industrial sector and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, together with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomised essay in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
The initial investigations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with COVID-19-specific animal models, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, show the need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARG that has proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat RAAS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no confirmed SROM vaccine.
When the SROM was generalized, it was believed that the existing research on SARG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, a SROM vaccine (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, another three were in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviric vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVA) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus causing the COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by several publications on social media refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other crownvirus strains, such as the SARA coronavirus.
b'The coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronovirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organic insufficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur while coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets occur when exhaling, they usually fall on the floor or on the surfaces, instead of being contagious in long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although propagation is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the chain reaction of polymerase with inverse transcription in real-time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hisopate.
It is recommended that masks be used for those suspected of having the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend not to use them, others recommend that they be used, while others demand their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips. If these symptoms are presented, seek medical attention immediately.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, nasal drip and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented oppression in the chest and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorganic insufficiency, and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period of the COVID-19 is usually between five and six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of the infection. Not all of the infected are reported to have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who have no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both the spit and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speak aloud releases more drops than when talking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering the mouth while coughing can make the droplets travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the corridor outside the dormitories of people gave positive in viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may lead to aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spread through stools, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not quite clear how easy it is to spread, a person usually infects two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergent are also effective if used properly. The soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after initiation of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Ceronvirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Ceronvirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related coronoviruses.
Outside the human body, the domestic soap kills the virus, as it revives its protective bubble. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, due to the virus entering host cells through the angiotensin Type 2 converting enzyme (ECA2), which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is most common in the severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptom rates are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease evolution, but acute myocardial injury may be related to heart receptor ECA2.
ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in their operation.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a bad prognosis. In the autopsies of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrations with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropics for epithelial cells expressing ECA2 from the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that the secretory T lymphocytes of GM-CSF pathogens are correlated with the recruitment of IL-6 secretory monocytes and a severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, lymphocytic infiltrations were also reported.
WHO has published several testing protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the chain reaction of polymerase with inverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done in samples of the respiratory pathways obtained through nasopharyngeal hisopate; however, samples of nasal or spit hisopates can also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronovirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories in the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PRC) tests to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
The experience in China with the tests has shown that the accuracy is only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 to use it at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan would suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral multilobular glacial crystal with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in the initial stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domination may appear, pattern in disordered rotting (septal lobulillar thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macrocopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large neumocyte, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and giant cell formation with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASD) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavitys and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation spread (CID); leukorethroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with water and soap frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and, if you do not have handkerchiefs, use the inside of the elbow.
Appropriate hands hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth taps in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling public meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. Since there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as soon as, a key part to control the COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "planning the curve".
The CDC also recommends washing hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, in particular after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with a minimum of 60 % alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available in time. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to achieve, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for antisepsis of the hands".
Glycerol is added as moistant.
Patients are given support care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus use a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OCEC) has been used to address the respiratory failure problem, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COPID-19.
Intensives and neumologists in the U.S. compiled recommendations from several agencies on a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend the liketaminophen (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be exercised to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care environments when procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation, are carried out.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals take care of people with VOCID-19 place the patient in an AIR area, in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. The CDC highlights the guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (EPP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipments are EPP coat, mask, protective fronts and medical gloves. When available, the respirators are preferred (instead of the masks).
The N95 mascarillas are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorised their use by means of an urgent authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but there is no guarantee of effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not specified in the product indications.
When there are no masks available, CDCs recommend the use of protective scars or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is actively being studied for people hospitalized with respiratory insufficiency related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal canal or positive bipression in the respiratory pathways.
It is still not known whether either of these offers the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the propagation of aerosol particles compared to the high flow nasal canal. Serious cases occur mainly in older adults (aged 60 years and, in particular, older 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough head beds in hospitals, which limits the ability of the health system to manage the sudden increase in severe cases of CVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COPID-19 has acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators with different modes of pressure control and PPTE are needed to maximize the supply of oxygen, while the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax is minimized.
The oldest respirators may not count on high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take up to 2021, several medicines that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe illness.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in tests of the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to the plasma of convalescent as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "close contact" and thus a potential risk of infection by means of surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-confineration, but also alerts local health officers. Analysis of mobile information macrodatas, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those with whom they were in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track the data from mobile phones of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and to protect those who can come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data on the location of phones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine failures.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile telephone operators have informed him that "in any case, 40% of people continue to travel."
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hackatón with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the propagation of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxiety about quarantine, travel restrictions and side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for mental health and well-being of people."
The disease may follow a slight evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will look like other diseases in the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take from three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of serious infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARG and SROM, but the data from COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to the respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDR) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorganic insufficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorder and heart, kidney and liver damage.
The change in coagulation, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while renal function alteration is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to ICU, the average length of seven days between hospitalization and death elapsed.
In an incipient case study, the average time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to the death was 14 days, with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among males was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exude cell fibromixoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, cardiac damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of disease mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The insufficient count of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or to die compared to non-smokers. They worry about the long-term sequelae of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30 per cent decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ damage.
This can also cause the syndrome after intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in persons recovering from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases recovered from the COVID-19 have been reported that later gave positive in coronaviruses.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, through an interspecific infection.
Real origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as at 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned IEC-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate is 6.9 % (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed persons who die from a disease, and the lethality rate in infected persons, which reflects the percentage of infected persons (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information on how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger, so there was a relatively low mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 may have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, nearly 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died by COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only at 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 among males and 1.7 among women.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lowest number of women who smoke, and the fact that men have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age, could have contributed to the highest mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of the people infected were male and 72% of the people who died by COVID-19 were male.
By April 2020, the U.S. Government did not track sex information in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and RAG, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and have more exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhamom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations is called to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called a coronary artery of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
It is common that coronavirus is used to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "Whan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hisopos and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a respirator and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves during the night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, there were conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation on the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that quickly spread over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, or chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARID Test to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds in effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus get into the receptor ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains a harmless copy of the virus genetic code that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
By April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven studies evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs are most of the Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries, and are due to report by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible drugs against COVID-19 was under way. Several antiviral medicinal products are evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
By March 2020, there is evidence of attempted efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquina, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer review for the investigation.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that twice the dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation for use for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of treating physicians of patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
More in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial S protein barley that performs type 2 transmembrane serine-protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with receptor ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent cytokines from being released. China’s National Health Commission included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after the completion of a small study.
It is found in a non-randomised national phase II test in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe illness.
It is expected that, in combination with an analysis of serum ferritin blood to identify cytokine releases, you counteract these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleucin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine-release syndrome, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes in 2017.
To date, there is no non-randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for the CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from the COVID-19 is being investigated to people who need it as a passive immunization method without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the SARG with non-concluding results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action through which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibodies-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
Convalescent serum production, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve faster distribution.
