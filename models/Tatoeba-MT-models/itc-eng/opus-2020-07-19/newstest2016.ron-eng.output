UN Chief declares there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the conflict that has lasted for almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions.
The UN Chief again requested all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries in the Council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation unresolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they were able to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 figures from polls showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others wait for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to give Donald Trump to the top of the polls, it didn't work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed that Donald Trump leads with a percentage of two digits and some voices begin to seriously wonder what this means for the numbering odds of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the nomination of Republicans.
Pundits showed that, at the same time in 2011, Rick Perry's advance took place in polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard at the general elections are numerous.
But the outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Next we present you some figures from recent surveys suggesting that the real estate model is not just something that goes by:
Figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the middle of June, a survey by the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate model.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Today, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A survey carried out last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for nomination.
In a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of the Republicans said they would be "entuziasmati" or "thank you" if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "surprising" if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say it would be "entuzities" compared to 40% that say the same thing about Trump).
The closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they would be "unthankful" or "sorry" if Jeb Bush's favorite wins the race for nomination.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temper a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for the insults and his bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe that the property mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the poll conducted on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in the state of Iowa, where 52% of the Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe that he does not have the necessary personality to act efficiently and almost six out of 10 independents claim that his temperament does not have what he is looking for in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When I take the intellectuals' attitude, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, the question of who has the most chance to win the race for GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed to the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, the GOP voters did not read the future very well.
At the same time as last election, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or replicated to another candidate, Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while supporting Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted at the beginning of September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from the majority support.
Trump is located at a distance of 13 points by Carly Fiorina, at 14 points by Marco Rubio, at 15 points by Walker, at 19 points by Jeb Bush and finally at 33 points compared to Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who wins him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one-by-one confrontation.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey carried out on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% claims to leave the door open to changing its option.
However, Trump's biggest opponent is currently the Ben Carson neurosurgeon, but it's twice as likely as voters who say they've decided to vote with Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violators" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration was the central subject of the 2016 campaign.
Some are worried that Trump's bomb style will lead to a clash between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will damage the rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
So, it seems as long as the problem of immigration remains in the light of the reflectors, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration against authorities reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the survey carried out on Monday by ABC/Post, six of the 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone experienced in government.
People are also angry at the Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the provision of the Republics of the Congres, 54% declaring themselves "unthankful" and 21% "muffled to the top".
Jeremy Corbyn made his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be examined closely by the media and Labour MPs.
During weekly appearances, he called for “less theatre and more facts”.
He also said that he could give up a few participations and give up his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in leadership position, coming after he called it a "ghost cabinet" and after the speech he held on Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Party leader to keep silent at the address of the national anthem in a service held on Tuesday on the occasion of the anniversary of 75 years of the Battle of England attracted criticism from conservative parliamentarians and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said that he "contained silence in a respectful manner" and acknowledged "the heroism of British Air Forces in the Battle of England."
But a member of the ghost cabinet of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, said for the show Two's Newsnight transmitted by BBC that the Labour leader would be recommended to sing the national anthem "no matter" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing by differences of opinion related to the economy, defence and external, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, states that the differences in the policy "cumulate" in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr Corbyn regarding his position with regard to the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would eliminate the idea of limitation in its entirety.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party “is very clear” in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the “head” level from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says that he has “outsiders” ideas for questions to address to Mr. Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North stated that PMQs involves too high a level of confrontation and that it will refrain from reprisals and attacks, engaging in exchange to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, would take his place at PMQs when he could not participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moved abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the occasional word, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this aspect.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" that was often associated with PMQs, but he recognized a few years later that he failed in his own way.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, of the way in which it leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although the critics say it has become a cartoon and it needs a profound reform.
« Framework in Joburg »: Young homeless people benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and win their life.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people to take pictures of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage enlargement
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says that a rise in the minimum wage in Britain could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, that purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs in the company, he says.
Costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the "furt" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves rather words of praise and not criticism, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged in the light of the reflections by the scandalous effect Kyrgios had on Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a quadrant game played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to break up Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios down, and I should have put this kid down."
Although he was last seen making a dust rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry with Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the second place individually, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal Davis Cup against England.
“One thing I feel strong about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted to conflict a little bit,” Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration against himself and I know Thanasi well enough that I know he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, it has been very well mastered in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think it deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, working hard and integrated into the team, having no conflict with the other players, he's highly respected at dressing, he's very hard, he's in excellent shape, he's a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and shortcomings.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important drawback game that began on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the player from Canberra to the long-term team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the game and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he matured under the eyes of the public and made some terrible mistakes and deserved to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time when he's not at the center of attention to be able to reflect, good for both the team and him.
Elections 2016: The advantage of Hillary Clinton in front of Bernie Sanders has been halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins land.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down 58%), while Sanders is in second place, 27% (up compared to 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced that he will be a candidate for the presidency, is supported by 15% of democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are firmer in their choice than other candidates' supporters.
Faced with the CBS news survey last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderators, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support for men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the best interests of older voters.
Last month, Clinton was standing in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two digits, among the liberals, but Sanders now has an easy five-point advantage in this group.
About half of the democratic voters at the national level say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if he were chosen to run on behalf of the party.
One quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters are excited about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first grade, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would want to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
In view of the vice-president's consideration of a possible candidate for the presidency, 57% of the Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third do not think he should run.
On the question of the second option for the party's representative, democratic voters call Biden the majority.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run the race in the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders grows, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn't run.
55% of the Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the greatest chance to win the general elections; but the figures fell from 78% as they were last month.
Biden is located at a distance in the second place, but the percentage according to which it is the most eligible has grown.
However, when asked what is most important to a chosen candidate, democratic voters prefer issues instead of eligibility.
As in last month, no democratic or possible candidate is considered by these electors to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well with regard to a few key features of their party’s primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trustworthiness and strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen best of all three with respect to integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is fully and reliable, twice as many as those who declare this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have a view about him in this regard.
Democratic voters generally consider that the three Clinton, Sanders and Biden have the same ideologies as they do.
In all these respects, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
How do the questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton while he was Secretary of State, most democratic voters are pleased with his explanation on the subject and say that he did not affect their general view of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that this email-related controversy has not affected them in general about Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they've changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton whole and reliable, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% considers it integrity and trust, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in more than in more.
62% of the electors do not consider it whole and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump whole and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush are classified first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integrity is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, however, as in Carson’s case, many do not think about him.
The error margin for the 351 sample of primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternity charged for the student's murder in the year 1 of the Faculty of Baruch
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during a initiation ritual in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains, five people were charged with murder.
Members of Pi Delta Psi's College of Baruch New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, as reported by the police.
Official sources say that the victim was tied to the eye, put a 14 kg sand-filled backpack behind him, and was bloated repeatedly while trying to get to a target on an frozen field.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches and lost consciousness.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternal did not call the emergency number after he passed out and claim to have waited an hour before he went to the hospital, the police said.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the brotherhood at the national level, to ask for advice, the chief of police, Chris Wagner, told a press conference.
“At this point, members began to hide personal goods and put the good of the brotherhood before Michael Deng’s good,” Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trunks and thighs.
"A lot of families have been devastated by fraternal rituals, since 1970 at least one student lost his life every year because of rituals," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with murder of grade three.
Another thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged for outrage and crime.
“We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it responsible,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Faculty of Baruch prohibited the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its membership with the local representation.
Here's what happens when the Federal Reserve increases interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the market bubble (growing market) will suffer, the profitability of the bonds will increase and the economy will enter recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history gives little clues to time frame..
After the first increase in interest rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That is why US central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on the moment when they begin to raise interest rates but on the trajectory of the time needed for standardisation.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in the game.
But in the end, market players could see that all the agitation related to interest rate growth has been exaggerated.
"The first increase in interest rate decided by Fed after the global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some voices as a sign of the "cheese money" era," said Julian Jessop, the economist head of the Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that all seem to be afraid of.
But it can't be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how a few sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation that the market has faced in recent months, anticipation of interest rate growth can vaporize things for a while.
But at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for the return on capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect the defamation of monetary policy again," said analysts Deutsche Bank in a recent study on what will happen after Fed growth.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has suddenly increased - with about 14 percent - to increase interest rate, quite invariable over the period of 250 days after (averagely 2.6%) after it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche stated that the impact on actions tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits are beginning to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life but increasing interest rates often contributes to it.
In the present situation, Fed faces some conditions that had not existed before and could accelerate a recession.
More precisely, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was lower than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time it's different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing for an Fed growth decision all year long, with all eyes being focused on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which closes Thursday.
Although many strategies and economists believe that the WTO could approve an increase in interest rate on the occasion of this meeting, the term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study after 1950, all interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, GDP eclipses the peaks before the recession very fast after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the most serious recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by Fed from the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of obligations, it appears that the benefits change direction as soon as the first cycle growth/decrease occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the profitability of the obligations falls immediately," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will lead to the approximation of the profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, by flattening the curve.
Obligations with high profitability are better done in such an environment, although “we are still cautious about forcing profitability,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes the markets have already adapted to Fed's expectations.
"Aside from the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the return on profitability is higher, the spread of the average interest rate of credit has expanded and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when Fed asserts politics.
In large lines, the companies that carry out their majority activity in the USA will have to gain from the increase in interest rate and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the rise in the dollar will lead to the price of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that “quality” stocks tend to be more profitable within three months of an initial increase in interest rate,” analyst Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.
Strong-balance sheet firms exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital revenues and low volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), and 3 (percentage points).
Duty will become an important problem.
Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also gain from the rise of the dollar.
Those who save may also have won, although experts do not agree on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for "protesting"
It says it is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the Brits prizes.
Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that neither this show is original
BBC Radio 3 "turns into" Classic FM, said an important parliamenter, putting pressure on the position to prove that he does something that commercial posts do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also informed the BBC chiefs that the public radio station "protests" and resembles the commercial opponent more and more.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 "protests" - although I don't like to use the word - but I think it's becoming Classic FM," he said.
It also took BBC Music Awards, released last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Brits under another name.
So, if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that only copy what already exists on the market," said Mr Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent regarding live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anywhere about the classical music I'm learning from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new pieces," he said.
In the first part of this year, editor BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said he had to make more efforts to attract the audience to the earlier period because the British had less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC label criticized during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would go to the tracks of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC-purchased talent show from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be performed "in a specific BBC manner."
He added that he wanted that Corporation to “find the golden hen in its own liking” next time he launched a entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future taking of new seasons from The Voice or to spend money that goes to licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month there has been the slowest growth from 2000 to now.
Online sales took over three years ago because of the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Specialists are of the opinion that the November Black Friday could determine reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned British commercial streets into ghost cities.
But specialists say that there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total of the money spent in August showed the lowest growth from 2000 to now, with a growth of only 5% over the past year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the growth level from the previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalise over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index, said Guardian.
He explained that online sales took over three years ago, when buyers started using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it is stagnating a little, you might notice a decrease (growing).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for a decrease in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers crashed in front of computers to put their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of multiple retail sites.
Specialists believe that Black Friday, when buyers have beaten the chilippers, could result in the reluctance of buyers.
A study published by British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 out of every £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently made via online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy online clothes and shoes than to go to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the sanctioning of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed following the fall of the macara in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives have been roamed on Muslim streets, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially blamed the giant in Saudi Binladin Group construction for the collapse.
The Minister of Health said that 394 people were injured following the fall of the macara
In the street-walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a macara collapsed at the Mecca mosque.
Dressed in white, those who complained of death joined the road to express condolences, until the first dead arrived at the end of the final journey at the Al-Moassem cemetery.
The sad reminder kept by the holy place, where only a few days ago a building crane collapsed through the mosque's ceiling, falling down the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the construction group of the Bin Laden family for disaster, which was also fought by 394 wounded.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a macara collapsed at the Mecca mosque.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pilgrimage when the macarau collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Moschee Sea with his parents before starting the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still reaching the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group shouldn't have left the crane's arm high when the crane wasn't working.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not present that detail, but stated that the company leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Previously during this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macara collapse in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements on the collapse of the macarale and representatives of the Group could not be contacted for the declarations.
The royal decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and did not coordinate its activity with the meteorological authorities.
Tens of cranes surround the Mecca Moschee, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with Saudi Arabia's royal family and is carrying out major construction projects.
The last leader Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegated" son of the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to take part in pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of each fit-physical Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people stay in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased victims would receive one million Saudi Riali (174,000 pounds) and that the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will get half of this amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of the conversion of loans into Swiss francs
On the bank market, two loans to the Swiss francs have already been available, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come over a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
Bank Transylvania has just closed the credit conversion process in Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the offer of conversion for its customers.
According to data compiled by financial portal analysts FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest to lei, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank's conversion offer was accepted by 83% of franc credit customers due to the second successive reductions: the balance with the value of risk commissions and customer-paid administration was reduced, and an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the lei balance.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the equivalent monthly board in lei before conversion.
Thus, Bank Transylvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bankpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the collection of credits in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from the future growth of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which his salary is settled.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that property reassessment is not made, additional guarantees are no longer required and another proof of income.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the loan and there will be no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a reduction in the monthly rate, as much as the customer's plate before conversion, equivalent to the lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is made up more of the interest, and the client repays very little of the main.
Very small interest bankpost offer in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
You don't know how this will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest rates is that the ROBOR index will grow significantly in the following years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR three months ago is 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to show other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for the decision on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks at the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, a little over half that last week thought that the decision would be taken, I think now that the situation will continue for a while and interest rates will be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation in which a major central bank could abandon the zero rate and initiate a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, bringing back trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
See that they've lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has been in stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer in 2009.
It is also rumored that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly has a cost.
The player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is on the bar for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at his right foot in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of the PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following an unexpected intervention by Héctor Moreno in minute 15, after Shaw, 20 years of age, broke the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture on his foot and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then he'll be operated in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, has difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something like this happens.
His oxygen mask was put in the locker.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at the double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped from the red cardboard and the concession of a punishment strike.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say it's fault and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: “Thank you all for messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, starting my way to recovery, I will come back stronger.”
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's accident in defeat of PSV
The foundation of the team of England has an added reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, coach PSV, said: “It’s a very ugly accident.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never try to attack an opponent.
Moreno broke his foot playing for the Mexican national against the Dutch nationals led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
“It’s very hard because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it’s a very serious accident, it’s not right,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I couldn't see but the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In the SBS6 statement, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel so bad. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission, but he's still holding fast.
Pakistan’s victory in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing England’s selected tournament team, I do not take a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test games.
I wouldn't eliminate any variant of a win on the move.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good spin players in the batting line and collective morals is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left the England team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his principal coach at Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze my decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven games test against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no signs of questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - the players are their own selectionrs.
Some fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he'll have some other opportunities.
The main coach of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not as much as his ability and did not surprise me; first of all, he is a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman gets noticed in the test games.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and on the way.
The only misunderstanding you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in full shape - but that missed opportunity is in the past.
The team's coming Alex Hales, a batsman I care about very well.
He's a cricket player who has "X factor" and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched for Moeen to open up with Cook, which would take extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a thrower couldn't hit there and this left player already proved he's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was no. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games test 38 as first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team on the spinner back-up post and, although I had a limited contact with him, it hit me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his old age - with an average of 31 at the beating and 35 at the ball - and they could think it's a point, but there's no bunch of spinners and the pickers chose for the youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has brought some changes to the coach team.
Mahela Jayawardene's name, batsman from Sri Lanka, as consultant for the test matches could be a master hit.
It's one of the best players and it'll bring you a lot of experience, as it's played in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both energy and unbeatable ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if it sends messages that have been transmitted and previously, they can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes rests for one day's games, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although not all of them agree, coaches and selectees do not do the program.
And you have to hold back, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made easy.
Camp Brexit could have a cause if the economy remained in calm by 2017
As David Cameron's renegotiating strategy to maintain the UK's EU is becoming increasingly confusing, even without Jeremy's brilliant "Yes or No" choice, Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
One European diplomat explained last day that - plunged into crises similar to that of the EU - not all of which are internal - some Member States are fed on the agenda of Great Britain's concessions and amendments to the Treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they did not want this either if they would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the chancellor participates in bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capital, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with an external perspective under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that more ministers and officials obtained from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German super-precautionary Chancellor, is an ally, but he has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave his position before her situation crumbles, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English people who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from coming out of Britain - a thing they do not want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers could even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegotiation has been fixed" and "British Sea has not obtained any value from renegotiation".
The Europeans know on their skin how captivating they can be Fleet Street and how skeptics are the barons of the oligarchic press that regard the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our entry from 1973 in report 2:1.
Perhaps I can remember vaguely from Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was co-host in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of non-tax payers, foreigners who cheated telephone and pseudo non-domes that hold most important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him a ticket.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me back on Monday at Westminster - I told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's boycotting strategy from the egg, a mistake then and now.
It may last, but it must develop a coherent strategy of media cooperation, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left a vacancy on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position with regard to Europe is what I would call evolutionary.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with the conservatives could agree with that.
That's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher from him fought not to acknowledge that John McDonnell's appointment by Corbyn as a shadow minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his job in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “in any situation” - Benn’s expression does not match what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians at the private meeting of Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to transmit - hold, sensitize me and me - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the spin of social networks, a focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing him to take the workers' support in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But the basic sophism of McDonnell and Corbien on the EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his NATO sophism - Tom Watson is untiring about the fact that JC will not campaign for waiver - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin be wasted political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already sufficiently disappointed about the poor military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as reminded me of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists Criticise Decision of the Department of Public Health in England on Electronic Cigarettes
According to researchers, claims by a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of which have links in the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published last month's "reference" report and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of data and pointed to the link between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinary base of fragility” that he founded PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in the BMJ questioned the claims and substantiated them “on solid land or moving sand”.
Martin McKee, European Public Health Professor at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that it is expected that the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell or claimed that one of the meeting sponsors was a company named EuroSwiss Health, about which executive director was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for conducting an independent study.
It also validated BAT's public health accreditation in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer but not the funding that there are reports that it would have received from the tobacco and tobacco-producing company, Philip Morris International.
There were no arguments on the basis of which panel members were selected, but among them are a number of known "companies" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the work of financing the industry.
Other meeting participants are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
The Chief of the Tobacco Control Section of the PHE also participated at the meeting.
The research work carried out by the group "convincingly musalises" that they lack "solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have according to most criteria", said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE claims that "there is still no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE Health Department, said that he had responded in the past to the claims in BMJ.
He said: "Electronic fires are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of two people who smoked all their lives lost their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic health cigarettes is less comparative, but we must continue to study long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that comes out and those that does not come out of evidence, in particular given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related disease and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking amount to 2 billion pounds.
By clearly expressing the current evidence - that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not risk-free, they only present a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfill our national duty.

Complaints that shame Britain's arms trade
Follow the film by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones!
Fiery for the crushing of the ankles!
Bombs with dispersions!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving traces!
The merry voice and animated images do not leave any doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms trade is an enormous charade, made by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities' desire to sell weapons to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

However, a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in the bus stations and in the metros that need a second look.
"Important announcement, travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the sources and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will bow to DLR Clients are asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group named Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 pound Allen key package that states that "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet."
The London Transport Region is not amused by this "vandalism" as a steering wheel.
One of the parody announcements produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make the political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaboration with protest activists, realizing that they have to go into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets shuttles traveling by subway.
The film produced by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the commercial for the arms trade - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the realization of a more realistic commercial, but “enriching it with powerful animations and colors, it was more habitive.”
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment in the trade," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and to ensure that torture equipment is not marketed illegally and delivered at the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms trade comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab issued an order received from the US army on “AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped foci that offers stunning effects behind the gunfire, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules to Live in Home
It's been 11 years since I moved to my home, while I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in beer and moral relativity, but I barely remember the forced smiles of those who were angry -- and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can lead to states that vary from nervous breakdown to terror.
Laughing is tempting: telling people where you live, if and where you spent a year of study break, how you feel about Corbyn, and why “you are honest, regardless of whether you are Marmite because, really boys, it’s nothing other than extract from HAHAHA, you find me in my room.”
Breathe deep.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
These souls talk and help you to differentiate the people you like from those you would not talk to even if the tree would come and they would be the only ones that would have boats.
Don't choke people.
Sleepers often abound with drinking parties, film series and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people get dressed and try their underwear.

Obviously, if you wipe someone's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put it in tea is still stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve yourself even if it boils on the inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying and I understand you - you're still trying to address the problem more mature than my roommate, who has colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who have stolen.
He's in jail now.
Don't make noise that won't let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it feels good, it's because you're going on your own.

Of course, you can't oppose your heart - but if a sexy chaperone is certainly not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
The minute you realize that someone left their keys in the unlocked room, the line between psyche and intimidation is finer than it seems.
A successful prank is fun, but it can denture in a few moments.
You teach a funny and valuable lesson about safety hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but do not glue the goods of someone's ceiling more than twice.
Violent David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a solist but also as an initiator of a less ordinary project, right "city", as he even says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who interpret a symphonic repertoire without having a director, and that makes it to be at least a curiosity in classical music.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, Sunday, in which solist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when the violinist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu were overlooked.
Both performances, performed on Athens's scene, showed the public a different way to play classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, at that time being the only classical musical ensemble in which there is no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become beggars, or to be an orchestra interpreter - I'm talking about instrumentalists, and not composers.
They're trained as "specialized workers".
They themselves feel like they need a director.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the fetishization music focuses on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, makes their marketing.
So, we're not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have on one side skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but we have to watch, what is stupid again," considers David Grimal.
The violinist tells us that this change in the way he does music came after the "musical disappointments" of his solist career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to win a lot of money and to bring money and the music industry.
After 10 years, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found creativity and human fraternity in this system.
So, we haven't found any sense of continuing on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did this without a director: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do I imagine you make marketing with a group of musicians where there's no ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", specifying that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a trap in the musical act: "In curious way, the more complex we sing a repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are forced to be present in the opera and not only in the role," says Grimal, adding that to Sunday's show "I was 74 directors on the stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", just because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the largest orchestras in the world are present that sing and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you also invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest for something different, that breaks barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist recognized as the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but that happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanesque music, "for there is also a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal is campaigning for the change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the musical set, as it is organized today, has an ice of death" and as "the future of music represents the music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it doesn't serve anything.
Back in Bach's time, there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, they're all great, extraordinary, but as long as they're doing music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity is suffering, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had vegetables and good meat."
To enter the EU, you had to adopt health laws that were not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are in the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
With music happening the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances may not be very beautiful, but when we cut them they are real red.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce his learning into school, we reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we no longer need to sell music by-products," says Grimal.
Surely there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that all over the world, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - no.red.) it must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's something else.
After your appearance, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?", asked the French artist smilebind.
Grimal looks like, for artists, the reward of a different kind of making music comes from the passing of this "soldier" status, exceeding what "you think are their limits": "Musicians discovered at a certain time that they are not soldiers, and that is why after the concert there are scratches."
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and about his vision of music and the artist at the "Ideal Festival", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romanian Institute.
David Grimal's Profile
After following the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the direction of Regis Pasquier, during which he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at School des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting with Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed his life course.

Alongside his solo artist career, David Grimal had to explore and more personal projects.
The freedom he offered his collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe through adventure in repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
In addition to Les Dissonances, he set up "L'Autre Season", a series of concerts given for the benefit and together with people without staying at the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.

David Grimal was present Sunday at the International George Enescu Festival this year together with the Les Dissonances Orchestra, in the program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also got on stage Monday, this time with the violinist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "The Little Voci Mari"
Cinema City launches the greatest challenge for children: the dubling of two characters from the superproduction "Creasa Zăpezia 3D"
Do you have a super-talented, spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him the chance to get the star.
In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, they want to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years of age, Cinema City is looking for "Small Voices Mari", offering them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in classical drawings the focus was on approaching the voice of the actor of the specific animated character, in the last period, the story creation is considered and those who are about to interpret the voices, and they are usually well known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are starting an unpublished campaign.
We want to find the right voice and provoke parents to join their children in our contest.
They'll have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the challenges are fun.
"The boys will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania said.
In the first stage of competition, between September 11th and September 30th, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be selected who will have the opportunity to test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the smallvoicemari platform.cinema-city.ro, where to enroll the child in the competition and prepare it for voice proof.
Afterwards, one of the four films available on the platform must be selected, download the texts that the child is about to read and then the child will register by interpreting its own double version.
Four films about friendship, fairy heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the evidence: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: Guardian of the 3D Month", "Blinky Bill: Koala the 3D Posnasian" and "Albinuța Maya 3D".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double one character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - 3D Snow Cream", which will have the premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, tax forecasts expire for 2016
FedEx declared disappointing results for the last quarter, the bulk of deliveries reducing profit estimates for the year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's actions decreased by approximately 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it is expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, with less than 20 cents, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts recommended $10.84, according to a survey carried out by FactSet.
The decrease is due to an increase in prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January, and higher overtaxes for the land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply since November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase earnings compared to the previous year as a result of the reduction of costs, higher income and the development of online trade.
President and Director General Fred Smith stated that "the statement is faced with a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, in particular with regard to global production and trade."
The employment plans during the holiday period were announced one day after the UPS competitor stated that he intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of commitments he made last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The winnings per action were $2.42, under average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
The profit has risen by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the survey conducted by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the online shopping explosion jumped the results of FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the incomes of the ground division increased by 29%, but operational incomes stagnated practically due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher basic tariffs, while revenues from the Freight Division decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market transaction, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5% at $150.15.
Tuesday closing down by 11% at the year level and 17% compared to the maximum record recorded on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meetings in recent years, those responsible for the development of the Federal Reserve policies will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahon table to decide if the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank meeting room, a mural painting of the United States will be held.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above anything.
The Central Bank received a double charge from Congress: maximizing the employment rate in the United States and maintaining price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten burden: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be disavowed by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force since the end of 2008.
Although most data indicate a growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already careful to add volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even by a quarter of the percentage point.
"Evidence, labour market and inflation will be the first and most important aspects to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel & Co brokerage firm.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait longer," he said.
There is no consensus as to the decision that Fed will take, it itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently questioned by Bloomberg anticipated an increase in interest rate this week.
But the financial markets expect Fed to postpone, a key indicator showing that the growth probability is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall on the stock market if Fed increased interest rate, except where policy makers would reduce the impact by promising that it would spend a lot of time until the next growth.
Tuesday, industrial average Dow Jones climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The opinion was triggered by the expectations that Fed decision makers will maintain the stable interest rate this week, John Lonski said, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising if Fed were to raise interest rates at the moment,” Lonski said.
If Fed's decision-makers would do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets."
Other experts said an increase in interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty linked to the moment Fed was going to act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slowing the monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that it was expected to increase interest rate this year despite the objections raised by liberals such as the need for more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by Fed as total employment.
Salary gains have shown signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to achieve the annual target of the central bank, Fed decision makers said that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices falling sharply.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them given the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets have begun to enter fibrillations at the end of this month after China has devalued its currency.
Industrial media Dow Jones dropped by 16% under the peak record reached in May, as investors feared the slowdown of the Chinese economy will bring down global growth.
The market has somewhat recovered this month, the Dow index is now about 10% below the maximum of May.
For Fed decision factors, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the time of interest rate growth.
"Without what has happened on the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be stronger at the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was official Fed.
Now, he's forecasting they'll wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
"There is very much uncertainty as to what the impact will be on the US economy and that they have almost no data to base on subsequent China events," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed's major interests, so practically it should not be taken into account in making decisions.
But in reality, Fed became the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
The President's hint, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that Fed could "strengthened" his monetary expansion triggered a global earthquake.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly engaged, it is expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department of the Investnet welfare management firm Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has an over-sized reaction history of changes in the financial market that seem to be unrelated to economic bases."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body, which supported the increase in interest rate, provided as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis affecting Asia caused Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the implications of limited identification for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to those falls.
Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the case of a major crisis, such as the 2008 earthquake on the market, Adam S. Posen, was a member of the Bank of England interest rate-setting committee.
The last tense period did not rise to that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to get in the situation to be afraid of an increase in interest rate because the markets were upset," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this direction, I do not think that it should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite the attempts of the Nine channel to broadcast in Today Show about the change of party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of the changes from the leadership of the Liberal Party did not result in a significant increase in the audience for Today.
Nine's morning channel broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competitive Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts carried out over a few weeks, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Cascada and Cancun.
This distance “crossage” did not seem to count too much for Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today has seen a slight increase compared to the hearings of Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were smaller than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference from Sunrise in the past few months.
In August, today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, Parliament is not only affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main news was the amazing debut of the 800 Words series having as protagonist the former star of Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, with the subject of a widowed father who recently decided to move along with his two children on the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show alone without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The hearing results for last night responded resoundingly that "yes".
The X show The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000) were held in position with 1,136 million viewers.
Seven recorded ups and downs the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new moderate general culture show by Andrew O'Keefe had on average 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) rose to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613.000).
Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia show had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge number of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The decline of Chase Australia's second evening audience will give silent confidence to the Nine that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Because he opened up President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after the police fired rubber bullets in the protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the new proposed constitutions of the country on Wednesday an officer said.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in the district of Rupandehi, about 280 km west of the capital city of Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw rocks and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas after they fired fires before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to his statement, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not clear immediately why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The collision was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said that the new provinces established on the basis of the new constitution would distort their political influence.
Protests also existed in the west of Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in the violent strikes triggered on August 10,
when four major political parties signed an agreement for the division of the country in the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, centrally governed country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but the lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new card could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues to exchange replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the meeting of the Government on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm position against the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania disagrees and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or gun cops.
"It's a shame for 21st-century Europe to apply 30th-year methods," Victor Ponta said.
"The first said all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the Prime Minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide front of low pressure at about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde Islands presents a 60% probability of transforming into a tropical cyclone within 48 hours, said the National Center for Hurricanes in the United States on Tuesday.
Another well-defined front of low pressure about half the distance between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of formation of a tropical cyclone over the next two days, added the weatherologist in Miami.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether mild-obesit diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those who pursue neurgic treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, called bariatric surgery, use different methods to narrow the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a weight measurement unit relative to height, is considered normal within the range 18,5-24,9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used close data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - bypass gastric and gastrectomy in manson - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes to people with mild obesity.
Mean BMI in patients who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received neurgic treatments against diabetes remained at almost the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured at only 1% and partly at only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of blood glucose over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of haemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
Following surgery, the average haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9% to about 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
However, this improved glycaemic control - reflected by improved haemoglobin levels A1c - has not reduced mortality to five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the gastrectomy group in manson, the bypass surgical intervention group lost more weight (18.7 than 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% compared to 2.1%) and presented a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% compared to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study performed on people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese individuals who underwent bariatric surgery presented a probability of approximately 29% less to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit to patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the point where this work is critical because it says that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” she says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we wait too long until we urge people to take this aspect seriously,” she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that shorten their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent a call to put an end to the violence in the refugee mother countries.
Dalai Lama talked about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that, in the present situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of each nation and even each continent.
He also pointed out that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It’s wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, in Muslim countries,” he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce the crime in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attacks on 11 September, claiming that the U.S. violent response generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of September 11, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Anti-Water Centre in Georgia, U.S. anti-Water centres reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in terms of the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed hands with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Anti-Water Centre in Georgia, the cases of ingestion of the hand detergent in children under 12 years of age reported at the anti-Water Centres rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more access to these products and, unfortunately, one percent of them reach the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some kids are intentionally drinking detergent and others are doing it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube you can watch movies showing teenagers how to drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that adolescents mixed the detergent with mouth water with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the detergent.
“A child doesn’t think it hurts them,” says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are perfumed.
Hand detergents with strawberry flavour, grape, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-toxicity center at Kansas University Hospital, for Fox channel 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hands detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four sprays with strawberry flavouring hands, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol 179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was balming and couldn't go when he arrived at the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate baby hospital to identify the signs of brain damage, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, for CNN.
He could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free wet products or napkins and no longer let the hands cleaner at the children's disposal.
In addition to poisoning with alcohol, some detergents were associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hands that contained an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students in northern New York planned to poison their professor "bad" by "putting antibacterial products in class", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and has forbidden him in his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be “not meant” and raised the disciplinary issue of the school inspectorate.
Rumour Mill: There are no misunderstandings at Celtic
Griffiths exposes rumors about Celtic's misconceptions, admitting that Hoops are not at the best moment but will return.
Hearts with the SFA on Neilson and Warburton charges are cautious about the acquisitions in January that affected the team's unit
Dons increase the difference from Celtic to five points
The criminalization of ADAM Rooney in the first round brought to the Aberdeen a narrow victory in front of the Hamilton to Pittodrie, Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths removes rumors related to misunderstanding
There have been rumors about misunderstanding in Celtic, demonized by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure as they prepare to confront the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think players just wait.
Absence of Scots in the title race bore the Dutch - by Boer
Former middle of Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters have lost interest in Celtic - because they don't fight for the title with Rangers.
By Boer, now the ambassador of Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands he no longer transmits the summary of the Celtic matches; why?”
Because it's not Rangers there.
Here, it's not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams and that's where the interest is headed.
The tension is high in the games in Old Firm and not just the Scots want to see these games.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic was fighting out of power but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat of Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen that played in 10 people, now in the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had periods before and will return."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to go on.
We're definitely in need of the support of Celtic because so players get better.
It's extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton's judgment on January's transfers
Despite comments from just a few weeks ago that suggested that a few goals for the January transfers would be identified, the chief of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the unit of the Hebox team.
The former head of Brentford said: "The period of transfers in January is very different from the one in the summer."
In case of players transferred by summer, there is a period before the season when they can be integrated, which you could observe this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring unnecessary players.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
The Swansea Striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw upon the expiration of the agreement with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts with SFA regarding Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Paterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red card of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: “We have not questioned integrity, we have not commented on performance.”
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken to the point after he admitted that he sang a song with offensive lyrics about the former player at Hearts, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
“It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment,” the striker added, adding: “I no longer need to say that I don’t go back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic.”
Tannadice Council Trusts in Dundee United Management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that those in the Dundee United still have confidence that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "poor victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the team in Aberdeen must cling desperately to Hamilton Accies to get the seventh successive win in the league, which has brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the punishment shots of the first shot by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: “There is no team to win anything, in the cup or league, and not to win games like this.”
The rate of unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain grows
RATA THE BOY in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 during the period May, while the number of unemployed in Britain totaled by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million at the same time.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that of the United Kingdom of 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the National Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over three months, with the number of employees currently being 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% respectively - an average of 73.5 in the UK.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term government plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It's been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate of employment registering growth and the unemployment rate decrease.
Why am I a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I'll look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a room for observers from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary's execution room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I am terrified of the idea.
So, why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because usually requests exceed the number of places available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'd sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed my own connection with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to note what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I cried at her.
He acknowledged that “it could have formulated better,” but he still believes that they are wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if I asked.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime.
However, they wish to have an international report on the subject.
He thinks that if he dies, publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, Huffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series I made.
I'm not coming back here on every detail.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees make him guilty of complicit.
But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I certainly don't think there's been enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
You'll find out from me what it's like to look at a man who likes dying useless.
Peter Moody claims that the Stewarts tried to spy on him and threatened to retreat from the races
Peter Moody said the Stewarts Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy into his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the races.
He launched an attack on the stars and on the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are carrying out a personal campaign against him, a drop that filled the glass with the removal of Lady Dadi from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the field of racing and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about statements about spies and did not want to resemble "the fox that does not reach the grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that aspect and I've been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all burst suddenly," Moody said.
It's known it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to endure the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I'm working with to see that I'm trying to offer them everything that's best.
From the moment they start to believe that it doesn't happen that way, I have to give up the training job.
At that moment I'll have to think about what I'll do with my certification.
Previously, Moody threw the bomb in an interview for racing.com that said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
“After eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man whose name I’m going to tell him if I’m asked – and they offered to hire him to my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody told Racing.com.
Of course he thinks I'm a cheat.
If so, then you should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Sandry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can it hold people out of trains accountable for what's going on in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and get away with it and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might lead them to think about this option.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on them and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration increased with the long-term investigation of cobalt testing in which Lidari was involved and the elimination led him to say that he could “put his license on the table”.
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the undefeated Black Caviar champion, labeled the treatment rule of the day of the race as "ridicile" after applying on the legs a cataplasm with nemol or clay, which violates the rules.
It's breaking the rules of the races.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees mistakenly put his foot in trouble.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of the day of the race consisting of the application of the cataplasm, for which the Stewarts opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand the need for rules, but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by an escape from the crash site.
The biker was transported with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being badly injured after being hit Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley motorway.
Police representatives say the driver of the car didn't stop to help the wounded biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man handed himself over to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of running from the scene of the accident, of disposing of the first aid and other road offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital, stable.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to the charges of wrestling.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms of plaque tactics used by his team as "denatured subjects" brought into discussion by the main two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the arbitrators allowed Storm players to “take them off the hook” team in the game won by Storm in the final qualification played on Friday night in Sydney.
The coach of Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match, played Saturday night, when he called that match a "demonstrate" of rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland are not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the plaque tactics addressed by his team and said that the players simply focused on "contact" when they did.
Bellamy says she got confidence after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us up with score 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything every year in our defensive systems or techniques, so that in the last six weeks we've really put the emphasis on contact in pleasure and so we've changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so it's probably not used to losing and was a shock to him.
We know how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "the soul of football", reminding his mentor St. George-Illawarrra Dragons won Bennett's 2010 championship by playing "plitious" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and talking about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he doesn't care as black as under his fingernails.
But now it has a team that can play what we consider to be palpitating football, especially because of the middle young rapped.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his game style - not any team has two middles like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like this.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us thinking about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was a tougher score match compared to the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos game was probably a good match, haven't I seen him yet, how long was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game were two more trials, which means exciting game?
Or does it mean to pause and not march?
It's plans for me.
If I talk about us, it means at some point we could meet.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home either with North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks, in the final of the Saturdays at AAMI Park, placing the tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was sleeping then authenticated in an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as a subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
She looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages after she immediately alerted her mother.
After the arrival, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at that address and found “worry” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "draw the pedophiles" on the Internet before he "proclaimed he was a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee court: “It’s said it’s an addiction - it’s dependent to scare people.
He admitted he did search on the computer but said he did it because he wanted to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who had sent his pictures and that he had asked that person to send some more photos.
He said he did it to challenge.
He said that he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and wants to see images with rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found her messages on the phone, she shouted and shook and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, the 23-year-old Hogg, who lived in Ward Road, Dundee, blamed the charges he had made or had taken indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of release on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March of the current year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the sexual offender register because it can be said that this offence “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was passed on to the sex offender register before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, conveyed the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, the filming of the fall has not been hurt. It has become viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by representatives of the opposition who claimed that they would have received anonymous threats of death, threatening them that they would not somehow rule out Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they dismissed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The leader of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number, but it is entitled “death,” he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
It warns Members concerned that immunity applies only to Parliament and once Parliament is left, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
The leader of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availabilitys
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 supplies as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year. HP will divide the stock exchange into two companies, separating the division of computers and printers from operations with corporate hardware and services growing lightning.
The anticipated availability will cost approximately $2.7 billion from quarter four, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring to the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure with regard to costs," said Meg Whitman, the president and director general HP, who will lead the unit after the break.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently and will hold a wide portfolio of businesses that will contribute to the transition of firms to the new business run style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate society, we are better placed than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to one company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over $50 billion and will "focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by the graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, which is the subject of the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the Silicon Valley.
HP has passed through massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest companies in the field of technology in the United States, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus best on one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the peak of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of deaths in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign against Poor Life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship lies at the centre of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy condition”, his chances of recovery are doubled.
At the same time, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces to half the probability of the occurrence of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to have effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not on substance, the immediate nature of the response has often priority before the contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong, open to fun and success personality, even though in reality isolation is the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which also affect our mental health.
The inventor of a video game recently explained that money does not really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interaction as friends.
The humor of Joey's and Chandler's frequent huggings, the moments when they look at football in the comfortable folleries and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that men can be associated with this situation, even though they often fail to fully explore their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: "My role in listening to people with a suicidal and depressed tendency has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference."
Often, people who call us don't feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying to deal with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
The series has highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective, external intervention, through the phone, people enough in times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you attend this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete editing of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG take Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut match in the League of Champions and helped PSG to set himself in front of the Swedish Malmo team.
Next we present you the game chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani made their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the game series in the League of Champions groups, with a quiet 2-0 win against Malmo in the game played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing French champions to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in the minute 61.
Reaching the Group A with Real Madrid and Shahtior Donetzk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the aim of the French team is not only the qualification in the best but also an improvement of the journey towards the quarter of the final in each of the last three tournaments.
But even though they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity of emptying after being replaced by the team in his hometown and the club to which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or on the way to the Champions League, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference against the next class, even though there are still issues that need to be perfected throughout the season,” says Blanc.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I'm sorry we couldn't get one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident at one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 cast from Bordeaux home in League 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took the light of the reflectors in minute four.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentinian middle offensive was called the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he slammed at Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before he shook incredibly over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if someone expected the PSG to win by punching their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders on national teams, with a defense of five men and two half-defensives, was a powerful opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making the whistle of Nikola Djurdjic who passed from Kevin Trapp's post in minute 34.
Instead, PSG players slowed down the pace a few times, giving a few unnecessary and non-finalizing interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five tests in the first round and was then replaced by Caves right after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much more successful in supporting his colleagues, paying attention to him being the one Di Maria sent in a diverted from Wiland over the gate in minute 52.
The second goal was recorded in the final after an hour of the game, due to Cavani, the Uruguayan who wrote the sixth empty in the season after Ibrahimovic passed from the center of Maxwell.
This goal has eliminated the hope of Malmo that they will rebalance the score and just a superb stop to Wiland from afar for David Luiz's rejection has maintained the final score before the new Ezequiel Lavezzi entrance cancels an extension goal.
Norwegian coach from Malmo, Age Hareide, later said that PSG was in a class over and that "The last game I played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I've only played in Sweden's league, which doesn't rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Down the hat for the PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by a fall in stock prices on the stock exchange, raised $2.5 billion in the sale of shares as part of a large debt reduction plan.
Glencore Company, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said it sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is in transit with prices falling off the stock exchange because China's decline in economic activity influences demand and causes disaster in markets.
The preferential subscription right increased the price of Glencore shares on London stock exchange in transactions on Wednesday morning.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion as part of larger plans to cover almost a third of his debt of $30 billion.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, with 2.4% less than the closing price of Tuesday.
He took out of the company 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the growth of the prolonged stagnant Chinese economy led to a substantial rise in prices in iron ore by approximately half, and coal, copper and other goods fell by 20-40%.
Xi insists on the wider expansion of the global economy
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reformed group that the economy must open wider to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must undertake to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," Xi said, in the 16th meeting of the Central Conduct Group for the Continuation of General Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting the openness and encouragement of reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and will take place economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of state enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through testing programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a business environment based on legislation and providing a wider opening up of the market.
The state authorities will also weaken checks on the powers that companies delegate, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their business.
According to the statement, China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In an attempt to open the State controlled sectors, several sectors will be opened to private investment.
“State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment companies and will provide them with better services,” the statement stated.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimising the requirements and smoothing the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the right of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli participated at the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, dissatisfied with the Government's proposal to increase wages by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the unions in Education have not come to any end, the government proposing a 10% increase in wages, from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase in November, or a 20% increase in December.
The discussions took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
Today's government's proposal has not satisfied us, otherwise we would not have come to the situation to convene the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent that promised us today is less for us than we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have entered into in our agreement with the Government last year, for 2016," said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
Ponta: In the future health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be an FSLI meeting which will also be attended by the representatives of the Government to present representatives of the confederates of the country's proposal for wage growth, following that the unions decide whether to accept the Executive's offer.
The Prime Minister also told the unionists that the Government is trying to send the Wage to Parliament as quickly as possible so that it could enter into force on 1 December.
The statutory act provides for an increase in wages in the education system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase in the document expected to be exhaled within the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the unionists the full payment of all the judgments in 2016.
Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned, Tuesday, in Turkish territorial waters, after the ship was shipwrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, AFP reports, according to Yahoo News.
The boat is located in the Aegean Sea and is headed to the Greek island Kos.
Turkey's coast guard transmitted that it was able to save 249 people who were in the wrecked boat, but they still don't know their nationality.
Previously, Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also on the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakoni, located 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat transports more people than its capacity, so it has wrecked.
Route has become a popular lately for immigrants who want to escape war and heavy life from countries like Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 Stewardese, fired because they were too fat
Air India fires about 130 stewars and Stewards because they are superweights, it announced the company at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was taken for reasons of security and recent government regulations, but critics say the measure is "rediculate" and "sort of sexist", says The Washington Post.
Delivery in the table is the most recent of a ten-year battle between the company and the most crowded stewardess.
Weight limit for these dates from the '80s, when Air India began using graphics with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the new Stewardese considered "extraordinary", which said "can have an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility needed to carry out emergency measures".
The Stewardeses brought the company to justice, won and were re-employed, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them weaken have failed," explains a spokesman for the company.

If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy in which he invested a considerable amount, Paul Papp's foundation opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will function in the city of Dej, village villages waiting for an initial selection action.
I'm extremely happy that I've reached this stage, to give the start of the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without worrying about training material.
They must have one care: to play football the better.
Technical details must not be their concern.
They have to value their talent.
This is what they want to do 'Paul Papp' Football Academy.
"I'm also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the children's first selection, to show them he's with them," Papp said for the dejean.ro.
At Star Foundation Academy are expected children up to 11 years old.
The whole party wants government.
The interim president of PSD Live Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government and, if the prime minister wishes, the PSD Congress will formalise this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants the government, the whole party.
If we want to formalize through a Congress decision, we will also do this.
There won't be any emotion about that.
"There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that gave someone insecure to the government or that gave someone the impression that someone from the party does not want PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current Prime Minister," Dragnea said at the end of the session of the Permanent National PSD.
PSD announced when it will do congresses - what will decide then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, give a clear message if the government wants to continue or if the party decides to pass the opposition.
Dragea: I'll announce Monday if I'll run for a function at Congress
On the other hand, Dragnea's Book will announce next Monday if it'll run for a leadership function at the future Congress.
I will sing, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if it determines the date of the congress.
"I'll let you know if I'll run for a function in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of the March session of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation regarding the announcement of the application has anything to do with the file, Dragnea said it doesn't have this problem.
I don't have the problem you're going to refer to, but it seems fair and honest to all of my colleagues in the party to notify me or not an application when it formally establishes the date of Congress.
"It's the only reason," Dragnea said.
The great majority of the Social-Democratic subsidiaries proposed extraordinary PSD Congress on 11 October and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the Party's Executive Committee.

On this occasion, border police discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the motorway, among plastic slabs, two men.
As a result of the checks, two men, aged 28 years, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
"At research, young people said that they intended to reach France, which was why they connected with a conational, through which they met the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they would receive 2,000 euros of the person," the Communication of the Border Police shows.
The two migrants were committed to "criminal work in the face of the invasion of the offence of attempting to fraudulent crossing of the state border".

Simona Halep was faced with a crucial decision for her career, being she had to choose whether or not she would continue to cooperate with Coach Darren Cahill.
The two of them worked this year in the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being with only the important tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise at Cahill's address, which seemed to be the only coach who managed to impose himself in front of the sports capricious.
The Adidas program will end at the end of this year, and Halep has to decide whether to offer a consistent contract to Cahill or to give up collaboration.

It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca devalued how he broke up with Romania's national team last fall.
The former selectioner testified that he did not understand President FRF, Razvan Burleanu, after this took his place at Mircea Sandu, and thus took the decision to leave the national.
Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to raise his salary to stay, but he was refused.
Right now I'm not sorry I left the national.
Then I felt sorry, leaving a job behind.
That's how I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happens to me when I was a selectioner, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions from the press about me.
He didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and probably changed it too.
But I wanted to go.
If he wanted to stay, then I proposed a deal.
We have about 400 and some thousands of euros a year, and then we have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we ended up in the group first," said Victor Piturca at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania's National in the fall last year, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 previews.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.

Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't drink alcohol, he was visible as being drunk.
When he first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe drinking alone, he's an alcoholic in secret'," he tells, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's footage with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't recognize himself: "I looked into my eyes and I wasn't there."
'That was awful, I didn't remember anything'.
Besides, his wife, who, although doubted for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled alcohol.
The moment that put Nick's thoughts on him was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, he found out he had a alcohol problem three times over the legal language, although one night before he had not consumed a single beer.
After years and investigations without number, it was found that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".

Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf course
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, as a protest against the services he had on the dealer's side.
The man attacked his car with a golf course, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, broadcasts BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video came over the Internet, for the fun of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has faults that endanger his life and his family.
His anger came when the dealer he bought the car didn't solve his problem, just as he agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, "National immigration strategy for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "a stage that Romania is still going through in its efforts to modernise the immigration management process on the national territory", according to a press release.
The source mentioned shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect the policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the countries of the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures were taken to manage unitary and coherent situations resulting from the possible influx of illegal immigrants into the territory of Romania, generated by the political, social, economic or military crisis.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will give special attention to citizens from countries with potential migration or that may affect national security," added the source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out a few general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, stricter controls of the legality of the seat of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal masses and restrictive masses, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the implementation and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to Romania's territory of third-party citizens who respond to the demands for the occupation of the labour force, promoting the access of third-country nationals to Romanian higher education institutions for areas and professions identified as deficit.
With reference to the Action Plan in 2015, the Government appreciates that it represents "a means by which concrete activities are established to lead to the creation of a flexible system for halting the growing migration phenomenon."

In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly cost of the labor force.
Activity report of TVR, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks resignation
Parliament's Committees of Culture rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Council of Administration of the Roman Society of Television in 2014.
In order to reject the report, 17 parliamentarians voted, one against the rejection ( Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the permanent bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary meeting will be debated.
"I believe that considering this situation will be done relatively quickly," said the president of the Senate Culture Commission, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was a good feeling" that TVR's management should be present at this meeting, under the conditions that no representative of the TVR's management was present at the Committees' meeting.
It was good to be present TVR because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members just last night, with an approximate hour that we didn't know about the time, but today, after the Bureau meeting, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I believe that when you're called, you're paid by the public taxes, and you're summoned to a meeting of the committees you meet even if you don't like living.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution in Parliament's subordination," Severin said after the committee meeting of Parliament's culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees.
The debts we also saw as they went on, came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they didn't pay for the historical ones.
"I remind you that not because of me or anyone else in these committees has lost that pleasure with banks and the bill, there are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the meeting plenary, there will be elections for a new Board of Directors, and he will elect the director general of the institution.
I don't know who's going to be proposed for this function.
Wonders won't be done.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man I'm lying to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand at the tail here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary, by their vote will choose people who will drive TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of correctness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what quality you need to have -- well, I feel in the attitude of the employees because it's a bunch of little boys coming from employees, commercials, layoffs.
"When you receive such referrals 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster," the president of the Senate Culture Commission concluded.
Although the president-general of TVR, Stelian Tanase, did not appear in Parliament, he sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that Parliament should have regard to a number of measures that could lead to the saving and securing of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexing of TV tax.
In letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to indexing the TV tax, to amend and supplement HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public television service, for the purpose of updating the provisions at the level of technological change on the day, as well as for the regulation of the procedure on the control of TV tax and the finding of infringements and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision that provides for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become representatives of the SRTv for the collection of the TV tax by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission of cashiers.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to 3%, but also changes to the law 41/1994, in order to receive budgetary/financial allocations for the acquisition of licents for major cultural and sport events - the World Football Championship, the Golden Cerbul, Eurovision.
He contends that SRTv will be unable to pay in the following months considering that the law of work obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not definitive, and wages rights are accorded priority to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce costs with staff and TV production.
"So travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a series of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed", the letter of the president of TVR showed.
So much appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be corrected only by its own efforts.
"Without the support of the institutions of the State - Government, Parliament, Presidency - The Romanian Television will be, sooner or later, unable to carry out the public mission" is mentioned in the letter.
The House of Deputies has decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.

He set up the security company Axis Corporate Security SRL, with his mother in April 2009, one year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation found that, for the purpose of subtracting taxes and taxes from the state budget, the representatives of a security service company would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which the fictitious transactions would have been evident.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have been recorded in the fictitious procurement of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros," Roman Police explained in a press release.
The Seics have established the fate of Sanmartean
The site of the Al-Ittihad club has established the fate of the middle of Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that the departure of Sanmartean by Ittihad is imminent, the entrepreneur of the coach Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will no longer happen.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays game holder and does it well.
The Seici also realized that he is the best and that he would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been his choice to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been more discussions, such as the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been realized," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice-President at the Court of Auditors
The plenary voted on Wednesday the appointment of PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 "for" and 108 "impotriva" votes were recorded.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The representatives of the PNL were the only ones who voted against this proposal, informs Digi24.
On the other hand, the liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment in this capacity and announced that they would challenge it to the CCR, in conditions where he has a file on DNA, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign her from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow her to make any more policy.
The PSD will serve as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, which remains free after Ioan Anton was revoked as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was called non-constitutional.
Surprise from one of the hottest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
How Bradley Cooper is going to play the role of a chef in the "Burnt" movie, the actor made a breakthrough that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: "I've worked a lot of my life as a cook."
He devalued that he had been working in the kitchen for 15 years, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, because then, in college, he went on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the whole childhood cooked with Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man who would make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things that you laugh about if I told you," he said, but he said that what he wanted from childhood was accomplished.
Up to the age of 40, the actor acknowledged that he saw himself in the near future directing, taking on the model of Clint Eastwood, who took a turn at this age.
Bridge, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational assertions
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned the statements of the Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Wednesday morning according to all the political decisions in Hungary are "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, by his irrational assertions, he insults the entire Hungarian minister," he sent the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs in a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: his total support for Romania's internal policy has been lost," added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to attract attention and punish the behavior of high government officials in Hungarians, who, in his opinion, "are a shame for the culture and values of the European Union".
I don't want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" said Ponta on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that he is the host of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Sarma chimpathizes, aggressive laws, imprisonments and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, are policy makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - which we see in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!" the head of the Roman executive stressed.
Previously on Tuesday, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, qualified as "simple lies" the remarks of the Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta regarding the management of the refugee crisis by Hungary, appreciating that these claims are inappropriate for a leader of the 21st century, according to MTI.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extremeist and liaric remarks" of the Romanian Prime Minister on the internal political crisis in Romania and stated that Budapest is waiting for excuses from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing borders, like all those who are coming are terrorists, they're bullshit from the Middle Ages and I'm totally opposed to this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get it, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people like some people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat it, with bricks and insert.
"That's what I disagree with," said the head of the Roman executive at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest has decided to begin preparations in the field for extending to the Romanian border of the fence that it builds at the border with Serbia, to face a possible change of the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that Hungary's decision to raise a border fence solves nothing of the refugee problem and "is not Hungary in Europe".
What's the connection between Osama bin Laden and the macal collapse of Mecca?
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible for the collapse of a crane, Friday, on the Mecca's Great Moschee, an accident following 107 people died.
According to an investigation committee, the company did not "respect the safety rules", reported the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), reports BBC.
The company's directors have been prohibited from leaving the country until the investigation is completed in this case.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by the brother of the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years at the expansion of the Mosque Sea, in order to host more pilgrims.
The accident took place Friday night, during a storm, when a macara, probably unbalanced by the powerful gusts of wind, collapsed on the east side of the covered of the Great Mosque in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and almost 400 were injured.
How Hagi closed the contestants' mouth
Considered by many of the world's largest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled after his withdrawal from work, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform performance and in the new position.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Staraua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he owns.
After a year after taking the team, the King demonstrated that he was able to transform a team that was struggling to rescue from retrograde into a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future registered, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 remixes and 11 offenders.
The balance sheet is one of the top teams, which fights at European cups.
Things took a better and better turn for the Future this season, as the team arrived in the second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double than the Star.
On the other hand, even if he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start team came up names like Janis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has made in the future a team to track the teams from abroad, so Hagi sold this summer of 1.5 million euros - Janis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Baris - 500 thousand euros).
In addition to the Star, the Future is the only profit team in League 1, according to the data from the Register of Commerce.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the governing college of the Roman Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea has shown that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and the very police means will not work in this crisis: "We may doubt the quality of the values these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality that we need to adapt to as much and adapt to them as we do.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we are at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area need to be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted for the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the predictions said they had the necessary votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the unanimity principle applies in the JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves it by vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, the reaction of rejection even in Germany against the policy of opening up the Chancellor Merkel and did not want in many countries to appear as a reaction of the "EU sending us migrants to the head".
So they have, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably assist in major changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory odds weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just let go of it?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk about a greater involvement of Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members on the external Schengen border to the responsibility of Community agents.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Maybe he'll give up on the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are responsible for the state where he first enters, because he's not sustainable.
If Greece capitulates, you can't tell infinitely that it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve a solution without a precise, perhaps binding mechanism, of imparting the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they get to them.
Because there's a problem: what are you doing with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European States will take over migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It is likely that there will be single filtration centres in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are strong without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophob current.
It is true that we speak of millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in a precarious camp and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
One estimate says only 10% have gotten away, winter is hard to go by the Mediterranean, but we expect next year to a wave may even be bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will not look at it so badly in the media.
You're talking hard with less or more experience.
Do you think there is a place where the integration of large groups from an extra-European culture has really been possible?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean it doesn't integrate at all.
There is still an innocent part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in the UK.
But the police just won't work.
To create the fortress of Europe is illusory.
It needs to be addressed to integration mechanisms in European societies.
Here were some mistakes.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let's ask these people to learn their language, try to take their values, not to stay one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family including by their convenience spouses.
It is necessary to separate the imminent problem of these people from their integration in the long term.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it doesn't mean we have to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of these people coming with.
And if it's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean it's gonna make the country over the night and you can take them back.
Until the solutions come out, we see forts within Europe.
Boundaries are closed, walls rise, checks are reintroduced to the border into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and fixing the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where they first set foot on these migrants.
I mean, we're free to go around, but everyone's in trouble.
In front of such a wave it can't be so, because some countries don't make a face.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run it doesn't change much.
After the French attacks, we do not have much more effective anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of military statements from home politicians under the pressure of being virile.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for humans but also for goods.
This is the only European real market.
And I don't think the Europeans will abandon this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules, it's different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation right now.
How did Romania play so far in this crisis?
Like a little country, who thinks that if he pulls the axe over his eyes and blinds his ears, the theme disappears.
In front of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
Like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will decline greatly.
President Iohannis says it's probably good that we haven't already come in.
So we move from despair of entering to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria join the Schengen area that migrants see us as an alternative route.
What doesn't mean it's a reason we don't get into Schengen anymore, but we're more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen and Schengen will exist, but transformed into common responsibility for external borders, there will be single rules for acceptance of migrants, single rules for deportation for non- asylum seekers, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved his attention to Syria in Ukraine no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, Russia's game?
Russia has frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being great power means confusing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed a long time ago.
And it was good to collapse before the principal or opponent was the Islamic State.
About two years was a struggle between Assad and the secular and moderate Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to land.
Russia was able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
It creates a fire of instability and chaos that it can't close.
But you're powerful only if you have solutions.
The game off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Maybe Putin's waiting to get bids, to press buttons to fix the situation.
The offerings don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can solve things in one way or another created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that say these people are led by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will soon appear
Millions of Facebook users have become used to the "Like" button, and now representatives of the social network prepare another opposite one, the "Dislike".
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on the account or that this button will soon be available, inform New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg specified that the "Dislike" button will show a nuance of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid the moments when someone posted on the account or an important event in life, and someone else would give "Dislike".
Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long called for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving like that post," Facebook representative pointed out.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hatred on Facebook and social networks," said Atiq Haneef in Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article was posted with this subject.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, claimed there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a media social analyst at the eMarketer company, said it's hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports, the election campaign is approaching America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands of mass arrivals at its southern border with Serbia, announced Government Councillor Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main crossing point of the border and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The move drew a sudden reaction from Serbia.
They said yesterday they would seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a record of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also registered in Hungary in Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being recorded and try to get to the West, especially in Germany.
The new seat of the Judicial Council stands to fall.
Two builders in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, seem to give up because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The seat of the Judiciary Council on Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up giving up on its own.
One and a half years after the building had been completed, the work had not reached half.
One last stage in the building’s epic was consumed last day, when the National Council for the Settlement of Disputes (NCSC) rejected a complaint from the firm that wanted to take over the contract for the completion of the technical project for the work that is still to be carried out.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the manufacturer and the termination of the works, the negotiation procedures were initiated without the publication of an Impex Romcatel participation announcement, and the firm was to update the technical project and then hold a new works auction.
"The negotiations were not concluded by a contract, however, and the CJ appreciated that the proposed form would be disadvantaged the institution," Răzvan Timofciuc concluded, represented public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to discontinue direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing court sent the complaint to CNSC, which rejected it as late.
But this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision in the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of the Court can be taken into consideration finding another designer.
Thus, building building consolidation could be resumed as soon as possible next year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We're waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work on strengthening the former police headquarters started in 2011.
A first contract of works was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei.
The auction was resumed, the contract being adjudicated by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The work has been done so far in proportion to approximately 50%.
Initially, the building's consolidation, recasting and softening had been assessed at 7.7 million lei.
"Okay, I'm telling you everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former chief at Cadastru
One of the employees involved in the scandalous record of the Cadastru Office signed a reconnaissance agreement against postponement.
Most likely his statements will incriminate the other accused, in the head of the former chief Narciza Nedelcu
A counsellor from the Office of Cadastru y Advertising Imobiliare (OCPI) and accused of DNA in a file of corruption recognized his telefap.
The Agreement on Recognition of Facts signed by Dumitru Dălu was registered yesterday at the Iaşi Court, the judges setting out a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dăcălu was accused of false intellectuals in continuous form and agreed to perform two years in stalls with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to the facts attributed to Ducălu, the prosecutors stated that he, as the adviser to the Office of Cadastru, together with other colleagues, "made in false many verbatim acceptance processes, sold the contracts of pre-keyed service loans by O.C.P.I. and with the administrators of SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Ca Dastru Agency and Topographies SRL and PFA Lipșa Stefan, which testified, in an unrealistic manner, that the services contracted were fully carried out, under conditions where they were not performed and were not filed at O.C.P.I.I. Iasi".
Last days, the former chief of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but other former or current CPPO employees were sued in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to the above-mentioned firms, although the works were not carried out.
Pre-trial is more than 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of president FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of female handball for qualification at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the League of Champions.
As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main objective is the qualification at the Rio Olympic Games, but for that, it has to go from two stages of the Caudes, firstly the World Championship and secondly the prequalification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight persons.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masons, gate coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualifications of some things, exactly material for physical preparation, which we've never heard of.
That's all to get to the Olympics. And I'll do everything it takes to get them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot of money.
But this is the way to do performance.
Because at the moment we're in the Stone Age with the preparation.
"The teams we beat have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who said that he was trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The president of the FRH also referred to Romania's infrastructure and to the possibility that our country will host a major handball competition.
We don't have room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is ashamed to be questioned by a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in other parts of the world Olympics have been built entirely within two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area in Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a highlight of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics organization was a success and from the point of view of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," said Dedu.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me, it's a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but it was very quick that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, we told them we wanted, we were able to organize, and they said they agreed and invited them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discussed concrete.
"So we have all the opening, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure," the FRH officer explained.
The former great handbalist avoided evaluating the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to arrive at Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in predictions, that if they fail to meet them back against them."
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbiists debut on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said, on Tuesday, in a press conference, that all members of the Romanian Lotto are prepared for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to obtain two winners: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at maximum speed.
We trained to give the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are hard and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But surely, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participation in the World Cup, it's the gathering of so many years of work.
I wish I wouldn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, are proud to represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania's national team selectr Lynn Howells, first experienced coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of Rubby's selection: "It's a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it's very important that every game I make the Romanians be proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Federation of Rugby, Haralambie Dumitras, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in rugby in recent years.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I believe we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams for 18-19 years, so there's cohesion, it's a band of friends who set themselves up to realize a dream," Dumitras said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve in Group D, with the following scheduled matches: France, 23 September in London; Ireland, 27 September in London; Canada, 6 October in Leicester; Italy, 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, on the Twickenham stadium in London, with the match England - Fiji in group A.

14 million lei give to the "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital in Iași at budget correction
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The "Sf. Spiridon" hospital received approximately 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health following budgetary correction.
The money that the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in work to modernise and fix clinics, but also in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six sets used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds with appropriate ophthalmogenic microscopes, and other necessary medical equipment.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received from the hospital will be directed to construction works and accommodation of the "Marelu Ars".
Out of the money from the budget correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will receive the works from the gateway linking UPU of cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transport of the UPU sick in nearby clinics," the medical unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tataraşi, which will organize in the ambulatory, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will function in the area where allergology, haematology and endocrinology are located in the ambulatory and will have about 30 beds.
Take off, laughed at by RATP controllers and a folder.
The marketing of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iaş to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to tread again in your city.
Without wishing, they hit the misinformation from the folders, the misnomer of RAPT controllers and, bonus, a "so-called law" fine.
The wives arrived in Iashi a few days ago, stayed at a hotel in the Centre and asked for tours.
They also got a folder in which the RATP tracks were past.
"Armarmed" with these maps, the wives visited Iashul.
But two days ago, you found out in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because she wasn't in tickets at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the folder: that I can take the ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Folding trusts, they got on a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the folder.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said that there was no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
Where do I know what was written in the local press, I'm coming a night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's not their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is give us one fine instead of two (me and the wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day visiting the booth at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!" Ovidiu tells.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of the misinformation on the folder and the controllers who "implyed the law to the blood".
It's not fair, and I made a session at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not too much, but the idea is that I felt wrong.
Prejudice for rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in custody
The trial of the seven rapists at Vaslui moved yesterday to the Court of Appeal Iași.
Jewish magistrates have tried the first term of trial at a non-public meeting in which the seven youths accused of having insulted an 18-year-old girl have asked to be released.
Prior to the actual start of the trial meeting, one of the foreign judges who had been assigned to the file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The magistrate activated until this summer at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Pe nale Section, who, on 9 April, admitted a challenge by four of the defendants, having their place in custody.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete of which the Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu judges are.
Previously, in the file he made a abstention and Judge Dan An ton, because his daughter was in a relationship of cohabitation with one of the rapist lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vaslui's rapists would remain in pre-trial arrest.
Your blacks will remain incarcerated for at least 30 days, when the Jews will redeem the possibility of their release.
The next deadline will be held at the Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Iași, the van with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident caused in the area of Paccurari, the car entering the Iaşi on the belt.
Iveco's autoutility with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks wagen car that came out of the Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van circulates from the end of Paccurari.
The car entered Iasi around here because the employees of the Prisoners' Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi on Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They have thus shortened the road a few kilometers.
Immediately after impact, the arrest escort called for another transport, to take over prisoners.
In a short time, a car was sent to the site of the accident from the Iaş Maximum Security Penitentiary, which took over the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
Following the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer it to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the noodles, and the arrests came out in speed, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the vehicle were amiably understood as regards the damage to be paid," said Chief Medălin Tăranu Commissioner of the IPJ.
Large migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and clear: neither 7000 refugees should and should naturalize Romania are, in itself, a non-significant number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, about 1500 souls, is far beyond the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinaryly small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasit of interlopi and paralysed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The power to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any colour were unable to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent medical assistance, collect street dirt, create honorable jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country they run from?
But what causes a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first hit by the belligerent prowess of strong EU states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of the Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably afraid to steal someone's national being.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, accept no other destination of exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be missed.
The causes must be eliminated, some support and, by strictly moving on the book of political justice, ask for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosed, disassembled and out-of-place construction.
I was complaining that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but that neither the EU has any future plan.
And improvisations and threats do not help at all.
Then what does the EU use, if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed - the right to freedom of movement - could be discussed because of the waves of refugees crossing borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the crisis of migrants, however.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is and will never be prepared for what will follow.

They're stable, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years he received a bold gift: biological parents
Lost in ill-fated hospital, in the negura of the '90s, when she had only two months of life, little, sick and helpless, and then adopted by an established family in Italy, in the same years when the adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met again in Iaşi the other day with biological parents from a village of the county, after almost two decades when no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought to offer their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, in Iasi, to meet her neclar past.
"Jași's day", which witnessed the search for the family of origin after a few extremely vague clues, was witness to these meetings that practically broke your heart.
The report of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crinia starts 20 years ago in the rural village of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the hospital, in the city.
At home there were disagreements between parents, and my mother had to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl, and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
"When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late," Alina remembers, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and still at the time the girl's father, Costica Balkan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were to be permanently separated.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After his admission, Crina's father went to work elsewhere, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, never found her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"He would have thought she was abandoned," tells a family niece.
Because of financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one has ever been interested in the child's fate all this time, she was taken over by the Directorate-General for Social Assistance and Protection of the Iaşi Child, who then gave her to care of the Buzium Placement Center.
It was years when abandonment and adoption were easier regulated than in Romania today.
At the Buccium Center was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their baby but did not succeed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after some time this would have moved permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given her life," she tells us by smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, while she grabs her son-in-law's hand.
In the country, the parents of Crine, Alina and Costica, continued their search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the Ruginosa authorities, but he didn't get any answers where he could be his child.
The police then sent him that he might be dead, but at Ia and his parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the court that she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And conditions to look for her have never been.
We prayed to God to be all right.
I've been thinking about her in all those years that have gone by, but there's been no way we could walk, find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of Crine's biological mother.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginosa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past was a link to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," she confesses delighted Crina.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Ichim, Director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Adviser, was contacted by a knowledge of Italy, which explained Salvadore's desire to find the organic family of Crine.
And the search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started our first marches.
I just got a name, Balkan Costica, then the town, Ruginosa.
Soon I had an activity with the city hall there, and I could ask if there is a local name.
Then they gave me a few signs, just that the person you found wasn't the one you were looking for.
"It took about a month to find the girl's biological father," the Romanian chief commissioner Ichim explained.
In total, more than three months, they took the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that everyone had a home in another town.
We started the marches somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we determined that a first meeting would take place in September," added Romica Ichim.
Last weekend, Alina and Costica first saw their girl lost in the hospital halls in Iaşi 20 years ago.
The father, moved with emotion, could barely control his tears, and his hands were still shaking.
He's barely talking to the people around.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
She was all excited, trembling.
"To see your child after all these years, it's something," a niece tells us, she comes with Costica from Ruginosa.
The Christian Meeting with Mother and Biological Brother
In the discussions with his daughter, who is about to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Costique Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wanted to return to him in the village, he could come quietly: he could give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and to hang up a house.
Mom's excited, she's crying, and she hardly thinks that something like this could happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very strong emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," he tells us with great tears on Alina's cheeks, crina's mother, while he keeps a napkin tight in his hand.
In him he hides his tears, of happiness, because in a short time he will see her face after such a bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will meet in just a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm down as an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she's drawn a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to get his thoughts together, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are eventually the ones who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family meeting in Iași
In the Union Market, under the early autumn sky, the family of Ruginosa rejoined their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, she finishes high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
He no longer splits borders or countries, but only a barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian owner of the place in the center of Iaş, have passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that, in the future, if there is a chance, they will do it again.
It's the first event of this kind organized, such an emotional load, and I'm happy to be a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution dealing only with consumers, drug-dependent people.
But we're trying to redecorate companies something good back.
"If I'm still being asked for such an event, I'll do it very much," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Adviser Iași.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, departs by telling.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with guns on your foot, yesterday, at PSD.
Everybody shoots their soul
The stables in the PSD branch closed an armistice with a leg gun.
After successive rounds of discussions, carried from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the social-democracies of the former will send him an entire list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
From the end, the party's internal war seems to have taken only a break to allow fighters to draw their soul.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution to avoid endangering the party.
On October 3rd, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of the weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing certain has been established.
In the October elections, a strong competition is expected to be expected for the position of chairman of the PSD’s county subsidiary.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main function of the party's outgoing subsidiary is Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, Councillor of the county Vasile Quanta and Acting President of the Judicial Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could also be added to the mayor of Schutu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of the PSD’s Jewish councillor Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer stand in the race, sources from the party claiming that it is not interested in functions.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last few days is that of the former head of the subsidiary, Mayor Gheorghe Nikita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day can be candidates, and no one would wonder if it happened.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain also after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Bureau, a new Permanent Judicial Office and all the new leadership structures," Cita stated.
Until the organization of the internal elections, the management of the PSD’s county branch will be assured by Victorel Lupu, a close to Nikita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until September 29th, preparing the elections to be practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, the councillor of the county Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with camp Nikita.
Contacted telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in the last few days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached in support of a uniting team to deal with the county.
"On the other hand, there are several variants regarding the intentions related to the application to the Iasi PSD presidency, the list remains open," Stanciu commented.
An outgoing judge refused Vaslui rapist file on grounds of co-operation
The seven young men of Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the Iași Court of Appeal.
Vaslueens sentenced to punishment between five years and eight months and eight months and four months will present their arguments on their release today, after the Court of Justice, Vaslui, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence is pronounced.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making a request for withdrawal, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's fiancée, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How the Judges Motivated the Judgment
At the end of last week, the magistrate at Vaslui Judiciary, who sentenced the seven young men, motivated the sentence.
On the basis of reason, the judge speaks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public opinion.
"The body finds that after the time of placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, restrictive measure of freedom but not deprived of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the accused, of their families and their local supporters, a strong sense of indignation was felt at the level of the local and national community regarding the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged under a less restrictive measure", says the Judge of Vaslui.
The magistrates also demonstrated the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be "the church door".
"The institution stresses that the moral quality of the person who was injured is irrelevant, which the defendants wanted to highlight through the defenses they have formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext", it further states for reasons.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
Because of economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years cannot continue the same in the following years.
Until Saturday probably few people knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering how we could be affected by the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing leader of post-war laborers.
Marxist declared, anti-monarhist (he at one point asked Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), an anti-American ferocious and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the "Russia Today" television channel), and the terrorist movement Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and come out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is close to the United States’ favorite.
After the model of all populace demagogues, Corbyn, of course, has miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what he said and promised Tsipras in Greece until he breasted with the real world and economic legacies.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader includes, inter alia, massive renationalisation and the printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the money printing solution is not unanimously adopted on the globe, we then have a global overall prosperity! but who else prevents such details.
Of course, we can charge the bankers with blood, become some kind of left service enemies, but from what we have seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states, or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by the generous, uncovered promises made by the demagogues of the populace.
As Margaret Thatcher's attention was well drawn to, "the problem of socialism is that at some point other people's money is being spent."
Little by little I give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his belief as the party's fresh leader, failed lamentably in the elections.
And then there is still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce as a whole, and extensive automation has made the industry require a massive high-skilled hand, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from opposition, he can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its latest Financial Times, Corbyn’s choice is believed to increase Brexit’s chances and the exit of Great Britain from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a strong opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left-wing Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the crisis of refugees who are wracking from the EU's foundations, you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for the Great Britain.
But if the British decide following the referendum, which was to take place until 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep failures created within this Euro crisis and now that of refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
More than a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the franco-German axis (where however Berlin becomes more and more the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers of remaining the country in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments, which increase in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we have even recently had a demonstration in Jean Clude Junker's speech, increasingly tends to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States, consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens in conditions where electoral support for anti-immigration training, which are at the same time Euroceptic, is growing spectacular across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative load has reached higher rates than ever before.
From where, and the conclusion of the Financial Times when assessing Brexit chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from national interest.
If the voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today's politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we are going to witness a more pronounced integration of the Euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest and to that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds its populist rhetoric of the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
Because of economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration area, both caused by hasty decisions that have taken into account only integrated political ambitions, and not the ability and availability of Europe's peoples and governments to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal pressures of the EU will increase in intensity and may affect the situation of Romania.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brâncus, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Breathers: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
But behind his name is something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "skin."
What do you write about Constantin Brâncus?
What else is there to say, actually?
Figured it showed up on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising clip.
Brâncuși produces and delivers money at almost 60 years since it is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards bearing his name.
On the other hand, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with odrasla, he hears the following instructions: "Let's go to the park, to the Brâncus".
The country is haunted by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children, to elderly people.
Brâncuși's ability to infiltrate is a huge one.
Even the communists failed to remove it from Romania's memory and culture.
His cities are spreading the Internet today, getting hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would it be to say, to write about this man?
From the pile of books and articles trying to reconstitute his destiny, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that, if you didn't have the chance to be born in any big city and in a family as long as it is established, your chances of success in life are almost bare.
Brâncuși's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe this is where the following text should start.
With a sentence, as hateful as they are.
Look at the success stories of cretins, which are delivered to you every day in newspapers and on television.
Look closely at this man's figure.
You want to know how to make it alive, how, today, did he hear a whole mapmond?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantine Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the municipality of Peșșani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Marie and Radu Nicolae Brâncus.
Although he came from a family of wealthy peasants, Brâncus himself leads a modest life, but one of them would pick up his sights that would guide his artistic vision to be late.
Remembering his childhood and the places he grew up in, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Peter Túțea, from Paris, in 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people led, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything was going quiet from one season to another.
And you know why things changed?
Civilization of the city has reached us.
Brâncuși's childhood was, however, far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these early years is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the hometown of Christmas.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brâncuși was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when "at the lodge", following those who dislike the liquid to see if the process takes place properly, Brâncus captures a moment of general non-attendance.
He fills his neck with tunics and drinks on the nozzles.
He falls into sleep almost instantly.
First people just notice after a few minutes.
My mother panics, then in hysteria, believing her son died.
By evening, when Radu's father returns from life accompanied by praise, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who await him with their souls in their mouths.
The party is immediately turned into the streets.
The father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brandşa, dophtoire and minister to Brâncuşi.
The chin checks the child's breath, then puts it under the balegue nose of the horse, gathered around.
The strong grown-up child.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further the drunk, of joy, the party with lauters continues with more force.
The next day, the father and son meet in the livada.
Radu Brâncuși has Constantine collect the knots and bring them.
The father lays his baby with his head down and, with the knots brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while you feel the heat of the blows, little Brâncus has the revelation that the world can be looked at from a different perspective and that things around you can turn around.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit to old age, unless the star itself participates in his disorder.
Was the sun as troubled as his father as what had happened to him?.
At the current time, the city does not work
A parliamentarian calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop internal struggles and reorient his agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a big disband and so on.
I haven't seen any of the USL projects in 2012 to continue.
Nor highway, nor Regional Emergency Hospital, see just how politicians argue about possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let's leave the politics a little bit, gather and talk.
At the present time, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blăjuț said.
He appreciated that the current political class disenfranchised the outgoing electorate, the consequence of which was to be a very small presence in the future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the party's faithful electorate.
The MP also believes that voters will focus on traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break from the right-wing electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually on the right.
"It also crumbles right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said Blăjuț.
He indicated that he was not interested in a candidacy at future local elections, disclosing rumors about his intention to enroll in the race for the City Hall.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I'm still thinking about continuing as a Member in the future term.
I tried to call the unit for Iasi and in the lobby talks with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make a picture of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," Blăjuț said, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A colleague from Tatarași said he didn't get his money and he had to ride the bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
There's little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up the cash from the cashier's office.
At the end of my term of office I will report on everything we have spent, outside the salaries of the employees at the office and the maintenance of it.
It happened to pick up in a month and 30,000 lei, with all transport, accommodation and the others.
"Tell a parliamentman that he doesn't get his money is pure hypocrisy," Blăjuț concluded.
